1711,"     Im not sure where to start at thinking. Of course I'm used to   thinking and all. I guess. I am really sleep right now. I am always   sleepy. oh, and im so used to not doing the correct english thing.  like with caps and punctuation and all. i hope that doesnt take off   from grading. oh well. when i first signed in my native instinct was to   sign onto aim. i always do that. i love talking to my friends. i miss   them so much. im sure ill find some here that are great and i will   never want to let them go. but for now, the computer chat thing will   do. oh!! im so excited because one of my good friends that i met   probably one month before i came here is suppose to visit right   before thanksgiving holiday. he'll probably stay here for two nights   then come back to longview with me and my sister. hopefully. im   really excited about tonight. me and two of my friends from high   school are going to the concert thing at 7:20! i can't wait. i can't wait.  there are so many things i need to do. like set up an online account   for my bank, check status on my sister's book that i have to buy for   her, do the pretesting for psy class. i wonder what that is about. im   almost hesitant to sign up for experiments but i know it will be good   for me. haha. when i told my friend, his name is bryant, that i had to   do this writing assignment he told me that it was going to be just his   name over and over again. good thing its not. one of my favorite   things to do in longview is to go to book-a-million. i say i don't like it   to some people but i really do because i am surrounded by books.  there's so many of them. i love looking at pictures! the way the earth   comes together as a whole and works so well. it amazes me. its so   quiet around here. there's just the sound of typing and i think   someone is moving back in forth in his/her chair because there is   an occassional thud. oh well. i hope other assignments are as   interesting as this one. good thing i can delete my mess ups   because im making tons of them. i'm so used to having the   computer fix the caps or the right punctuations. yeah, the teachers   probably shouldnt tell kids that are learning in school that the   computer does that or theyll become lazy. like half of students. i   wish i knew some great jokes to tell. add some spice into this. uh,   assignment. well my sister did tell me one the other day but i can't   remember some of it. i hope everything is okay with judy. i know it   must be hard living in laredo with so much of nothing to do. haha,   she called last night when me and christina were watching VAN   WILDER, such a great movie, and she wouldnt shut up. so me and   christina would joke around that she was being like mom. that was   good. i love being able to joke with my sisters. theyre so much fun.  well two of them. anyway, i keep looking at the finish button and i   read it over and over again. so its difficult to think when u read   FINISH constantly. my wrist are hurting. stupid edge of the table. they   should really see about fixing that. im sure it could cause some kind   of danger to computer uses in the far future. woops. i just kicked   something. hope it wasnt important. what to think? i not sure. i look   around and i see a scanner, a white, plain wall, many letters and   numbers, some monitors, a sun(picture of a sun that is) a pen. it   doesnt really smell much like anything around here. so whats going   on with the clear mouse? i don't understand it. i mean i do but whats   the point. its like a high quality ghetto mouse. it pretty much only has   one clicker, uh button. speaking of button. i was suppose to do   something with autumn. oh yeah, she said no because i was with   someone she doesnt    get along with.   oh well her loss. i wonder   what the people in lview are doing right now?blue, i think that is one   of my favorite colors. of course its always been.

1557,"   Yes, I'm finally in college. It feels wierd because ever sinse elementary school the teachers were trying to prepare you for college, my parents were trying to prepare me for college and I'm finally here. It feels good to go home every now and then because I feel important. Just hearing the girls in the hallway joking around and laughing outside of my dorm right now makes me love the sweet old college life even more. The smell from my basketball shoes brings back great times I've had in high school on the basketball team and makes me want to try out for the basketball team here at U. T. Noticing all of my clothes thrown around in my dorm give me the great feeling of independence from my mother. There is no one here telling me what to do like clean my room. I'm feeling really good about my classes and I'm trying to get over my habit of procrastination. I can't wait until the weekend comes because the music I'm listening to makes me want to go to the club and check out the girls and dance. I'm glad I'm in college because I here that it is going to be the best years of my life and so far it has been pretty fun.     ",1
1870,"   How I am feeling right now is interesting. I have slept so long for the past few days. I think that it could be that I just moved here from Corpus Christi, Texas. Walking all over the campus is extremely exhausting and tiring. However, this weekend I did not walk a whole lot. I have just been sleeping so much. I think that it could be that I miss my mother or family and my body could be going through some sort of physical depression. That, I have no idea about. I do feel that I am getting sick. I have had a minor soar throat the past two days, and I am upset with myself because I forgot to bring my Vitamin C chewable tablets. I really like the cherry flavored ones because they taste so much better than the orange flavored ones. I know that you can only purchase the ones that I like at SunHarvest. I am not even sure if there is a SunHarvest here in Austin. I do have a large gallon of orange juice, so I will just drink a whole bunch of that until I start feeling better. Or at least until I get paid so I can buy my vitamin C pills. I just got finished taking the Pretest that is required before participating in the experiments that we students must participate in before the Thanksgiving break to receive credit for this class. I thought the test was extrememly interesting. Some of the answers I were a little sketchy. In this I mean, I was unsure if the answeres I put really reflected myself or if they were merely just answers of how I want to see myself. I have a fear of aligators. That is what I meant if I had a fear of any type of animals. I have had bad dreams about aligators, but not recently. There was one that I had and then had that same dream reoccuring the months and  even years following. Yet, I haven't had dreams of aligators in a long time. I anticipate this class, for I have always found psychology an interesting subject. Well, who wouldn't. My mother never wanted me to become a psychiatrist because she said that listening to other's people's problems all the time would make a pretty girl like me ugly. I hold my mother on such a high pedistool, that I never thought of majoring in the subject again. I am a biology major. I am still unsure if that is what I really want, or if it is something that I have been trained to want since I was a child because the field was promising. I am having problems in calculus, i really don't care for the subject in the least, but it is part of my major. I feel that if I change my major just because it has a subject that I don't care for in its curriculm, that I will quit anything, for that matter, when things start getting tuff. I feel I will be a quiter. I have never felt that way about myself before and I don't intent to ever feel that way. The class does scare me. I am terrified actually. I must keep an average of a 3. 0. This may not seem to be difficult, coming from an overall average of 3. 6 GPA at Texas A&M Univeristy, Corpus Christi. But then I was not on a Financial Aid Plan and I knew my parents would still pay for school even if my grades fell below a 3. 0 average. So I intend to persure my dreams with my mind focused and my thoughts secured on one thing, making an A in every class. Even though I know that it will be almost impossible in Calculus II, I am going to try my hardest and I want to make my parents happy. They have given my so much already. And to make myself happy, is to make my parents happy. I don't want to be the reason of my unhappiness. If I can't make myself happy, then who really can?  ",0
1703,"Wow! This has been a crazy day! I am really overwhelmed by everything. I'm sitting in my dormroom right now and and all I can't think about is last night. I'm still really really mad. All of these rude girls were running down the hall at 3:00 in the morning, screaming, yelling,and slamming doors. I got only a few hours of sleep. This really sucks especially since I came home early from Waco just so I could sleep. I could have spent the night there and hung out with Grant, my boyfriend if i had known that i would be kept up that late. Oh yeah, I really miss Grant right now! He's supposed to call me today when he gets out of class, which was about, uh, two hours ago. I could just call him but first of all, i am typing this right now and can't stop for about 14 more minutes, and second, i am trying that stupid oldfashioned stuff where you let the guy call you. The tv is on in here and i kind of want to change the channel because they are talking about Sept. 11th. That's so depressing and I think that I am depressed enough right now with all of this new stuff in my life. I liked my house and my room in my house and my town where i knew my way around and my tutoring job that payed well, and my cozy school where I have gone since kindergarten. I miss my mom and dad, and friends, but most of all I miss my dog! DID I TELL YOU THAT I MISS MY DOG, MOLLY? She is the one who undepresses me. How can you be upset when she is begging for your approval and looking at you with that puppy dog face that is that is the ultimate model of pure love. Oh yeah- I just heard something about American Idol, that t. v. show. THe girl who won, Kelly Clarkson, is from Burleson, a small towm outside of Fort Worth. That is where my boyfriend is from, which just brings me back to the fact that I miss Grant right now. Now all i can think about is the fact that I am such a typical girl; all i can think about is my boyfriend! oh well, it's better tan thinking about the mean girls that i have to live with. They are so unthoughtful. My brother told me to live here and that i would meet some of my best friends for life here. Yeah right! I hate all of these girls. All of my friends live somewhere else. I pretty much always take his advise because he is really smart and after all, he is my big brother. But i think he was wron on this one. I guess I am finished. Yeah, i better get ready for dinner, but this is pretty addicting to write all of this down, even though none of this make any sense to you. Oh well, bye bye. ",1
1857,"     well here i am, just sitting and typing. I've had a pretty long day, in fact. it was pretty horrible! thursdays are my really long days - I've got class til 7, what a drag. but the great thing is that im done for the week!  hmm, but tonight was a letdown. i was supposed to go out with this really really hot girl, but i found out that she was working - i mean, not that we had this planned, but my best friend has been pushing me to ask her out because, according to him, shes 'dying to get with me' - whatever. shes incredibly hot, and every guy wants her, so why would she want me?  thats what i think anyway. matt, my best friend, says that shes called me the hottest asian guy shes ever laid eyes on. i think thats a pretty big stretch of the truth. i think i really do have self esteem issues underneath it all. i just broke up with my girlfriend of 8 (or 9?) months. it happened over the summer. i was really in love with her. i could venture to say that i still am, but that would further jeapordize my . 05 percent chance of staying friends with her (sarcasm) - we were really good together, and when we parted ways for the summer we both cried. we had just said the big L-word that month, and in my eyes at least the relationship was just getting good. then the summer started. i was here, being back in school from a semester hiatus (to find myself, i guess. and it worked, because now i know what im doing) - thats a different story. things started out great, we would talk to each other on the phone and online whenever we could. then one day i noticed that it had been a week since we had talked to each other. this was test week for me, i believe, so my attention was elsewhere. but that isnt the reason we broke up, it was just the reason that i didnt see what was happening - when i noticed that maggie (my ex) hadnt called in awhile, i became worried and called her. she was very distant. it continued this way for another month, and i think i talked to her once during that month. then she came to visit me, and i was really excited because, while i could feel that the relationship was straining, i thought that once we saw each other things would go back to normal. boy was i wrong!  maggie walked up to me with tears in her eyes. she was hiding behind a pair of sunglasses though. the shock put me into a state of complacency. first, i totally brushed off her crying and was oddly cheerful, then she said 'let's take a walk' and it hit me like a brick wall. but i wasnt ever sad, because. i coudlnt be, i coudlnt make an emotion at all. i think that it was the closest that I've ever been to being a vegetable. all i could do was tell her things i didnt mean, like how i loved her and just wanted her to be happy, and that i wanted to be with her but not if she wasnt happy, and i could only be happy if she was happy. basically, i said the exact oppossite of everything i felt. no, i did not want to break up, yes i wnated to make things work. her reasons. her reasons were that we never fought. that we never did anything. that all we did was just be with each other and nothing else. that she had been very unhappy and got into a self-destructive lifestyle that made her look as bad as she felt. furthermore, while she was at home she made a lot of new friends and for once she felt like she was accepted. i think i hit everything, im not sure, but all her reasons made no sense to me - ok, we never did anything, but 1) i always wanted to go out, and she was always too tired. she would crawl into my arms and we would just lay in bed, watching tv 2) she came over to be depressed with me, and she got what she wanted, i mean, there was nothing i could do to make her have fun. and she was unhappy, but so was i (i was kicked out of school!) - put 2 unhappy people together and. well you get the idea. but you know what? - i saw that too, and i wanted to make things work this fall, because i knew that we would both be better individuals (damn my optimism). and she said that she got into a self-destructive lifestyle (she meant eating takeout all the time and just sitting on our asses, doing nothing, gaining weight) - 1) maggie is incredibly good looking, very pretty, and i told her that a lot because its true. she has a very low self esteem, just like i do, so maybe im being a hypocrite. and the 'weight' she gained was easily lost as is apparent by the last time i saw her, about 2 weeks ago. and the last part is the coldest one of all, but i don't think i meant much to her, i mean, i was her first boyfriend, and i thought we meant a lot to each other, but i guess when i told her how great she was, it meant nothing. it wasnt until she had a whole bunch of random guys back home tell her that it sunk in, and i guess suddenly she saw all these other choices. really, all her excuses boiled down to the fact that she HAS her pick of any guy, and that all of a sudden her love and affection for me seemed, to her, to be misplaced. i just think that i was thrown to the curb for someone better, but who knows!  im still in love with her, and im trying to chase after ashley for all the wrong reasons. just because i need a girl in my life. but more than anything, i want maggie back. god, were not even friends anymore, and thats what we were both trying to never ",0
756,"This is a really strange writing assignment. it's hard to write to keep up with your thought s. the U. s open is on tv right now, Serena Williams is playing Monica Seles. I'm not really sure who is winning but they look like pretty even competitores. Serena is eighteen and she is really improving while Seles is getting older now and she isn't as good as she use to be. It's really hard to make myself do all of the work for colloege. There is really a lot of reading and I'm having trouble deeping up. My mythology class has a lot of reading and its pretty boring so I end up putting it off. I really just do the work that I know I'm going to get quizzed over soon like in Calculus and Eco. Calculus is eadsy though because last year I learned al ot in Mr. Romano's class and the new teacher is just explaining the same old stuff. Psy is really interesting in class but I haven't read much for it because I took Psy last year in high school and we used the same book. So hopefully that will help me make good grades in it this year. I have so much reading to do for muythologe because we have a quiz on tuesday and it is going to be so hard because the teacher thinks that it is so interesting an that we remember like everything she says or assighns. The horse sale this weekend is going to be really fun. I hope we find another one like eden that will only sell for her broodmare value. I hope Shug agrees to take Cerise and Souther n I've. But if he doesn't then I guess that Cristophe will and he is a good trainer. It is so annoying that Southern Ivy's Jockey didn't listen to us in the race. He should have held her back at the beginning but he had to try to be a hotshot. She should have won. Oh well, she is only two now, I hope she has a lot more races ahead of her. She could be really good once she gets sorted out. I can't beleive that Anita's foal has such bad back legs. It seems to happen  every time when we breed to an outside stallion. I hope Brittany isn't too mad that I blew our meeting off today. But I just really wasn't in the mood to hassle with all the traffic and everything, besides, I didn't even understand the directions to the place. Oh yes!!! its already been twenty minutes. ",1
727,"The thoughts that are running through my mind at the moment deal with my studies. I am trying to do as much studying this week before the weekend when all my friends from Houston are comming in. I'm having trouble accomplishing this because I haven't managed my time to have enough time to study. I'll go to the library for about 2 hours and feel like I haven't learned anything. Aside from school, everything is going well. I have a boyfriend back in Houston and we are working the ""long distance relationship"" good. He is visiting me this weekend and so far we have seen one another every weekend. I have been with him for almost two years and ever since I have come to college, I am worried it will not work out. He is 21 years old and doesn't have a successful future as of right now. He is attending a junior college, but he isn't doing much there and he doesn't set goals for himself. I am starting to realize the importance of school and my future. I don't want to waste years of my life with someone that can't provide a future for me. I went potluck this year at my dorm. We get along great. The only flaws I can see as of right now is that she is on the phone all the time and that she sleeps really early. It bothers me that everytime someone calls for mr she tells them shes on the other line and to call back. I cannot do anything past 10:30 in the room for I feel I am interupting her sleep. This is difficult for me because I'm so used to sleeping late and doing little things like playing on the computer or watching television before going to bed. Today I only had one class which was economics. I don't think I did very well on our quiz today and I think it will be my hardest class this semester. I am currently in the college of liberal arts as undeclared and I am scared of not being able to get into the business school. I am positive that I want an office job. I am lookin into commuinications as a back up of business. It bothers me how people got into business school just because they were in the top 10% of their senior class, because I went to a ver competitive school with many smart students as where many of the students went to small schools or schools that I know I couldv'e been top ten in. I was happy to be in the top 15% in my school which took a lot of hard work. Throughout high school I took an English class at a junior college and I just found out that the official transcript I had sent had no grade on it to tranfer for credit here at ut, so I had to call the college to send another one to UT. my dorm room just got painted and it still smells in here. The people in my wing are friendly. Last night I went to an FSA meeting. Here I met people the same race as I(Filipino). This was interesting to see how many Filipinos are on campus and a good way to meet people since I haven't really been associationg with people I've never met yet. I'm looking forward to play co-ed sports with this association and meeting other FSA members from Dallas,U of H, and Baylor. My older sister was part of this organization and she got a lot out of it. My sister has been an importmant part of my life. She is a motherly figure, but younger. She has been a great role model and is there for me whenever I need her. For the rest of the day I plan on going to the library and studying and going out later on tonight. I'm looking forward to this weekend. I also have to vacuum our room and do laundry. I went to church here in Austin for the first time recently and it was very ackward. I have gone to church every sunday in the past with my family and it was weird being there by myself. I started to tear because all these memories of my family and the church arised in my mind. I've realized that recently I have been crying a lot. It's usually emotions built up in my mind of my boyfriend. He has been really nice and caring lately then he was when I was at home. I swam while I was in high school and was going to the gym at least 3 times a week. As I have been in college I have taken fewer trips to the gym. I have been lazy or too busy worrying about school. I have been gettin 5-6 hours of sleep lately. It's not that I stay up late, but its the fact that I am tired and can't fall asleep. I think it is probably caused by stress. I want to go home soon because I need to buy many things for my dorm. It's hard not having a car and being able to go wherever you want when you please. I am eating ramen noodles for the first time as a college student. I ate them at home about twice a week so I'm used to it. The food here at the dorm gets old. I get sick of the same things and same tastes everyday. I think I may be gaining weight. I really need to go running. Our televison is finally working and I can watch my soap opera. I really miss my family, dog, and friends back home. In a way I wish I had stayed back. ",0
1050,"What am I thinking? Well, I'm sitting in my dorm room alone right now. It's quite relaxing actually. My roommate has been rushing all week and finally decided what sorority she will join yesterday. She joined Alpha Xi Delta. When I returned to my humble abode last night I found our room decorated by her sorority sisters. The room looked really nice except for the balloons that made it cumbersome to walk. My roommate is nice. I didn't know her before we came here. It has been a good experience getting to know her and living with someone. I have never lived with anyone in such close quarters before. I think it's good for a person. It makes you realize just how many things you do that you don't even think about. I have to be so conscious of all the things I do so as not to disturb my roommate. That's enough talk about my roommate. I am thoroughly enjoying my freshman year at college so far. I am taking 12 hours and my classes actually seem to be interesting. I think it's amazing how much you grow up and change without even realizing it. Looking back over my life I have seem myself change. I think for the better. I have always been a lifeguard during the summer to get some extra cash. Last summer I managed a pool at a country club. I never thought I would be able to have anyone respect my authority and me. My lifeguards did what I told them too and the summer turned out great. I saw how I had to mature to be the leader where I had always been the follower previously. I just think it's amazing how you go through experiences and change because of them. That is what I am hoping to get out of college; an experience that will forever change me. I am dating a sophomore here at the university. We have been dating for a little over a year. I was extremely excited about coming to college this year because of the time we will share. Last year we had to do the whole longdistance relationship thing. It was really hard and expensive between trips and phone cards. His parents also do not allow him to date in college because of academic reasons. He is not a bad student, but they want him to have zero distractions. I don't know how they can honestly think that he will have zero distractions at college, but who am I to argue? All last year that left us with the task of hiding our relationship. We both really, really like what we have together and are nowhere near wanting to give it up. We made the commitment to work through this. It is much easier now that we are at the university because his parents can't watch over him all the time. He just left my room. We were watching my roommate's television. He is a baseball freak so we were watching baseball highlights. It was relaxing at the least. Over all I had a good first day at college. The only thing that didn't go smoothly was finding my first class. It was in building LLB, the hardest building to find on campus. I did eventually find it after asking about 15 different people. Our class was locked outside for about ten minutes though. The teacher didn't have a key. We did get in to our room after a few short minutes. I am quite amazed that I could write this much in just barely 20 minutes. I would maybe be inclined to write more, but I am extremely tired and I have to get up for my next set of classes tomorrow. I know this sounds like kissing up, but I am truly interested in this class. I hope I learn many interesting things. ",1
498,"I have a paper to start writing for English, and I'm dreading it because it will be very hard. It's about the short story ""A Room of One's Own"" by Virginia Woolf. In that story she also wrote in sream of conciousness so that is kind of weird. I really do not like the book at all. It's incredibly boring. It takes a feminist standpoint of women writers, and since I am not a feminist and only took that class because it was all that was open (I wonder why),I cannot relate to the anger Woolf seemed to have about there not being many women writers. Now, I am trying to figure out exactly what else to write about in this paper. It is really hard for me. I did the other assignment first because I found it much easier to do then this one. I don't completely understand exactly what I am supposed to be writing about, but we did stream of consciousness in my AP English class last year, and I think that it's all about writing exactly what the thoughts are that come into your head as they come into your head. My geography class is awful. the teacher is so boring. I've almost fallen asleep every time I go into that classroom. I decided to sit closer today to try and pay closer attention to what he's saying. I wonder if it's just a myth that the closer you sit the more you pay attention. Maybe that could be a psychologiacal survey we do- if one has not already been done on that. Now, I have again drawn a blank in what to say. it's so much easier to think when you don't have the pressure of having to write it down. I think my fried Alison is mad at me. She goes to A&M, and I had to write her an email about A&M's unfortunate loss to FSU yesterday. It's not like she hasn't made fun of UT. I feel like I'm back in Jr. high!  Alison and I have been friends forever- actually only since 9th grade but it sure feels like forever. I miss my friends at home. I feel like we've gotten so distant from each other and it's only been a week since I left. I talked to my friend Ann last night, and she was distant to me also. We just didn't have much to say, our lives are completely different from each others now. It's so weird how much people change from each other when you change their surroundings. I guess we were so much alike because we were constantly together. that could have a big effect on things, huh?  I wonder how long my friendships with people will last. The only one that seems to be maintaining right now is with someone that I wasn't even very close to this year- it's so odd to me how that happens. This twenty minutes sure is taking a long time to end!  I have to go put some money in the bank today. Actually I have a ton of errands to run today, but I need to finish my homework first. I still have a lot of pages to read in ""A Room of One's Own"" even though it was supposed to be read by today. Oops!  Then I have that awful paper to write over it. I mean who really cares about Mary Carmichael, Mary Beton, and Mary Seton? I don't even know how to start writing it, I don't even completely know what I'm supposed to write about. Well, it's been twenty minutes and my thoughts are becoming jumbled so I'm going to stop writing now. ",0
237,"Well, after two weeks of trying to find a computer after receiving this assignment, I finally found one. Unfortunately it is probably in one of the worst possible locations, at least unbeknownst to the owner of this computer, who is-ironically enough, my poor neighbors who suffer through hours and hours of us ( the people living next door) screaming and yelling and jumping around until the wee small hours of the morning. I can hear the people in my room pounding on the wall now. ohhh shit, this girl who owns this computer just told me, not knowing it was me, that she hates the people who live next door (ahhhh!)  I am smiling now. I always find irony amusing. They are still pounding next door. What the hell are they doing. HE HEHEEHEH-they just called us the 'Fort Worth Girls'  now that's funny stuff. I seriously have a major stomach ache. It hurts soo soo soo bad. I have been sick for like, three or four days now, I really feel terrible. My insides just hurt and every time I stand up I get dizzy. This computer is slightly difficult for me to type on. Oh well I only have 13 minutes left if I did my math correctly which, knowing my intellectual level, I probably did not do. I kind of feel bad that these people I don't even personally know already hate me and my suite mates. That's kind of depressing you know, but then hey, what can you do about it?  Everyone is entitled to pass their own judgements, how ever unfortunately. I wish my computer was working. It's really, really cute. It's a new black compaqe-compaque well however you spell it that's what it is. I wonder how I did on my French test two days ago. I hope that I did okay. I am seeing all kinds of new people. Isn't it surprising all the people that you see all the time, every day that you donÃ¯Â¿Â½t know and will never meet?  I think that that is , well to say the least, strange. MY back really hurts. I think , wow, coughing fit, that I will thank the girl who's computer this is profusely. I feel so bad now, physically and mentally. I cant wait to go home this weekend. Have my mom take care of me and see my guy that I am kind of dating. I miss him. he says he misses me. I wonder if he is sincere in the way that he expresses himself he is so poetic and thoughtful and lovely. I said that I loved him but I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t know if I really meant it. I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t know if I could ever really love anyone. After all, I really donÃ¯Â¿Â½t even think that I love myself. chocolate milk, how random, sounds totally really really good right now. Anyway, he has a boxer dog named Romeo. Very cute. I hate most dogs however. I love my cats. I miss my cats. I am glad I am getting at least this first assignment done. I cant spell for shit tonight. I also manage to talk like a sailor. Oh well. I feel bad, this girl has like left her room, probably until I leave, I guess I wouldn't want to hang out with a strange blonde girl typing on my computer either. I wonder if she is talking about me now or will talk about me when I leave. That must suck, to know that that is going to happen and well, I guess I'll just be as nice as I can be. I really donÃ¯Â¿Â½t want her to hate me but oh well. Oh hello boy in very very short shorts. That is so Montreal. I am just in extreme pain. I want to work out and I haven't in like ohhh-three weeks now. Hello freshman 15, 25, 55. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m all about gaining weight this year. My mom is going to freak out and enroll me in every diet program in the country. Maybe I just can start like, slim fast right now, save myself some time and pain with my mere. I want to go to France. I wonder what exactly constitutes 20 minutes. I really must be very very thankful. I am such a terrible person. I really really am mean. ",1
1295,"Stream of conscience. Just typing whatever comes to mind. I just woke up a little while ago from an exhausting week of this thing called college. I have made many friends, but still looking for that awesome bond, my best friend Brook and I shared. I am from out of state, so meeting people is a must for me. I meet someone new everyday; it's like a mind game that I play with myself. Can I remember his/her name? What crazy way did I try and remember his/ her name? I do want to go back home this weekend. All my friends that went out of state and those who stayed instate are going back home for Labor Day weekend. When I was small I used to spend this weekend up at our little lake cabin with my grandparents and my dad. My dad would drive up/down from wherever he was on business to take my sister and I up to the lake, for one last weekend full of sunshine and sunscreen. The word Sunscreen reminds me of the beach, Florida trips with my mom and stepdad and of course my wonderful little sister. I remember Cara and I would play Uno in the back seat of the pickup all 12 hours to Destin. Goodness writing from my conscience brings back a lot of memories. I am growing up, that's what everyone says anyway when you go off to school. Here I am its hard to believe that I am fully responsible for all of my actions, I have nightmares about not waking up in time for class or dreaming of scary situations with my friends and family from back home. A couple of ""nightmares"" I have had have truly disturbed me even after I awoke. So bad that I had to call back to Arkansas to make sure everyone was okay. Even though I new it was a dream, something inside me made me make sure. Random change of pace, but I am hungry. My favorite thing to eat in the morning is a cinnamon roll, but since I way slept through breakfast this Saturday afternoon, I will have to adjust my system to something much more healthy. My abs hurt when I laugh, they are a constant reminder of my wonderful workout last night. While most everyone was out boozing it up down on 6th street, my friend and I worked out. Seems a little ironic. A little bit of me wonders if I am truly missing anything, just the social aspect of college. I just feel that its okay to do whatever I want, and if I don't feel like getting ready to go out. I shouldn't bother with it, another part of me wonders how can I say no when I never have. I am only seventeen so I use that as an excuse until I turn eighteen at the end of the month, to decide if I want to go out or not. I bought my first football tickets yesterday, the lines weren't all that bad. I just thought this entire drawl process would just be horrible. No big deal. It did make me a little sad/homesick to see all of the groups of friends buying tickets together. Time. Just time and I will also be part of that group. Right? That is what I keep telling my conscience anyway. I am anxious to reread all of these random thoughts from my conscience to see how I jumped from one subject to the next, or even what I did write about. I guess that is your experiment or research on this. I am looking forward to the next class and the research sign ups. ",1
1000,"I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY. I JUST NEED TO GET THIS FINISHED SO THAT I CAN GO TO PICK UP MY FRIEND. I TRIED TO DO IT BEFORE BUT IT WOULDN'T LET ME. THIS IS SO BORING. I DON'T REALLY WANT TO SAY ANYTHING THAT SOMEONE ELSE MIGHT READ. THEY SAID THIS WASN'T GOING TO BE GRADED SO IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU SAY BUT I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD MAKE YOU WRITE IT IF THEY WEREN'T GOING TO LOOK AT IT. THEY PROBABLY JUST SAY THAT TO MAKE YOU FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE. I NEED TO GO HOME SO I CAN GET ALL MY OTHER STUFF DONE. I'M KINDA HUNGRY. I HAVEN'T EATEN SINCE 10 THIS MORNING. I WONDER WHERE MY BOYFRIEND IS. HE WAS SUPPOSED TO CALL ME AN HOUR AGO. HE PROBABLY WENT TO THE VOLLEYBALL GAME. I GUESS I'LL JUST LEAVE HIM A MESSAGE TO CALL ME WHEN HE GETS HOME. I DON'T REALLY WANT TO TALK TO HIM TODAY ANYWAY. I THINK  I MADE HIM MAD YESTERDAY SO HES PROBABLY IN A BAD MOOD. I NEED TO GET SOME MONEY. I DON'T REALLY HAVE TIME TO WORK MUCH. I HAVE TO GET AN OIL CHANGE AND A NEW BATTERY AND I HAVE MY INSURANCE AND PHONE PAYMENTS COMING UP. PLUS MY ONE MONTH ANNIVERSARY IS IN ONE WEEK. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO GET MY BOYFRIEND. HE IS REALLY HARD TO BUY FOR. ITS NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE MUCH THOUGH. I SHOULDVE BEEN SAVING FOR A WHILE NOW, BUT I DIDN'T EVER HAVE ANY LEFT OVER MONEY TO SAVE. I THINK ITS BEEN ABOUT 15 MINUTES NOW. I'M RUNNING OUT OF THINGS TO THINK ABOUT BESIDES HOW I WISH THIS WOULD HURRY UP SO THAT I CAN FORGET ALL THIS BORING STUFF FOR A WHILE. I NEED TO START STUDYING FOR MY TESTS. I HAVE ONE IN ALL OF MY CLASSES FOR THIS WEEK AND NEXT WEEK. I REALLY HAVE TO PEE. THIS SUCKS. I AM SO BORED. MY BROTHER IS HERE NOW AND HE IS SO ANNOYING. HIM AND HIS GIRLFRIEND ARE ALWAYS FIGHTING. WELL TIMES UP. ",1
798,"I've done this type of assignment before. Sophomore year of high school for mrs. hollingsworth. All I talked about was diet coke, because she had one on her desk. Today I went to class and I though I would be late to spanish because I was coming straight from sociology class. I didn't even lock my bike up right, someone could've pulled the wheel off and taken my frame. I woulda been walking back to my dorm with a wheel, a u-lock, and a frown on my face. It was hard to focus when all I'm thinking about during a class is how stupid I was to lock my bike up wrong. It didn't get stolen so that was good I just rode it back and I was fine. I hate riding along busy streets I never know if I should be on the sidewalk or on the street, the crosswalk or the lanes. It's so crazy, usually I just go back and forth and try not to get run over. this morning I got up and ate yogurt too quickly I felt kinda crazy in the stomach for my first classes. It went away once I was able to drink some water and let time pass. For a while I was wondering whether there was a reason why that yogurt was the cheapest. I always try to find the cheapest stuff at the grocery store. Yesterday was the first day that I used a push basket at the supermarket. I usually just walk around holding all the goods in my hands but there was too much. It was kind of a weird feeling because it was like I was growing up or something. I have to start clipping coupons and writing checks and things like that, yesterday when I was pushing the cart, that was the icing on the cake. Next thing I know I'll be getting married and crap like that. I guess all that stuff isn't so bad, but it seems like I got a grasp for the real world so quickly, but I'm not even in it yet, whatever it even is. I always think about the book Babbit, by Sinclair Lewis. He is painted in the book as some horrible guy who sells out his own beliefs and everything else so he can gain prestige and what not in his community. It's really hard for me becuase he is very human. There are aspects of George Babbit in all of us, and drives me crazy. I have a constant struggle within myself to decide whether or not you should hold strong to minor beliefs and principles and be held back in the system, or if you should try and play the system and get what you can out of it. If you play the system though it's kind of like selling out, you just become an opportunist. But it seems like you have to compromise your beliefs to certain degree. It seems like every decision I make, I don't know if I should do things to appease people and get ahead, or to hold fast to things. I'm not talking about the biggies though, just the small things. I would be afraid though that the more I ignore the small things, I might gradually start into the big things. I don't want to become like Kurtz, he had no restraint and he just got more and more into a state of immorality and all this other stuff. I'd like to think that I had restraint, but I have no clue if I do or not. I can demonstrate restraint in small cases, but Kurtz could too when he was in the confines of society. I don't know if I would revert like he did, I hope not, but no one can say unless they cross the same bridges that he did. Heart of Darkness is definitely my favorite book, it is really thought provoking and there are so many levels that you can interpret at. I read it for school last year and loved it, I read it about five3 times after that too because it's so good. I really like Joseph COnrad, but I usually odn't talk to too many people about him unless I'm drinking and my tongue gets loosened. Most people talk about sex and things like that when they drink. I always talk about Heart of Darkness, William Shakespeare, and Lord Byron. I don't really drink that much, but it's happened before and those were my favorite discussion topics. Once I tried to tell this guy about Freud and the ID, EGO, and Superego. All the sober people told me that I was 100% right in all my statements, but the drunk people just didn't understand. I don't know what to write right now, I have a lot going on right now. Most of my classes seem like they're going to be pretty easy, but I never know. ",1
332,"okay well I have 20 minutes to write this paper well isn't that exciting. I believe IÃ¯Â¿Â½m the worst speller and typer in the world. it seems like this is a really long page anyway I just wrote to my friend marissa who goes to southwest and I was going to write my friend Jamie who I meet this summer at work but I was stupid and didn't get her email address of the letter she sent me and erased so now I can't write her, she probably thinks IÃ¯Â¿Â½m the biggest bitch right now . I wonder if you all actually read these and analyze them . I want to go into criminal psychology because I think it sounds very interesting and believe it would be good for me when I try and get into the FBI I hope I can get into it. what if they turn me down. then IÃ¯Â¿Â½ll have worked all these years for it and gotten nothing from it . I think I will get in though . You know what I hate is when your hands get on the wrong keys on the key board and if your not watching you can write three sentence all messed up because of one little misplacement of the hand . I really hope you all don't read these because mine is kind of silly. anyway I slept for a long time today and I still feel tired I think if you sleep to much it makes you more tired, that's just my theory. It seems like I've been at this computer for ever because the note I wrote to my friend Marissa was really long and IÃ¯Â¿Â½m not that fast of a writer. When you stare at I computer screen real long it seems like your in a trance just like when you watch t. v. you just totally can veg out. a girl just poked her head in the door. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m down in the computer lab right now because I don't have a computer and the one my room mate has doesn't have the Ethernet set and she's hooked up to America on-line so I can't use my password to log on so I have to come down here. I really want a t. v. in my room. I know it is such a trivial thing but sometimes it's just nice to come home and relax and watch some t. v. Noelle said she was going to get one before we came down but now she doesn't want to spend the money on it and my parents and I don't have the money so we are just stuck with out a t. v. It's okay though I'm sure it's better for me. the only thing is I don't know when anything is going on . I need to find out about the ani dafranco concert for Jacob I just don't know who to ask or where to look. anyway about the t. v. I don't get a newspaper and the daily Texan doesn't tell you every thing that's going on around the world. so a t. v. would be helpful so I could watch the news. well my mind just went blank and I have nothing to talk about. I love to people watch ,  it's cool to see the way different people act. That's why I think psychology would be interesting. I like to know how people tick. I hope me and Shawnee stay best friends through out the year because I really want her to move down here next year, but when I went home last weekend I don't know if she had fun with me or not. oh well I won't worry about because what ever happens will happen. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m sure it will all work out for the best what ever it is. my 20 minutes is up now so IÃ¯Â¿Â½m going back to my room . so long. ",1
1287,"I just got back from math class, and surprisingly, I feel good despite my lack of sleep for the past 2 weeks. Or I should probably say my irregular sleep patterns. But anyway, I'm not looking forward to my economics class, but my psychology class is a different story. I like my professor, he actually keeps the class interesting, as well as entertaining/comical, unlike my economics class. I dread that class every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and I would not be surprised if I fell asleep in that class today. But there is one advantage to going to economics Salina, or should I say Natalie. I got to stop calling her Salina. I wonder if she gets offended. I hope she knows that I mean well, and besides, she's so cool. Not to mention, fine as all hell. I wonder what I'm going to do tonight, I hope I see Amy. Woooooohh deeee! She is the most gorgeous, absolute prettiest, hottest girl I have ever seen in my entire life, hands down, bar none. And yes, I am keeping Annie in mind. Annie would be a close second. I wonder how Annie is doing, I miss her. I should probably respond to her email, considering she did email me 2 WEEKS AGO! That's alright, I can just come up with another excuse, like always. That could be the problem with me. I just put things off and blame it on laziness. But I don't want to go into that right now, because I would need 20 different 20 min writing sessions. That sucks that I was just interrupted by my roommate's phone, because I was about to be on fire. I wonder how many words per minute I've been typing. Pretty good, I'm sure. It's surprising that I haven't mentioned Jared, or Dom I don't give an F about those guys anymore, and I wouldn't be one bit discouraged if I never saw them again. You better believe that. I could have hit those bastards, for the sake of keeping this writing assignment somewhat clean. Anyways, I believe that it will catch up to them someday, and I'm going to let Nature take it's course. I know for a fact that Miles doesn't have anything going for him, I mean he got fired from my friend's dad's restaurant, and then got fired from Subway! Not to knock Subway, but I would expect more out of him, or maybe not. Dom will somehow make an important person feel special, he'll win his or her respect and make a living out of it, but he'll never earn respect from anyone. Jared, I hate to admit, is smart, for now. But oh yeah, it'll catch up. All those drugs are going to bake his head, I can already see it happening. Sure, he's textbook smart, but that won't last for long. Usually, I would wish for their wellbeing, but I have been through far too much. Right now, I seem malicious towards them, but in 2 weeks, I'm sure I just won't care. Has it been 20 minutes, because it feels like about 2 hours. I'm going to check the time, I know, I know, that's cheating, but I HAVE TO! Here I go. I'm back, I've got 4 minutes left. So, there's this kid I used to know from middle school, his name is Iraj. He's Iranian, and to my surprise, he's so cool. I'm sorry, that's sounds mean, but this is middle school feelings mixed with high school feelings. He's got PINK hair for crying out loud! And I think he's the only kid that I have ever met able to pull a stunt off like that. I think it suits him, and suits him well. I'm very impressed with how he matured, not to mention his full beard. He actually told me that I used to look more Iranian in middle school, which I think is just crazy. I would say it's the other way around. Basically, he's really cool, and I wish him well. I just hope that he outgrows the not caring much about academics. It's either he doesn't care, or the alarm just went off. Alarm? Oh yeah! I guess I didn't have to check half way through. I don't think I can stop typing, it's like I'm permanently in this stream of consciousness mode, and I really like it. It's like I can express, or spill all of my feelings out, without having to hear feedback. However, feedback would be so beneficial. I'm going to force myself to stop right now. ",0
1330,"I cannot believe that I have only been back home for a couple of days and already I want to go back to UT. I guess in a weird way I consider UT my home now. It is part of my normal routine and coming home just messes with that normality in my life. I am happy to see everyone, but it just is not the same. I see things differently now than I used to and am starting to wonder if I even want what I used to. I want to go into journalism, but ever since I got to UT everyone talks of how a person should find that one thing they are passionate about. I am passionate about journalism, and it makes me happy, but what if there is something else out there that I would love even more? I am only eighteen, I could not possible know right now what I want to do with the rest of my life. I have a good idea, but I cannot know for sure. Yet everyone expects me to know what I want. I do not know why everyone is in such a hurry to finish college and have a career. Personally, I just love the process of learning interesting things. I have been waiting forever to go to college just so I could have the opportunity to learn about the literature that they do not teach in high school. Every thing that we are told in high school is so limited and lacking in truth because teachers do not want to be fired for actually having an opinion on something. In my high school, nobody was allowed to think for themselves. It was a typical high school. Academics were mediocre, but football was God. The athletes were looked upon as these heroes who meant so much to the world, when it other students who went on to some of the best colleges around. Athletes fall apart with time, but that is what no one seemed to want to admit. Some people thought all the jocks who went and got drunk on weekends were the coolest people around, but they weren't. In a few years they are just going to look back upon high school as their glory years, when there could be so much ahead of them. I do not really think I learned much in high school. I learned more in three weeks in Europe than I did in high school by just experiencing other people's lives. I had all these romantics notions of Italy and France, but really they are just other places where other people are just trying to make it in the world. I really want to go back there sometime. Germany was so gorgeous, and I thought I would hate it. In the end, it was one of the best places we visited. Most people do not have the opportunity to go there, but I think it prepared me a lot for college. I had to interact with a lot of people that I did not know really well. I also had to sleep on hard twin beds that remarkable remind of the ones in the Jester Dorms. Who would have thought that beds that bad would be an international thing?! It is kind of weird being in a dorm. Instead of having to drive to see my friends, I could just take the elevator to a different floor and see them. We are practically living together. I just hope we do not end up getting really irritated with one another. It just seems that if we spend too much time together things go wrong. We either start to get annoyed with one another and start doing the whole backstabbing thing or the group chemistry is just off. Unfortunately, it can be really easy to do that too and that is when people start to think that they hate each other. Two of my good friends are coming to school here. It really is a good thing too because I am kind of shy at it would be hard for me to meet people otherwise. I can talk and talk once you get me going, but I'm not really good at those first meetings. Things always seem too awkward to me. Then I just feel uncomfortable. I think that is why I usually just surround myself with a few really good friends. It is just easier to deal with people who know you really well than those who will base their thoughts on you from one impression. In time though, I should be able to relax and deal with all these things. I hope, anyway. ",1
433,"first, it took me a long time to get through the Austin traffic. then, when I got home, and called jenny, she wasn't ready to come over. she came over anyway even though she hadn't shaved her legs. that was kind of bad. next, I still had to deal with the fact that she had messed around with Justin, one of my supposedly good friends. all they did was kiss, but it still really hurt me. she had told me that it would never happen again after she and Kevin messed around, but she lied. I can't believe that she did that. then I told her about the fact that I had sex with heather back during the summer, so she wasn't really happy about that, but that's understandable. I still love her, but she has really putting me to the test this weekend. hen, later on Friday night, she told me that she had liked Justin, so what happened wasn't as much of an accident as I had first thought it was. come to find out, she had gotten drunk at her apartment and then called Justin to come over. that's when the kiss happened. that really hurts me. so she told me that, but she still wanted to have sex with me. I agreed, I don't know why, but I did. and then, in the middle of it, she started crying, that really hurt me. then after that, she told me that she didn't even want me to come with her to college station with her. that tore me apart. I didn't know how to handle it, so I freaked, I just started yelling at her. I don't know why, I should have been more calm , but I just couldn't do it. I tried to calm myself down, but nothing worked. I still can't believe how mean I was. and then, on Saturday morning, I called her, because I thought she was going to leave without calling me like she said she would. and then, she told me that she had changed her mind, and now she didn't want me to go again. then I freaked again. I started yelling at her. I was really hurt, like id never been hurt before. I couldn't believe that anybody could hurt me this bad, but she could do it. s I called Justin, and got a ride with him to college station. it took me an hour and a half to eat my McDonalds lunch. I had lost my appetite. I was miserable. Kenny could see that. I got to a&m, but I had no desire to party, all I wanted to do was talk to jenny so that I could apologize to her for what I said. I ate like half my dinner. it was good but I just didn't want to eat. so, we went to the party, and I was miserable, people were drinking and all I wanted to do was talk to jenny. finally, Kenny gave me the number to Amy's cell phone. so I called it, and Amy wouldn't let me talk to jenny. then Kristen answered and she wouldn't let me talk to her, and then James, her brother wouldn't let me talk to her. I was really hurt. so I got her brothers number from Justin. she had given it to him. that really hurt me, that she gave her  cell phone number to Kenny, and her brother's number to Justin. that devastated me. I just wanted to cry. it just wasn't fair. then Justin called her, and convinced her to come to the party. he handed me the phone, but she really wouldn't say anything to me. I was crushed again. the one thing that I loved more than anything in this life, including myself wouldn't even talk to me. I have never felt so bad. I wanted to crawl in a hole and die, but I couldn't do that, I had to stay semihappy for the party. it was all an act, I was not happy at all. finally, at 1230 she came over. she wouldn't even acknowledge me. her roommates hate me now, and they weren't afraid to let me know. fuck Amy, I hate that bitch. I have never liked her. I just want to beat her fucking head in. she is a stupid dirty whore. I don't care if she hates me, I hate her. I feel bad that cristin hates me. I like her. I really regret saying anything bad about her. then breiane came out and tried to start a fight with jenny. she claimed to be my friend. fuck her. she s a bitch. she acts like a stupid tease. she a dumb tease, she never gives anybody anything. she just likes to pretend like she's a whore. I don't really like her anymore, but it still hurts me that she doesn't want to have a friendship with me. and then, on the way home I got a speeding ticket. oh after I talked to jenny, I got a half-as hug, and then she hugged Justin and didn't want to let go. then she didn't even say good-bye to me. I was hurt again. back to the speeding ticket, it was for 70 in a 30. I'm going to be fucked if my dad finds out. she didn't call me on Sunday like she said she would. that really hurt. I wanted to call her so bad, but I couldn't, I wanted to so bad, not even funny. on Monday, I talked to her for two hours, it was great, we made out. I liked it so much. she didn't call me last night. she called me this morning at 7. it woke me up. I love her, but she hasn't called me tonight yet. I really want to talk to her, so I hope that she calls me tonight. I stayed up to 3 waiting for her last night, then I fell asleep. tonight, I wont make that same choice. I'm going to go to bed early tonight. ",1
1744,"I don't have too much on my mind right now, and if im worrying about anything, it may be about classes. This class in particular is not too troublesome, but this is my first year in college, and im noticing that the style of school is in many ways different. And its not that i don't think i will be able to adapt, but i am a little intimidated. The laid-back style of college allows for a lot of distractions and freedom. So i believe that if i set a pattern now to get everything that i need done, i will be much better off.   Not only, are the classes here different, but my whole social life has been turned upside down. I don't know whether i should  let go of most of my old acquaintences from high school, and dive right into new friendships. or to hang on to the people who i feel know me the best. I loved my high school years. I loved the people i grew close to, i loved the environment, i loved the things i was involved in. And now, i don't have any of those things to comfort me. I loved theatre, i remember all the plays i was in and all the fun times and great bonds i made with people. Including the director. He was like my second father, someone i could really talk to, but also someone who taught me a lot about myself. And the things he taught me really can't be put into words, but rather they can be applied to my life right now. I feel so much more grown up after growing close to him in 4 years and feel like if he believes in me, there is no reason for me not to. That may be my one biggest flaw. At times i have somewhat low self-esteem. Well, to refine that statement, i doubt myself and my worth at times. Never at a dangerous level, im not anywhere near depressed, but i do tend to put others before myself. I care so much about people in my life, and i expect the same from others. But that isnt the way it is most of the time. I put my heart out there, and often it gets passed over.   And on that subject, that is the main reason why i broke things off with my high school boyfriend. There were other contributing factors, but this past summer, i finally put myself before him and realized that i wasnt getting what i wanted out of the 8 month old relationship. I loved him so much, and deep down, i know he loved me, and still does. but he didnt try hard enough. And he says now he realizes that he didnt treat me as good as he should have, and i knew that he would eventually see that, that is why i broke it off--to make it obvious something was wrong. And it took him a long time to see that. We were best friends, and maybe that is why it took me so long to say something. Because i had so much faith in someone so close to me, i was sure i was exaggerating things, being selfish. But after enough people telling you that you deserve better, it really starts to make you think. I would always be the one putting forth the effort, i would always aplologize, i would always go out of my way for him, i would compliment him, etc. And ultimately, he wanted an easy relationship. He didnt want to have to make me feel special, even if he felt it deep down. And now he tells me this. and its very unlike him to see that he was insensitive for so long. He usually doesnt see things like that clearly. But maybe losing a girlfriend and best friend made him see things differently. I miss him though. I was the one who made this decision, i should be strong and not rely on him. But i miss him and talking on the computer to him everyday while he's at A&M lets me see the guy that i fell in love with. . especially because he is so nice to me lately. He claims that he's going to wait around for me, and that we will end up together again someday, but im not as sure as he is. I mean, i would love to be his girlfriend if he could treat me better. but we are so far apart, it seems silly of gaining a title of being a girlfriend, but being just as lonely. I need to be on my own for this new experience i am going through, and not attatched to his arm. I need to see who else is out there, this is college for goodness sake. But no matter who i meet, i will always compare them to him. I never thought of it that way, but he was my first love. Its weird to imagine that i really was in love, i never thought it could happen. But its very obvious that it was love. But for now i have to be strong, and just keep on the way things are. no matter how much i miss him. Because i don't want to get hurt again, not yet, not this far away. Im afraid things will just go back to the way they were, and i'll be 10 times more lonely. And its hard enough to meet friends here, there are so many people- i don't need to make it harder by being cooped up in my room all day talking to my boyfriend miles away. This school is funny like that. There are almost too many people to make friends. Everyone is doing their own thing, and its really easy to get sucked into hanging out with your old high school friends and not make new friends. But thats not what i came here for. I came here to meet new people, new open minded people, and have new experiences. and to redefine who i am as a person and a friend. But that doesnt mean i have to cut old ties alltogether. hmm. i wonder if its been 20 minutes yet. i think so. ",1
254,"I absolutely hate Mondays they make everything seem to last forever, except for the weekend. minutes seem longer, hours seem longer, the entire day drags without any hope for it to end. But in actuality, if Mondays were obliterated from the week, Tuesdays would simply inherit the mundane tasks of being the first day of the week and the thief of the weekend. weekends are not exactly the most practical approach to leisure activity. the ""fun"" things in life we wait to do until the weekend and try to cram everything into the two days that can not possibly be accomplished only to start out the new week  on a Monday nonetheless  with drained energy, hangovers, for some, and incredibly lethargic. a better approach would be to evenly space the week out with ""leisure days"" in between week days. also by random people taking off different leisure days, the maximum enjoyment could be appreciated due to less crowding, fewer lines, less traffic, etc. traffic is far too overrated. the idea of everyone trying to get one place at one time is beyond me . if every one had their own schedules, for instance of everyone could decide for themselves, when their necessary lunch time was instead of the standard 12:00, the roads and restaurants at that time would probably be less crowded, therefore, traffic would decrease. if traffic were lessened everyone would probably be less cranky and agitated. cranky people are just entirely too obnoxious and loud. simply because of their crankiness is everyone else cranky. its like a yawn  once someone else begins to complain about things, you find yourself griping about little nit picky things over which you have no control  perky people are the same way only usually they are responsible for the cranky people being cranky. I guess it all goes  to say that there is such a thing as too much of anything. you can be too cranky and you can be too perky    ",1
1229,"Right now I am thinking about this writing assignment. I am assessing the amount of physical and metal effort I will have to put into it. It appears to be low effort on both fronts. I have two conflicting thoughts now. On one side the easies gives me more time to relax. It is night now and I am not really in the relaxing mood. I want to go out and do something but somehow I am more dependent on other people to be able to do something than I was living with my parents. My expectations of independence have not been meet yet. I am now thinking that other people would get angered or distraught about this fact but my reaction is unlike that. I tend to just formulate new expectations and throw the other ones out. Speaking of throwing things out, the trash is damn full. This assignment is already starting to bore me and I just started it. I wish I didn't have separate classes instead just one big project that consisted of elements taught in my classes that I could dedicate my time to. I find these big projects to be more worthwhile and challenging. When things aren't challenging, I must event a challenging task or at least a large one. Physical fitness a first was one of these challenges but it has changed. Now I workout for relaxation and for selfimage. Naturally I am shy. This bothers me because being shy involves things that don't make sense to me. I really have nothing to lose by going out on a limb to talk to someone or present an idea but if I don't remind myself of these things talking to someone isn't a natural reaction. I am pronature in many respects. I am against the taking of medicine to the point won't take aspirin. I am even against vitamins because nothing can replace natural foods. I am surprised I haven't mentioned any of my feelings but the thing I am more surprised at is that I have had none. And now that I think about it I haven't had any for a long time. I used to get yelled at and grounded a lot as a kid and at some point it didn't matter any more. I got tired of being mad at my parents or vengeful toward them or feeling depressed. I was like 6 when this happened and though my parents have changed I haven't. I don't let anything affect me anymore. I have been away from my mom, dad, brother, sister, and dog and I don't really miss them. Talking about the past too long also bores me. I like looking towards the future because it gives me a slight sense of excitement. It gives me excitement because I look forward to bigger and better things. Right now I can't define things. Things used to be money, wife, good friends, and children. I dream more often now and my dreams have made things unclear. Bigger and better things like heaven sometimes come to mind. I have had a spiritual awakening. I not religious, in the sense I don't go to church. But I try to communicate with God in more subtle ways. I have a firm belief in that by believing that something good will happen, something good will happen. I never have doubt in this because you must wholeheartedly believe. The first night I was here I left my cellphone at a restaurant and 2 hours later when I came back it had been found and returned to me. I left a book for one of my classes in the seat beside me. When I came back for it, it was gone. I emailed my teacher and he said a student had given it to him and I was lucky because he could of sold it to the coop for fifty dollars. Luck is one of those things I don't have. I would never rely on chance more than I had too. It was not luck my book was returned. I am glad I am at UT or for that case away from home. My Mom is very pessimistic and impatient. These thing irritate me to the point where I like avoiding her. A categorize her in the group of who claim to be religious or believe in God but they don't truly. They are not honest with themselves so it is impossible for them to always be honest to me. I have a friend who is always lying. I think he does it to make people envy him. But I don't think he realizes I don't envy people I just respect them and try to get to their level not to be them. My mind is at a blank now. I am only thinking about the humming of the computer. Time is up. ",1
480,"First of all is my class ME 210. I don't want to be taking it at the moment but I will have to take it sooner or later. I am not good at drawing and that is what the class is mainly about. I would love to learn how to do that but I just wish I didn't have to get a grade. I am more worried abut that class than I am about second year cal. I could postpone the class and take it later, maybe during the summer, but I don't know. It will be a hard class for me. The other thing that is on my mind is whether or not I should play baseball. That is a very complicated subject for me. I would be a walk-on. However, several people who know have told me  that I could easily make the team. On the other hand, that would be very time consuming. I have a girlfriend back in Waco who is still in high school and I really want to be able to see her. I am afraid that If I played baseball then I would never be able to go home. Also, I am an aerospace engineer and I will have a lot to do besides. The other side is that I have the ability to play and if I don't then I will look back and wish that I had. I have had to deal with this issue all summer. If I do play baseball then I will likely have to change my schedule. On the other hand I think that one of the reasons that I don't want to play is because I might be afraid of not making the team or of upper classmen or scholarship player harassment if I did make the team. People have always told me not to take my girlfriend into consideration when making my decision but I can't do that. They all think that just because I am going off to college that I will find a new girlfriend, and I may, but I don't want to and It won't be anytime soon. We've already talked about marriage and how when she graduates from high school she could come live with me. She is a junior right now so she has two more years. I would love it if we could be living with each other right now. In the year that we have been going out we have never had an argument. I enjoy her company so much. Well that is what is on my mind at the moment.   ",1
744,"I have just gotten home from a two and a half hour rehearsal for an orchestra that I never wanted to be in. I signed up for this orchestra only because I thought it was on optional group. but now I have been stuck in hour long rehearsals which make me very tired and make me get home late and then I have to do all this work and then I'm tired in the morning and am achy all day long. my left shoulder is killing me right now. it's from playing the violin. I think that I raise that shoulder and so then it hurts for long periods of time. I'm supposed to call jeff in 30 min. I haven't talked to him in over a week and I really miss talking to him. it's strange how I can go months without talking to him and then once I've talked to him, I get these urges to talk to him again. sometimes it seems as if he doesn't want to talk to me, but deep down I know he does. I don't know why I'm writing this in my psychology writing exercise, but it's what is in my head right now so that's what I'm writing. you've got mail is on the television right now. I like that movie, however I just saw it this morning, since every movie is on like twice in our dorm. I like taht. we get to see all these movies whenever we like. but actually it kinda distracts me from doing schoolwork. I really wish I could paint or make art. my roommate is on the floor painting a blue sky and it is beautiful. I really like modern art and she is all into it. our room is very nicely decorated since she is very artistic. I think it's strange how kinsolving put two freshmen, both from the houston area, and both fine arts majors together in a room. I kinda like it. it gives me an access to a ride home whenver she's oging. I've never done these stream of consioucness writings before. I kinda like it, but I'm not used to it. I feel like I'm making no sense what soever. I'm going out with this guy from my high school on friday night. it should be interesting, because we haven't talked all summer long and we used to be best friends. so it might be a little awkward. but I think it will be okay. I'm really tired of writing now and I think it's been 20 minutes. so now I get to stop writing and soon I will be able to call jeff. ",0
43,"Stream of Consciousness? Well actually I've never done this before but it seems like there's nothing to it. I just tell you what I'm thinking, right? Well here is what I am feeling. Right now I am feeling anticipation because I have a load of laundry going downstairs. I really cant wait till its done. I guess this feeling of Anticipation is only natural since I am doing laundry. If I wasnÃ¯Â¿Â½t doing laundry and I still felt like I was waiting for something then that might be a little bit out of the ordinary. I am also feeling a tad fatigued, considering that I have been up on my feet all day. I sense that I could also trace that to the fact that I only  got five hours of sleep last night. I cant stop typing for twenty minutes I cant stop typing for twenty minutes. This stream of consciousness stuff is really bizarre. It really makes absolutely no sense to me. That might be considered a  feeling of confusion or bewilderment stemming most likely from my misunderstanding of this assignment. From what I write will you guys over there be able to tell  what kind of person I am? There you go, another sensation: one of curiosity. That is I wonder why on earth am I doing this. I guess there can also be a slight feeling  of frustration since I am doing  something that I do see the purpose of. One thing that I do notice is that there are no margins on this site, so if I wanted to I could write and write and write and write and make one really long line , in a sense a veritable stream of consciousness. That wasnÃ¯Â¿Â½t very clever. Anyway I was also wondering how many people create a phantom margin like I have been doing what does that tell you or me about me. Do I like order or do I like being able to see everything that I have written in front of my face. Well do you know what? Its both. I like order most of the time. I need to keep on typing I need to keep on typing I need to keep on typing. Another sensation I feel you say? Hunger. I have not  eaten in a while. Also I only ate one meal today. I guess that is a sign of stress. I am usually not that stressed out. I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t really feel too much stress. My sleeping patterns are relatively normal(except for last night). I really cant figure out what this assignment does. Is this supposed to help me or you? IS this apart of some survey or something? From analyzing all these stream of consciousness documents will you be able to certain things and similarities we all share, thought patterns and what not? By the way, who should I be talking to anyway? I have been using ""you"" for a while. I feel like I've been talking to ""you"" for so long and we haven't even met. How's it going? My name is Walker. It is a  pleasure to meet you, ""you. "" Introductions aside, let's get back to this S. O. C. nonsense. Actually, let's not; my time is up. Take it easy. ",0
239,"My name is Rebecca Webber. I wonder how many people will start out this writing by stating their name. it seems the logical thing to do since they have just finished typing it and therefore will be thinking about it. I wonder if this assignment is some kind of study that our professor is doing. he did say that he and whoever helps him would not get around to reading these writings for a long time which makes me think that he is compiling some big database to look at find stuff out about people who take a beginning psychology course at the University of Texas and what makes them tick. I wonder how many people will write about how they think that this is a dumb assignment. how come my words are appearing on the screen on one huge line instead of returning to the next line?  I would really like to have access to these writings. I bet it will fascinating to see what people will put down. can any of this be used against me in a court of law?   I am having a great deal of trouble making my computer operate correctly. that is why I am writing this assignment in the basement of jester instead of in the comfort of my own room on the 11th floor. I am worried about having to run down that many steps if there is a fire. the thought of burning to death does not scare me as much as the thought of drowning. that is odd since I am an excellent swimmer and even have worked as a lifeguard. the summer I guarded, I had nightmares about drowning. I don't want to think/write about that anymore. I wonder if Luke write his article for the Texan. I wonder if Daniel is mad about the letter I wrote him. relationships are very hard sometimes. I have two hard relationships. one with Daniel and one with Abby. gabe is hard to relate at times too. I like Abby more now that I don't have to live with her. I wish that I could just be normal where Daniel is concerned. actually that is the problem: I am normal. I am tired of this. I swam laps today. exercise is very good for self-esteem, not because it makes you look better although it does)it just makes you feel better about yourself. I wonder if there is a hormone released when you work hard at something that makes you feel good about yourself. this seems like such a waste of time. I glad to help professor pennebaker get tenure though.  ",1
2356,"At this very moment I feel anoyed and somewhat angry at what I see everyday. For example, there was a notice on my apartment door that I read after coming home from school. It stated that there was a homicide in the apartment complex. about 3 days ago there was another notice that warned about an armed robbery nearby. When I ride the Ut shuttle busses to school, I notice that now a days there is no sense of courtesy, nobody thanks the driver and students don't even bother to notice traffic when crossing streets. everyone is too caught up in their own little worlds to even show some form of humane decency. I don't know why I get angry when I think of this, maybe I pay too much attention to things I shouldn't. I have always disliked people but loved individuals, but what can be done to improve or avoid ignorence bbut to simply choose not to act irrational. enough of that. Now I am beggining to think of all the things I must do. I feel rather confused because I don't know if I should quite my job. It is not easy at all to be a full time student and work over 30 hours a week as a waiter at Antonios Tex Mex. On top of that, I just moved from apartment complexes, and I have not completely finished orginizing my stuff at my new apartment. There is an empty Burger King bag infront of me and I feel guilty. You see about 1 year and 5 months ago, I used to be very fit, I mean I had it all. I'm 6 ft. tall, and during that time, I weighed about 200 lbs but out of pure muscle, I was scorching hot. That is around the time I meat my girlfriend (I hope you don't think this is cheesy) and so we got together; about five months passed, and I just ballooned into 265 lbs. The reason I stated earlier that I felt guilty for eating the burger was because I am trying to get back in shape. And I also feel bad because I know that my partner worries about my health. But I do get satisfaction and happiness due to the choices I've made in my life, I chose to stay in school and never do drugs, also I have a person who has been with me in great times as well as tough times, and has had love for me in my horrible looking days as much as in my good looking days.

1972,"Okay, well,  I am watching the movie XXX""  I'm not really watching it because I'm typing, but I'm listening to it. I really can't type that well, so there are probably going to be a few misspelled words. My sister made me mad a while ago because I asked her to call me when her husband got home and she didn't. I looked outside because they live next door to me and his truck was there. I was like ""Okay, why hasn't she called me?""  Oh well, whatever. Oh, I don't know what to do. My friend hooked me up with her friend Carlos. He is really nice, but I feel bad being with him because I'm still in love with my ex boyfriend Jorge. Well, my friend Melissa told me that Carlos already loves me. That's not cool because we've only been together for like 3 days. I love Jorge so much!  I don't know. Man, I just heard somebody. I hope it wasn't my mom. She is always bothering me. We really don't get along. I came home and my room was a little rearranged. I know that my mom was in my room. She was probably looking through my things. That's not even cool because I had a letter by my bed that had some very personal things written in there. I'm pretty damn sure that my mom read it. She is always going through my things. I think that I probably should've lived on campus or maybe got an apartment. She is always yelling at me like if I'm a little kid. I need to get a cell phone because she is always getting mad because people are calling me. She gets mad when she doesn't recognize their name. She comes and asks me ""Who's so and so?""  She also gets mad because my friends call me late. They call me at like 2 or 3 on the morning. I tell them they can call me late though. Anyway, I need a cellular. Ah, I don't know what to do with Carlos. He wants to buy me a cell phone, a ring and send a dozen of roses to my house. I know that's sweet, but I don't like for guys to buy me things, especially not expensive stuff, but I do need a cell phone. I don't know. I miss Jorge. We were supposed to get married. He told me that he loved me and would never leave me or break up with me, but he did. He had our life planned out. He knew what kind of cars we were going to have, how many kids we were going to have and what our house was going to look like. I hate it, because I don't even know why we broke up. He gave me all of these excuses, but I knew they weren't true. I later found out, like a whole year later, that two stupid girls broke us up because they were jealous that we were together. They probably liked him and wanted him for themselves. That's another thing that bothers me. If it was because of a good reason, then I would understand, but they made him believe that I cheated on him. I loved him so much and would never have done that to him. I don't understand why he believed them anyway. If he had any doubts, he should've asked me if it was true instead of just believing them. ",1
2425,"     So I'm glad that this assignment is like this beacuse I love journaling and writing my thoughts down. I must have had the most unluck day ever today, and now my mom is mad at me! That sucks. Such is life!! Oh well. I hope that I do well in this class beacuse I really need to boost my gpa up this semester. I can't wait to get my papa john's pizza, I am so hungry. Man I can't wait for Dele to get here tomorrow too. I miss him so much. he kind of pissed me off today though because when I was telling him about my crappy day he had to get off the phone with me. Well I giess I really shouldn't be that pissed off. I'm sure I have done it to him numerous times. that's why I like him, he put up with my BS. Wow its only been three minutes. I don't know if I can keep typing for 20. this is actually harder than I though. my mind is totally blank  right now. Well actually its not because if it was then I would be thinking anything, but I an think about how my mind is blank. so it's really not blank. Ok I think I'm making things a little complicated. oh my goodnes there is this weird noise coming from somewhere in my room. ughhhh these stupid dorms. . Mann I got to a lot of homework to do tonite. Well at least I'm getting one thing done. That's good. la la la. This is getting kind of old. I have about 13 minutes to go, whoops there is the phone I have to go get my pizza is ready. I hope I don't get counted off for this. Man I'm excited about this pizza. Mmmmm can't wait. Man I'm really excited to eat this pizza. Its going to be so good. Man the smell of it makes my mouth water. I'm going to keep writing a little more since I had to go get my pizza. I wonder if my mom called me back. I really don't want her to be mad at me because she gives me allownace on friday. Man that's bad for me to think that. but I was just kidding though. Man I love chicken pizza. Its so good. Man that was I pretty cool assignment. I think I'm going to like psych class!! ",0
1499,"Ok. what I am going to write about for twenty minutes? What is on my mind? Elizabeth and I really need to get to work on getting a place to live next year. I can't believe that we have to decide in September on something practically a year away. I mean, so much can happen in a year. I think that all the girls we are going to live with are pretty cool, so there shouldn't be any problems. But, then again, I have known them for about a week, so how can I already know what it would be like to live with them for an entire year?? This is just a crazy system. Everyone here seems to be worried about things so far in advance. who is going to be my date for the game a month from now?? I don't like always worrying about the next thing. I want to enjoy what I have now. Right now I have a few hours to just relax and get some muchneeded rest. But, as soon as my mind gets to work, I start thinking about things I need to have done. The big talk here right now is the OU game and who everyone is going with. This is just ridiculous. the game isn't for almost a month and people are acting like this is some huge ordeal. If everyone would just relax and stop trying to plan everything out for the next year, than things would be a lot calmer around here. Well, I am tired about worrying about all that stuff. I've got plenty of things that have to be taken care of right now like getting ready for my chemistry test and getting a decent night's sleep for the first time in 2 weeks. I also need to figure out when a good weekend is to go to Baylor and cheer up Holly. It is so hard to talk to your best friend on the phone and just be able to hear the pain and loneliness in her voice. I just don't know what to say to her anymore. I feel like I have done everything I can to help her realize that it is going to take some time. I feel so guilty telling her about all the fun we are having because I know she is having such a hard time, but she does not want to talk about it. I spend so much time worrying about her, and there isn't anything I can do for her while I am here in Austin. I tried to tell her that she is going to have to be more outgoing and force herself to meet new people. She just isn't the most outgoing person. Once you get to know her, you would never think of her as shy; it just takes a while for her to let you into her world. I hope that she can stay positive and learn to open up It would help her a lot. Man, it is so loud here, my train of thought just got completely interrupted. Where was I?? Oh yeah, Holly. I think that I have run out of encouraging words for her, and in a way I feel like I have failed her as a best friend. I mean. aren't I supposed to be able to cheer her up and make her feel better about any situation?? I am at a loss. Well, I guess I should try and take my mind off of that until there is actually something I can do about it. I am exhausted and I really just want to go to bed, but I have so much work to do. It was just too tempting to lie in bed all day and not get any work done. Now I am going to be up so late getting all my reading done. And doing that is pointless because I am so tired that in the morning I won't remember a word that I read. This is just so different from anything I expected and it is going to take a lot of discipline to keep up with everything that I have to do. Ok, twenty minutes is up. ",1
1394,"My goodness. I have so much to do over the next few daysnot to mention the next semester. Wow, my first semester in college. I love this freedom. I want to go to sleep. I feel like I'm completely wasting the time and the freedom I have by sleeping through it all. My roommate is at a Delta Gamma function right now. I'm in the sorority. I really should be there. I guess I'm a party pooper. She pissed me off a few hours ago. I really liked her, but I'm beginning to get some weird vibes from her. Someone was caught smoking weed on our floor in our dorm tonight, and the resident assistant went to talk to him about it. My roommate got really mad about it. She said, ""That's so dumb. That's why those people wanted to live off campus. The RA said he was going to be lenient on that kind of thing, and now he's getting them in trouble just because someone ratted them out. "" Oh well. oh God. I have to go deal with some feminine hygiene issues. Okay, I'm back. Anyway. I don't care where you live. That's still completely illegal, and people shouldn't be doing that. She was just so blasÃ¯Â¿Â½ about it. I don't drink, and I don't exactly condone that either, but smoking pot is so much worse. If people are going to do illegal things, then that really sucks. But if they're not hurting anyone besides themselves, then whatever. If that's the case, then let them do their own thing. But they absolutely do not have the right to feel victimized if they get caught. That's so immature and irresponsible. I'm listening to Canon by Pachelbel right now. Wait. I have to check the spelling on ""Pachelbel. "" Yay. I was right. I figured I would be. not to sound cocky or anything. I just like when things are spelled correctly. oh. I have to press ""repeat. "" I really like this song a lot. I'm getting more and more into this classical music thing. My parents, or my mom really. my dad's not really concerned with me very much. my mom raised me to be pretty cultured. I love music and the arts. So anyway. I love this song. The string quartet played it as the wedding march at my mom and my stepdad's wedding when I was only eight years old. I was the maid of honor. Goofy. This song reminds me of one of the instrumental pieces from the little mermaid. the part in the movie where Prince Eric is escorting the human Ariel around his town. The instrumental piece is playing when they are dancing in a little square and he lifts her up just as the music climaxes. Oh. it's so beautiful. That part always gives me the chills. That sounds so dorky. I think it's just the combination of the beautiful music and the thought that Eric and Ariel are falling in love. Hold on. got to press ""repeat"" again. Sometimes this laptop really makes me mad and frustrated. The keys are so small and close together that I press the wrong one a lot. It's really annoying. I miss California. I used to live there. I feel sick. I'm also coughing because of a guy that lives down my hall. He was smoking earlier, and I was in the same room. On top of that, I've had a cold for the past four days. I'm all stuffed up, and I have to blow my nose again. I switched to another classical cd. I especially like some of the pieces on this cd. Right now, Tchaikovsky's (yes, I did look at the cd to see how to spell that) ""Piano Concerto in B flat minor"" is playing. I really wish I knew what ""in B flat minor"" means. Ok. my ""stream of consciousness"" was interrupted. I feel really bad. My hallmate called me and I've been down in her room for the past 45 minutes. Oh. I just walked back into the room and ""The Waltz of the Flowers"" from the Nutcracker is playing on my ""100 Masterpieces of Classical Music"" cd. This is such an amazing song. I miss taking ballet classes. I really need to get back into it. I'm so out of shape. I have this yucky flab on my thighs. And I really just miss the discipline and the beauty of dancing. I'm sick of all of the superficial drill team dancing that I've been doing for the past three years. It's all for show. I want to go back to taking classes where I can dance for the sake of dancing, where I can appreciate the beauty of it, where I can allow my emotions and my compassion to bring feeling into my movements. I guess I'm weird. I just get these really amazing feelings sometimes, especially when I'm listening to music or when I'm dancing. I just have these moments where I get Goosebumps and I'm so overcome by the feelings of the music. I really miss California a lot. And I'm still coughing because of that guy that was smoking. My throat hurts. I just remembered that someone the other day asked me how to spell ""throat. "" That kind of thing really scares me. I mean. We're in college, and someone doesn't know how to spell a simple word. I really hate it when people spell things incorrectly or use poor grammar or punctuation. It just really pisses me off. That's so analretentive of me, but it just really makes me mad. Okay. I have to do my homework for my linguistics class now. I must say that I had a really interesting time typing this assignment. I've never done anything like this before. I think it has convinced me that I need to start keeping a journal of my thoughts. ",1
2351,"     It is interesting to note that when I work on something in my head, I always forget what the details were unless I write it down. One thing I do remember though, are the feelings. I feel like what I had though was a great accomplishment that should have been written down to further my learning ability, particularly in math. With this I acn create a continuation, or a stream of consciousness type format within my math knowledge. This would help me learn a lot more on my own, rather than starting over as much as I do on particular problems. The only problem is I do not know how to keep a good organized notebook, rather I havjust not done it yet. I can keep things very well organized when I want t, but finding the motivation to do this , that is a hard thing to do. I wish I could find a way to ake a lot of things easier. Speaking of which, I always make things easier in math. I always say that I am so good at some things because I make those things much easier than most people make them. I do this because I am lazy. Simply put, I work on something to make it easier for me in the future. Ultimately I get easier work tat way, so I am a lazy, yet slightly thoughtful person. Thoughtful in the way of thinking, not as in the consideration of others. Well my roommate walked in the room, so my stream of consciousness is screwed. So hi!! Well, anyways what was I talking about?stuff. Ohhhh my laziness. That's a long subject. I am very lazy, but I really need to work on my laziness. I am trying to do this, my mental laziness is not very bad, but physically I don't do as much as  I like. So, I guess signing up for intramural sports was a good thing. I am going to try flag football this semester. and I REALLY want to play ping-pong (a. k. A. table tennis, as I  should probably start calling it). I was a little. Ok very. upset when I lost so many times the other day, I don't normally play as bad as I did that night. I just used a contraction, I was told not to use those in formal apers so I try not to ever use them in any type of written assignment, or even when talking o frieds, apparently I did not follow through with that a few moments ago. Well, other than that I am kind of at a loss on what to write. I am very hungry now, probably has something to do with the food I am smelling. I wishi could gain some weight. Which reminds me, I used to go around saying how much I wanted to be fat, but I quit saying that when some friends of mine told me how much that they did not like me saying that. My hands are getting tired and my mind is starting to sleep. My eyes are shutting too. Not good when I have 8 minutes and 16 seconds left. Oh well . I want to go eat now. I have a lot of homework tonight. I won't get to do anything fun, I won't ever get to do anything fun on the weekdays, I may have taken too many hours, but then again is college supposed to be asy???? No its not. ( I used that contraction again). . And I forgot the apostrophe, haha. Anyways college is supposed to be hard. So, I should probably enjoy working on homework 6 horus a day, catching up on the weekends while I do laundry, and then on the weekend nights I get time to play ping pong and be with other Dean's Scholars people and play intramural football with them. Speaking of which I played ultimate frisbee the other day. Err I mean yesterday. It was great, It was good to have some more physical activity in my life. I scare myself cause my abs. Well, where I should have abs at least. Still hurt from limbo three days ago. Also my legs hurt to. My roommate just said scrotum. I have no idea why. Scares me a little more . Just thought I would let you know that. He is nuts, I guess I should go back to what I was tlaking about earlier. Food. Haha, I wonder how many words I can type per minute, this would not be a good excercise to try out that theory though, cause if you take an averageit will be a lot lpwer cause I am getting very tired right now, that and I am not punctuating very well, and I am using contractions without the apostrophe's. My roommate just reminded me of George Carlin. Funny man!!! You should atch his stuff sometime, its hilarious. I am talking as if there is someone going to read this. Oh, only a minute and a half left. My eyes are starting to see some funky shiznit on this screen. Man, I am Hungry. !!!!! heh, I just looked at the time and it said 19 11, reminded me of 9:11, I see that all the time, or at least I used to on the alarm clock, or any clock for that matter, then I got hurt and it no longer showed up.

670,"Well, my mother has just gone back to India ten minutes back, and frankly I am not all too sad about that, or not as yet atleast. All these days there were a lot of things I could not join in because I felt obliged to spend time with her and honestly I enjoyed myself. What made me most uncomfortable was the thought of what others would think. Would I be able to be a part of a group?    I have never really been one to mingle in a crowd. I suffer from what I call the "" wall paper syndrome"". I feel like the audience to a television program where everyone is settled in their roles. I might have just been flung inside and there I am trying to fit in, wanting to fit in but getting so so intimidated!   Everyone here seems so confident of what they are doing and saying and whats worse is that they are probably doing the right things, though who decides what is RIGHT and WRONG I am yet to discover. I come from a different culture and background. I have always excelled in academics but here I find myself doubting my ability. Will I be able to cope with the new system? Will I ever belong?   There seems to be a yearning to be accepted and appreciated, that I am terrified that revealing my true self, which I am not too sure about, might mess up all my chances. Every one seems to be better than me, be it in terms of making friends, getting adjusted or simply being themselves. I feel that every second person is laughing at me. I feel so lonely inn this huge university. This is the worse feeling to have, feeling alone in a crowd!   They say that everyone feels the same way in the beginning. But do I believe that? Obviously not! Here I sit in RLM writing frantically about my nervous self and everyone around me is reading either their reference books or a newspaper, no matter what they do, they seem to be at peace with themselves. that is what I am hoping that sooner ar later (sooner if it were up to me) I will achieve. I came here to let my self lose. To undo the shackles that had bound me to a not too pleasant past when it came to self esteem. I want to be able to do that. I want to be able to be the person that lives in my dreams. Again am I trying to be someone that I am not? I know that it is not in me to go up to a stranger and start of a conversation. I stop after "" Austin is so hot""! Is it wrong? Does that make me in any way lesser than the rest? Rationally speaking obviously not. that is the kind of person I am. But everyone I seem to come across is so extroverted. I know that there is no such thing as right person or wrong person but feeling seem to surpass reason at this point. is it because I grew up with asister who was always popular because of her looks and her gift of the gab. Who had all the night life I never had, and said I never wanted. Is it because of the mother I had. Always the center of attention because of her looks and her brilliance, because of her great achievements and ideals. I don't think it fair to push the buck on to someone else. I must learn to take responsibility for myself.  It is so strange. I always wanted to come down here. It was the perfect picture. I was going to start afresh. This was going to be the birth of a new self. What happened? Am I giving up all too soon? Am I alone in feeling this way? Will this small fish find her way in the large ocean? Will someone notice the wallpaper? Will I be able to come out of this a surer person? WILL I BE ABLE TO FIND MYSELF, FOR BETTER OR FOR FOR WORSE, IN THIS CONTINUOUS FIGHT TO FIND MY PLACE IN THIS PUZZLE. (that is assuming that I have a place!) ",1
1288,"Dear Sir or Madam: I am writing to inform you of my recent achievements, thoughts, feelings, and general relevancy of life. I have been under some stress for the last few months due to recurring repercussions of the recent divorce of my parents. I am and have always been one who stands and is ready to be strong for others, but some time it takes more strength to cry. I am glad that my involvement in dancing had led me to this time so near my departure for the Olympics. This had helped to separate me from the hectic antics of family. Although it has given to great an amount of time to reflect upon my inefficiencies. Again as I type I am thinking I am wondering as if this incoherent gibberish will be or can plausibly be translated into recognizable human thought and used in my aid. This in itself has become a major threshold of relief for me. Confrontation of my fears has always been a struggle. Fears a plague of man for centuries, we can find cures to anything but be most tormented by nothing more than our own conscious being. See, as I continue I have diverged farther and continued in my pursuit of happiness and my race against fear. I fear that I am losing control. Not of myself but of family. They stray farther and farther from the objective, but seem to relentlessly ignore the many warnings and offers of aid from their peers. Is it true that we are not safe from torment even without villain, or can it be that the most prevalent villain be he who lives within us. Tearing at each muscle and heartstring, pulling our every emotion straight from the gates of happiness to the pits of despair. I've dug myself into this hole and finally confessed, but the only my own strength can bring me out. Ironic isn't it. I am not nearly psycho or even remotely suicidal, but life can bring one down. A carefree person is at the greatest risk, because it is with that lack of care that you neglect to watch for the advance of the ranks of despair. I have yet to find the reason or meaning behind any so feelings. Let alone answer any thoughts or feelings of my own, but simple writing forms a haven, safe place, or a virtual escape from the locks of my own mind. Only as I overcome the fallacies that I have founded my realities upon, may I escape the shackles of my own torment. I really have no problems, other than an overly kind heart and mind that troubles me more than worth. How can I escape my own shackles when it is by the same power that I am confined that I am held captive. My thoughts are low and stamina lost but open freely now are the gates of hope. Once again proving that the pen is far mightier than the sword. ",1
636,"I don't know how other people (freshmen) are coping with this new transition from high school to college; I feel stress out. Hmm. maybe I'm not so completely at ease like I had claimed earlier. I suppose that I am at ease at this moment is because I don't have any class to go to for hours, and that I think I am at ease right now, is because this is the second week of classes. However, I'm still stress, very much so. (I feel like I'm rambling on and on here. ) I am so very much relief that I have done the pretesting to get one credit hour of the research experiments. I like to try to do things ahead of time so that I won't be in any jams later on. Besides, what with the way my schedule is set, I have to budget my time wisely. Moreover, I am worried that I won't be able to get high grades as I did when I was in high school. Everything in college is so very different and challenging. Sometimes, I feel as if I can't keep up with other people. I admire those people who seems to have everything in control and makes everything so easy to them. I just can't do that. I'm the type that has to put in ""extra work"" so that I can keep up with them. I'm not saying that I'm stupid, gosh no! I believe that everyone is unique in their own little ways. Hmmm. there is one thing, rather, one small minor fear  that I just can't seem to overcome: fear of animals, especially dogs. Well, I took the pretest and in there, it had asked me questions about animal phobia. I really want to know what these fears mean, which brings me to another thought. I always have questions, such questions that are so detailed some people called it ""stupid questions. "" I always find myself having questions about everything. I guess  I'm just a curious person. Hmmmm. I guess this is enough typing for this assignment. I can't think of anything else to write about. Who ever is doing the reading on this writing assignment, I'm sorry it isn't anything that is as exciting as you'll like it to be. ",1
1965,"I am so tired. This headache is really getting to  me. I wonder if I can make it through the classes today. Why is my foot numb. Sleeping on the floor last night really hurt. I wish the little boy did not cry so much. I hope I will have enough money to go to Brazil for Christmas. I really miss him. It is so hard that his parents don't like me. I know they don't, even if he says they do. Wow my headache is going away. I think I am  hungry. I won't eat until 11:30, that way I can make it through my classes. I am dreading the first one. Social work is so boring. Why did I get myself in it. Man my stomach cannot wait to eat. ouch. I need to clean my sheets. I need to read first though. I wish I had a more comfortable chair in here. I need to save my money. I hope I have enough to last the year. This sucks struggling to have enough money. I should not cross my legs it is bad for the blood flow. I need to stand up straight too. Slouching is not going to help what I already did from sleeping on a floor with no pillow. Man I have so much to read. All I want to do is sleep. I cannot sleep though I have to read, run, work, go home this weekend. I am dreading that. All I want to do is sleep and I have to get up so early just to go to church. I wish Granny would just let me sleep in once. At least they do not sing in the Mass. I keep messing up in my writing. ahhh! This is driving me crazy. I need to correct all my mistakes too. I hate mistakes. I hate messes. I hate the fact that this computer is a piece if junk and I cannot afford to buy a better one. I am lucky in life though. I admit that. I should be happy with what I have. There is not use telling myself this,  it only makes it worse. It just makes me think of everything that is wrong. I wish I could disappear for a little bit. I wish I could go back to Brazil right now to be with Rica. He makes me so happy. He makes me realize how great I am. He shows me how much he cares. I am so happy he is my boyfriend. I just wish he did not have to go back. What do his parents expect. I cannot  speak Portuguese. How was I supposed to talk to them. They cannot know what kind of person I am. I tried to stay out of the way. I did not know what to do. I think they are not telling him the whole truth. Of course they  would not tell him that they do not like me. Plus he is moving here later for me and he is their baby. They would have to deal with Carlos again. There I go crossing my  legs. This room is freezing. I only like it like that at night. I wish I did not worry so much. It makes my head hurt. I wish I did not have to worry for  just one day. Everything is going wrong this year. I do not want to call Dad. He will just talk about bills and the divorce. He will  sigh 500 times. He will make excuses then talk about work and ask why I never see him. I hope he does not talk about when he went to church for the first time in 25 years. I do not even like that church. They only make fun of my religion. I need to learn to be more nice about it. I just don't what that weird place converting my Kylie. I worry about her. I worry about Kalan. What is going to happen to them. Quit crossing your legs. I wish my nails were long. They are so thin. I need to go to the store for food. I need to save my money. I can deal with the food the dorm gives me. I will just drink water in my room. My car stinks inside. I hate when I get out and I smell like smoke. I should check the oil. I will do that today after I run. I cannot believe I went from 12:50 to 19:40. I was doing so well running before. I did not change anything. I hurts now to run. I cannot breathe. I do not want to go to the doctor. I just need to get used to the air. Although I have been back home for a month now and the air was not much different in Brazil. I hope the shot of pain that goes through my  heart goes away. I just imagine an artery clog. I am so young and I eat healthy. I bet it is stress, or I am not breathing correctly. This itch on my nose needs to go away. Quit crossing your legs. Type faster so I can keep up with my mind. This is kind of hard because I think of what I type. There goes  my nose again. At least I stopped crossing my legs. Yay, I am almost done. I am hungry too, but I have to  wait 12 more minutes. I should have had something little this morning. I  hope I don't get fat. I am already fat as it is. I need to get rid of this stuff. It is so hard. IT will not go away. It is just that one area. I will get surgery when I am rich. h ahah that is a good way of looking at it. Like it will ever happen. I do not even know what I want to do with my life. Why do I worry about all this stuff constantly? ",1
2067,"This is a strange colored screen. I'm glad the page has a timer at the top, I really didn't want to keep track of time myself. I have so much work to do today, I'm just glad that I have lots of time to do it. I should probably make sure that I don't misspell words and all of that, it's not like I will have time to check it over when I'm done. I almost feel bad for whoever has to read this, I mean there's probably going to be a large amount of frighteningly boring writings (including mine). Trying to write this with the TV on probably isn't a great idea either, so off it goes. This weekend should be a good time, but I'm still not looking forward to it. I still need to get a birthday present for a friend of mine as well. I should look online to see if she has anything going on the day of the Mars Volta show and get her tickets, that would be very cool. Knowing my luck she probably won't be able to go, but I should still try. Her parent like me enough to let her stay with me, but I don't know when she would go back home. Hopefully she won't have a game that friday, or else none of this will work. I still need to help Jessica with her homework, and somehow find time to go to practice tonight. This band really isn't as much fun as I thought it would be. In fact, the music is really boring me. I should talk to them about possibly adding or taking away parts to make it better. These guys listen to way too much indie rock, which means I probably won't have a good chance of making the music any harder. This is going to be a very long writing, so I apologize for whoever has to read this. I hope studying for Latin doesn't take too much time tonight, because I need to get to bed early. It's amazing that I can wake up at 11:15 to be in class by noon, yet I am still tired even if I got like 10 hours of sleep. I don't know how people go to class at 8. I tried an 8:30 class this summer and I ended up not going to it more times than I went. I always figured that going to class would be the easy part; I was wrong. I can still manage to fall asleep in any class so long as its during some sort of lecture. Maybe one of these days I should go to bed at like 8pm and just see when I wake up naturally. Chances are I still won't get out of bed before noon. The night is such a better time to do things. Its not incredibly hot, there's not as many people out, and there are a lot more interesting things to do at night (say on 6th street) than there is during the day. Granted you can't exactly go clothes shopping at 2 in the morning, but you don't get to see bands play during lunchtime either. I can't wait for next weekend. Going down to San Antonio to see my friends play is going to be a great time. Hopefully I can get some more friends to go with who might like their music. If not, oh well. They are playing with another band that I really enjoy as well, which should make for a very enjoyable time. I should spend more time in San Antonio, there is a lot of stuff to do there. 6 flags is nice if you have the money, I just don't have the money as of late. I should really try to find a part time job up here so that I can have some resemblance of cash flow. Maybe get a decent job and save up enough money to go somewhere this summer. I would really love to go on a cruise or something like that. Unfortunately, I will probably end up spending the money on bass gear and food. I need food to live though, and bass gear is always good. I still need to do the pretesting after this as well. I don't have a printer either, that could be a pain. Hopefully I can just save the page for printing and simply print it out after I go buy a printer. The time is almost up and it really didn't feel like it took long at all. Maybe that is because I'm used to writing like 6 page papers, I like the simplicity of this. I wonder how many grammar rules I broke during the course of this writing. Oh well. ",0
1653,"     I am sitting hear at my desk in the dorm listening to Ashley in the kitchen. I   hear the cabinets shutting and bowls that are clanging together. I wonder what   she is eating for lunch It kind of makes me hungry too. Now I'm thinking about   when I'm going to eat . I have my discussion class in another 40  minutes across   the street. I'm worried that I won't make it to the psych SI meeting afterwards   because there are so many things to do. I told Katy and Jenina that I would go with   them, but I really want to go by the party on the plaza to see all the clubs and   organizations. I'm not sure why I want to go by there. There are so many different   organizations that I want to do and I am feeling so stressed out right now with all   the options racing through my head, but i don't want to overcommit because then   what if I can't handle the coursework and my grades drop. That also worries me. I   have three tests coming up next week at least in my huge intro classes. I am so   confused as to what they will be over and how closely I should be reading and   what I need to pick up on. That is why I really need to go to the SI meeting today.  Hopefully that will help. So now I am thinking back to what organizations I want to   join. I am already feeling so overwhelmed with having to squeeze in 10 study   hours a week for Kappa Delta. I don't think that much time is unreasonable, but it's   just that I have to walk to the house and that takes time and then I might run out of   reading to do and just end up sitting there. If it weren't for the rowing team, I would   be able to spend plenty of time there, but it just so happens that I row in the   afternoon, so I can't really get anything done for a solid length of time. That   sidekicks meeting was fun last night, but I really don't think I can go to the party   tonight because I need to sleep. I always falll asleep in that RTF class at 8 am and   I need to be alert. Oh, and I have that spanish composition that I need to learn   vocab and the verb forms for. There is so much to do and I'm worried that I just   can't do rowing because  it takes so much time, but maybe I'd rather be playing a   sport then watching it liek the sidekicks organiztion. I just don't know. I also want to   play volleyball, but I can't decide what level to play on. My FIG is starting a team,   but will that be frustrating because we won't be good and I want to play   competetively or will it be relaxing and fun. I can't decide!  I really want someone to   tell me what will work best because I just want to enjoy college. Ashley just flushed   the toilet so that water is running. I wonder what is wrong with her. She's been so   upset the last few days and it's weird that she doesn't stay here some nights. I think   it's boyfriend problems, but she won't say. And I think it's weird that Tim was over   here when I walked in last night. If I were Diana I think that would weird me out, but   I guess I shouldn't worry about that. He seems nice though.  I miss everyone so   much. I love Anna and my KD girls, but life just isn't the same. I don't want to be   home, but I want all my friends to be here with me. No one understands me liike   they do and I miss all the closeness that we had together. I especially wish jennifer   and Becky were here. I need to be harassed by Becky in her caring funny way   and I need Jen's crazy overexcited   guess what   every now and then. I hope   Ashley is doing well. She's probably in London right now. The T. V. is on in the   next room and I hear a motorcycle outside. I hate those things so much. They are   so dangerous. I can't decide what to do tonight. I want to go out and meet guys, but   I really shouldn't. I hope that Paul guy doesn't call this weekend. He's the biggest   player. Oh I wonder if I have OU tickets yet. I can't believe they're only giving out   2,000. I really need to get to class. I feel guilty after all the september 11th stuff   yesterday and not going to the candlelight ceremony, but I just get so depressed   after seeing it over and over and then not being with the same people I was at this   time last year makes me sad. I miss everyone so much, but now I need to go to   class. ",1
781,"I have too much to do today. I should go work out. I need to learn to prioritize. Its unbelievable I have met or at least introduced myself to since I hae lived here, I need to work at remembering names. I like my classes so far, all in their own way. Calculus is the weirdest because I don't remeber much at all clearly from high school yet I kinda like bein confused like that. I wonder how all of my friends are doing form high school?  I hear that the football team is using more of a passing game and I wish I was there for it all. I need to call my friend Jonathan, I can't wait to go visit him at Texas A&M. I've been writing for fie minutes now, its going to be a while. I need to go get I computer, I am tred of always waiting in line or bumming other peoples'. I'm gettin pretty good at spinning the pen on my finger, its kinda embarrassing if I do it in class and I miss. I wonder if my dad is going to get the new car or not. I would loe the chance to drive it. I would race cars if I could but I would be entering the field kinda late and I don't even know where to start. I wish I hd the time and money to take driing lessons this summer, then I could at least go to driev on a track if I had the car. Theer are too many things I want to do when I grow up. I like to be able to do everything, but I also want to marry the perfect girl and have the best kids and spend all of my time with them. I'e been writing for ten minutes now, I'm getting closer. My hand is starting to get kinda tired, I have multiple thoughts at the same time and I can't keep up with them all at the same time for this paper. I need to do my laundry, htose sheets I hae are still kinda stiff. I wish I had'nt slept so late today, I wasted half of my day and I missed a class too, it was probably the only time the teacher has gien a pop quiz. I want more cool signs, I think my walls are so bare, I want to have a room I enjoy being in. I get kinda lonely here by myself sometimes, but I think I am glad that my roommate never showed up. It gies me a lot more freedom. I can't wait for this weekend, hopefully I can get enough peopel together to go cliff diing. That guy in the hall is gettin on my nerves, he worries too much about stuff, the prob is I kinda see the way I used to be in him, and wonder why I eer had friends. so far college is a blast though, I'e got all of my old friends that go here, plus all of the people that I have met, so I always have something to do, but thats the problem because sometimes I don't get stuff I should get done finished. It's kinda my fault too though, I think I kinda aoid doing homework and such. I want to go see a movie sometime, its been a while since I'e seen one in a theater, I need to find a cool girl to go with. I really don't have and good thoughts now, being interrupted is kind of a hassle. There are lots of people I need to call, I should do it soon, many people I enjoy spending time with and I havent seen in a while. I have two dictionaries up there that I havent even used, I feel kinda bad but I havent had any need for them yet, n/m, I am supposed to look up some words for that seminar class. Oh well, I'm finally done, but I htink this is kinda cool, it takes  a while to get into, but once I was started I think it was fun. ",0
789,"I don't know what to do with my boyfriend. I am so distracted by him and I should be studying and trying to do reaslly well my first semester in College. I don't really feel that great today. I really feel like taking a bath. It would be really cool if our neighbors would urn down the music so our walls would stop shaking. I wonder eho the package is from that I got. It is really stupid that I won't be able to pick it up until Tuesday. My room is pretty lonely and the show on tv is pretty weird. I miss my roommate already. Maybe I should have gone home this weekend. Oh, well I guess my weekend is going ok because I got to see both Jared and Eddie yesterday and that made me happy. I miss Jared right now. I wish  my siter was here. We would have so much fun. I heard that she already took over my room. I don't really know what I think about that. I don't know how I am going to get all my work done, I can't believe I slacked off sp much and I would have had all my stuff done already. Oh well, I guess next time I will do better. I hope that I will be able to get my application to the Texas Spirits this week so I can start meeting people. Maybe I should have joined a sorority so that it might be easier to meet people. Hopefully with the things I am attempting to join I will be able to meet some more peope. It is so hard to meet girls to be friends with. Boys are so easy to meet because they almost always talk to you and try to get to know you. Maybe it is just hard for me to actually meet friends and not just acquaintances. All my frinds from high school were pretty much people that I had been friends with since CAtholic grade school. Making it not very common for me to meet all differnet people form many  difference places. Ut is sp doverse and so absolutely different from anywhere I have been before. Except for New York City, I guess. But I guess it is wierd because it is such a mix of people that are all my age and all here for the same reason and I guess that is prety hard to comprehend. I wonder ho Jennifer is at LSU. The last time I talked to her , she sounded like she was having the time of her life. I hope she doesn't forget all the fun we use to have and doesn't change that much. So far, it seems like Kristen and Colleen have changhed a lot and they have only been gone a toatla of like two weeks. I haven't talked to Sarah at all , I hope she is doing ok. I wonder if she has met WEs yet , I bet they would get along really well. This wirting is completely all over the place. I am not really sure how this shows the way my brain works. Iguess it has been about twenty minutes. so I guess I can end my rambling. ",1
1997,"Right now I am really hungry. I would go eat right now but I am going to run with the marathon team tonight. I ran cross country in high school and was pretty good but I did not run during the summer. Lets hope I'm still in shape. Probably not, I'm going to have to start back at the beginning with two or three miles and work my way up again. This stream of consciousness in not fun. My thoughts are coming out too fast for my to type. It's like when I'm writing an english paper. I'll get a great idea in my head then not able to write it down fast enough and I forget it. Good thing you aren't checking spelling and punctuations and stuff life that. I hate typing on the computer, well not typing but talking on the computer. The I'M stuff instant messaging. My roommate keeps asking me questions while I'm doing the writing. She talks on I'M all the time. She spends more time in the room on the computer than I do and that's hard to do. She wakes up in the morning and turns on her computer to see if anybody is online that she can talk to. It's 8 o'clock in the morning does she really think anybody is going to be on. I never liked talking on I'M and I've tried to. I think many of the things I say are sarcastic and it is hard to show that what you are typing has a sarcastic tone. So I pissed of a few people even though I was being sarcastic. And it could be that I am quiet and don't talk that much unless it's about sports or something. I'm weird, I think I'm the only girl in the dorm that likes to watch football and other sports. I have always liked to watch sports. And I pretty much know that I am the only girl that likes to play football on play station 2. I've always liked playing video games. Like right now I have Grand Theft Auto Vice City on my computer. It is a lot of fun. I love playing. I see it as a stress relief for me. When I had a hard day I'll start play the game run from the cops then feel better. I am able to do things in the game that I would never do in real life. I would never be stupid enough to run from the cops in real life and that's why I like to do it in the game because I can and will not get punished for it. The people who go around saying the game should be band because it is violent and gives people bad ideas make me mad. Even though there are people in the game you can tell they are fictional. All the cops look the same, all the pedestrians look the same. You can tell that this is not real life. If you are running from the cops in the game you can drive around and pickup police bribes which lowers your wanted level and less cops chase after you. Now I know that does not happen in real life. There are clear distinctions between the game and real life. I know those distinctions and would not cross them. Some bad apples that were probably high or drunk anyways that ran from the cops and blamed it on the game should not ruin if for other who think the game is fun. ",1
1389,"Great! Now I have to do this crap on paper! My stupid com. Heard sound. Sounded like my modem, but it's not on. Stupid itches again. This time all at once. I've been itching a lot lately, but it's probably the weather. Popped my thumb. Popped it again. I tend to do things in pairs. Tingling foot because it was in a strange position. I hope my fingers don't give out. Itchy left ear. It's been only 3 minutes and it's already hurting. I certainly hope I don't get carpel tunnel. Ouch! Itchy nose. head. Eyes doing that weird thing, almost like I've stared too long at one thing. Many little itches. 5 minutes now. Maybe I'm a little conscious of how the time is rolling. But then again, that's probably I have a little over an hour to turn this in and finish pretesting. Should set comp up, even though she keeps dying on me. Hand hurts a little, had to flex it. Mmmmm. Good Snickers bar. It's going to be difficult to write any feelings beyond the physical down. I tend to be in a state of. no state most of the time. 13 minutes left. I hope I can keep. Itchy nose. Feeling in the stomach. Hand still a little achy from all the writing. Wished my comp hadn't crashed, else I'd be done by now. Itchy scalp. I hope I'm doing this right. Figures. Comp restarted again. I guess I should turn it off after it restarts. Don't know why it's been such a pain lately. 10 minutes left. Itch to the side. Stretch fingers. Itchy feeling in left foot due to position. Itch in left ear. Gee, I hope these little itches don't mean anything. (feeling amused) Stretch aching fingers. Getting peanut out of teeth with tongue. Comp restarted. Time to shut her down. Hopefully, shutting down properly will end this mess. Popped thumb. 7 minutes left. Soon. Real soon. Well, physically anyway. It'll probably feel like 15. Turn off comp. I hope I can. Turn off power. I hope I can put all this to the web page before time. Ho. Itchy nose. Inside Eyes water. It's a sneezer! Eh, maybe not. 4 minutes left. Guess I should just trust the timer now. Hope I'm. doing this assignment right. But then again there is no right or wrong way to do it. Speaking of which, what ""is"" this assignment for? What does it do? Yeah, we write down our thoughts for twenty minutes, but. 2 minutes. Why? What do we learn from this? Or is it for the prof. and the department? Don't see what good it could do either. One minute. The clock will beep soon. Better prep for it, lest my heart jump out of my chest. Heart beat increased a little. Heart jumps! (Timer went off) ",0
1767,"This seems kind of odd to sit and write to a complete stranger. I wonder if i should try to be grammatically correct, if I should capitalize my letters. Normally my mind is very poetic in it's way of thining. I can walk around daily thinking of poems, constantly creating poetry out of the world. Then there's the side of me that is analytical, am I typing too much? Why am I talking to myself? Damn a minute is a long time? There are always questions. I've always had a fascination with animals, this in turn make me grow way too fond of my pets. I believe it's personally healthy for me, but it is controversial. . (no i do not do vulgar things with my dog). I have a weenie dog, and she is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I got her when i was really sad and it is her that lifts me up. The breed itself is funny, their length is their personality. It is also amusing that I, a man hating lesbian, have a weenie dog. My room is really hot right now, i'm here thinking of leaving, not sleeping; I already sleep too much. You would think it takes longer than five minutes to think this much but oh well. I feel like i'm talking to myself but it's odd to know that someone will read this. What happens if someone says they will kill themselves. do you shrug it off, or do you intervene? I think i would like a job were i just sit and read peoples thoughts, i think maybe 20 minutes might be too long but it's not a big deal. It's like i'm turning paranoid, i'm starting to think of things to write, like my outfit or my hands, almost like when your senses are on high and you have acute hearing and taste and smell and touch. That's when you are precise, you know what you are talking about. There is alot of dissapointment in the senses. Our mind has such an imagination that we are often dissapointed by what it really feels like or something such as that. I also wonder what this expiriment is for. What is it that you are trying to get out of me? My age you know, my life you never will so what's up your cranium?  That's a funny thing to say. My mind is slowing down and i don't have that much to say. i don't really think i can do this continous thing.  Is it ok if i pause a few times. It's weird the things people are worried about, like what could you possibly do to me if i said vulgar things to you on this assignment. I watched a good movie yesterday, it had a cheater in it, something I now can relate to. It's not good to feel that, never will be most likely (unless jealousy ignites your desires). I only wish I never do that to anyone, for I know how it feels and it is from that that I do not want to hurt people. but i know i might not be strong enough to substain. so i leave my door open to things, to everything and i wonder now that it's the end of my time wether or not it automatically cuts you off at 20 minutes or can you finish your sentence. I guess that is just a common worry, but if it's not maybe i'm just paranoid.    ",0
530,"I don't have to follow any rules except for the ones that I create for myself. As the days have gone by I have slowly but surely felt that I am alone. Not being without my family has created feelings of sadness inside. I know that all of this is just part of life and a certain period of adjustment that everyone in life must go through. I have done some crying and soul searching alone in my dorm room. I am expecting that my time in college will put me to the test and show me my weaknesses and strengths. I have been forced to come to terms with the fact that I am now the only one responsible for my well-being, time management, and academic matters. I must now assume total responsibility for myself. However I know that my family is always here for me as far as moral support is concerned and when I am in need of more money!  rrHaHa!  I am really feeling excited about being in Austin because I am closer to my sister in San Antonio and there is a wide variety of people here to interact with. I love to walk down the streets and see everyone, what they are wearing, how they are acting, and all around just what is going on. I consider myself to be someone who is open to people and their different lifestyles. Harlingen, the town that I am from, has the population at UT and it is a rather conservative place. If some of the people in Austin were to go down to Harlingen and walk the streets, they would get stares and be talked about. I love the fact that in Austin all things go. Going to class was somewhat of a nervous experience for me because I did not know what to expect. I found out that it was somewhat like the high school class experience, except for the fact that there were now hundreds of people in my classes. Also, I don't have to go to class if I don't want to. Although I could not see that as a possibility because I feel if I do that, then I will fall behind and lose valuable information. I feel really stressed because things have seemed to be going wrong for me since I got here. I have been misplacing things, tearing apart my room looking for them and then finding them right under my nose. I guess it is because I feel overwhelmed about being here at school. I just need to relax and enjoy this ride. I find it frustrating that parents and other relatives always give me the bad side of college, like, don't walk by yourself at night because you might get raped, don't spend too much money, don't do this and don't do that. Not that that is not valuable and understood but it's all negative. I like it when people are positive with me and say oh it's going to be great, you are going to have so much fun at college, you will learn so many things. My sister and her fiancÃ¯Â¿Â½ came to see me one day and my future brother-in-law made college seem like the best thing in the entire world. He is now a civil engineer and all he could say was that he wished he could come back to college because he enjoyed it so much. He really gave my roommate and me a better and more comfortable sense of being in college, instead of the Oh my gosh, I'm so scared of college and I know I'm going to end up killing myself view that is usually portray by others. Overall I am a mass of mixed emotions and look forward to anything and everything that I will experience here at the University of Texas at Austin. ",1
1512,"     lets begin. how to begin. . this is a start. a start of something undetermined. not like a coefficient. not even a matrix. although its being stored physically in memory in a linear fashin which if you dumped it to a screen it would wrap and may appear as a matrix; not like the movie. just plain ordinary hexadecimal digits; boring to the average person. or at least what i percieve to be average; this is by experience, my experince which is limited. im hingry err hungry. perhaps i just coined a new word. i should copywrite it and charge people a rediculous sum of money whenever its used. id be financially secure. no problems paying tuition in the future. everything would be perfect. well not really, that was sarcasm. what else. . bordom is begining to set in. hmmm what happened today?  well, i went to skewl and learned a few new tricks. no, i am not a dog. or a cat or mouse or flea. i had a dog when i was young though and some fish. never had a pet aligator; though they are common in the sewers in some parts of houston, my hometown. that place is awfull. funny have awe full -- which is used to describe something good -- is so similar to awfull. yadda yadda yadda hocus pocus and a bunch of other filler words go here. the oven is finished preheating. i thought i'd be lazy and eat pizza tonight. unfortunately i have to wait about 13 minutes until i can put it in the oven. if i left the computer now id be cheating wouldn't i?  who am i asking. 1. instructor, 2. teachers assistant, 3. myself, 4. some imaginary diety. hmmm undecided. well no, myself. am i vain?  not often do i think of myself as such but everything is untimately relative to me, i can only imagine what others think and feel and experience. oh well insert more garbage here. is the audience bored yet?  can they tell im bored. prolly so. i forget to tell stephanie that riley called. hopefully ill remember later when she gets home. i think i forget to tell her last time he called to. this is not good because he still needs to resolve some things with here. he is young. im old. getting older, but not as old as dirt. how old is dirt anyways?  will it ever evolve into something else? we'll make great pets. i never went to lalapalooza. sister did, car broke down and so they hitched a ride the rest of the way there. crazy dangerous and fun all at the same time i suppose. i usually play things safe which result in alot of missed opertunities. at least i think so. but this is not as true as it used to be. some of my friends think im a bit strage. sometimes truth is stranger than fiction. bad religion. from the grey race i think. my best friend in high skool was a big fan of them. i fooled around with his girlfriend one night and have regretted it ever since. told him the next day about it. he was glad, he wanted rid of her anyways. funny how things work out sometimes. my grammer is horrible. hagar the horrible wasa comic i read in the newspaper when i was little. hocus focus was my favorite though. i remember easter at my grandmothers and getting stung by a wasp. meat tenderizer in a wonderfull thing. a1 sauce not equals meat tenderizer. i like c. its for cookie and is a bad ass programming language. maybe i spend to much time staring into electron guns. crts have got to be bad for my vision. maybe that why i need contact. laser surgery sounds pretty good. still the long term effects are unknown. whats the worst that could happen?  my eyes fall out of their sockets and i have to put ping pong balls in there instead?  my friends could call me muppet man!  i really do find that amusing. a bit morbid, but amuzing nonetheless. 2 minutes to go until this assignment is done. then i can put the pizza in the oven the wait another 20 minutes til i can eat. please don't feel guiltly for making me wait. humans can go for a few days without food or so i am told. i do not known from experience. still i am hungry. the hunger is a band i never saw play in concert. i did see lucious jackson. that was great fun. i had a shiney dead fish toy that everyone liked. the band kept looking at it while they played on stage with a confused look on their face ",1
1054,"My feet really hurt. I wish I would have made that dance team. if that stupid bitch lina had made it, I wouldn't feel so bad. I have always hated her. She is a stupid fat whore who I hope does not succeed in life and ends up as fat as her mother. Having an abortion and then denying it, what a lying sack. I hate people like that. I want my computer to work all the time. I am so sick of it being messed up all the time. Tracy dropped psychology. Damn. I was hoping we could get to know each other by studying together and going to class together. That would be really nice. I need to meet more people here. I like hanging out with all my old friends, but I need to meet some more. Those dance girls were all airheads though. Maybe it is a good thing that I didn't make it. I would have to around all hose goof ball people all the time. That would kind of suck. Man, I wish I could loose some weight. I am not going to if I keep eating all this shitty dorm food. With as much as I work out, I should be loosing weight. Why not. Mark wants to loose weight just as much as I do, but I guess it is just as hard for guys to loose weight as it is for girls. Whatever. I am already tired of this assignment. I guess it is better that having some tight ass paper to write. My rhetoric response paper sucked. I hope I get a good grade on it though. I have to make good grades this year. I will die if I don't. I want to, and my parents will kill me if I don't. not enough time for sex though. I guess when you first start having sex you want to do it all the time. Too bad mark doesn't want to. I wish he was just a little bit more of a horn ball. What a weird thing to say. I girl wanting a guy to be a little bit more horny. Isn't it supposed to be the other way around? Whatever. I really want to have sex now. Look what I d id to myself. That girl on the south mall was really weird. There are no hot guys in any of my classes. Well at least that I can see. I can't see anyone in my huge ass classes 200540 people. What bullshit! This is such a huge school. It's ridiculous. My hands hurt because I am typing so fast and so much. Whatever. Need to pop my knuckles. There. I can't believe that Ken Reynolds died that is crazy 42 years old. That really scares me. If matt calls in the middle of the night one more time, I think I am going to throw the computer at the wall. I love this song ""falling from grace"" It is awesome. It makes me think of a movie. I'm not sure which one though. Maybe some drug movie or something. All that reading I have to do. College is way harder than I am wanting right now. I need more time for friends, sex, fun all that stuff. I think tomorrow after Mark comes over we will sleep for a while and then maybe we will mess around. I don't know. We always do if we are alone in bed for any period of time. I am so excited about the football game. I get to sit with who. let's see. Lindsey, Mark, and Ian, is that it? I can't even remember. Oh yeah wes did not have a sports package, and david did not give them his id. Man my neck hurts. I need another massage. That felt so good. I can't believe that Lindsey has Natalie in her Rhetoric class. I hope I get a good grade on my rhetoric response paper. I need to start off with good grades and then try to keep them up rather than start off with bad grades and then try to get them up. This is really not that bad of an assignment. I can handle it pretty well. I wonder who is on the phone. It must be Ian. What a weird kid. He is cool though. I am glad to have him as a friend. I wish Wes would be a little more open when I try to talk to him. He is nice and I think he likes me fine, but he just always acts strange around me like he is uncomfortable. except when we are drunk. Then we are like old friends. Who knows about that boy. He has a complex mind. It was nice of him to say that he would be my assistant editor any time. I'd be his for sure. He was drunk when he said that though. I hope he meant. Most people say that you say the truth when you are drunk, but some people think that you make stuff up when you are drunk. I don't, but I know some people do. I just want to have some new friends. I think I am going to friends with tracy she is nice and every time I see her, we talk for a while. Today, she said they were having a gijoe barbie party tomorrow night. All the girls come as barbie and all the guys come as gijoe. That sounds like fun. I kind of wish I was in a sorority, but I guess I will live. Oh well. There's twenty minutes. ",1
1793,"Does this writing assignment have to be in essay format? This whole electronic assignment is very new to me and I have no clue what i should do! I'm guessing this is kind of a journal type thing. As I'm typing, my fingers are shaking. The whole day has been very nerve wrecking because i feel so stupid in class! College is a completely different world and I honestly don't know how well i will do! Do i have to capitalize my   I's  ? I type much faster if I don't. so many things are going through my mind, like what should i write about? what should i wear to the party tonight? am i even going the party? i wonder if there will be any cute guys there. This 20 minute period is going by very slow. i keep making typing errors because i am trying to type fast, but my hands are shaking! my foot is numb! i am so paranoid! am i even doing this assignment right? im trying not to stop too much, but i keep making errors that i have to go back and fix. why am i shaking? my sister's wedding is on saturday, i wonder if its going to turn out right. she's been taking on all of the responsibilities such as flower arrangements, restaurant decorations, etc. i offered to help, but she declined. oh my goodness! its only been 7 minutes?! what else am i supposed to write? i remember doing something like this in AP Language. Mendrop made us go outside somewhere and type what we felt or things we observed in nature and relate somehow. i hope this is a similar assignment, if not then i am doing this completely WRONG! im very sleepy because i haven't gotten much sleep since school started, yesterday. i only got four hours of sleep on tuesday night and then seven hours last night. i'm pretty sure im not going to get much sleep over the weekend becasue its my sister's wedding and i have to help as much as possible. im only half way through with the assignment. i think im running out of thoughts. my classes really make me nervous. i felt so stupid in calculus today. i knew all of the questions he asked, but it took me twice as long as everyone else to answer! i don't think i made a very good impression on buskirk either. falling asleep on the first day of school and not following directions correctly the next doesn't actually give the professor a very good first impression. why can't i make friends with people? i don't think im very social unless people talk to me first. i'm getting very sleepy. my eyes are drooping as i type. will i get an incompletion grade for this assignment because i dotn kno if im doing this correctly. i am really taking this assignment seriously! my fingers and knees are shaking, but i think mostly because im so pooped. i miss home a little. i miss not having so many responsibilities like paying bills, college, etc. the professors i have are actually nicer than i expected, but then its also only the second day of school. i don't kno how much high school prepared me for college becasue i don't really know what to expect anymore. all of these online registrations to get your grades, do your homework, etc. is very confusing. i am trying to keep up in every class, but its so hard to becasue the class is so big. every day, i think,   what am i supposed to do now?   i try really hard to make good grades and all, but it doesn't feel like its enough. i think im actually a good student, but im a visual learner. im trying to think of what to say next, but nothing in particular is on my mind. i see things infront of me, but i have no thoughts about it. Britney spears is a great dancer, but she's got a wierd voice. i think the american idol should be kelly clarkson. she's a great singer. i wish i was that talented. i wish i was a genious who was pretty and talented, but instead im more of a moderately intelligent average looking girl who tries too hard. i feel like a loser. time is almost up. i didnt' realize how hard it was to keep track of my thoughts. i think its hard because when im thinking, its just a continuous flow, but when i have to actually pay attention to what im thinking, then i feel forced to think of something. its kind of like when someone asks you to sing. you can sing to yourself anytime, but when you are forced to sing, its like you don't know what to sing and you get nervous. i don't think i wrote much for twenty minutes. i did have to pause a couple of times though so i can remember everything i was thinking. it feels so much easier now, but i still don't kno if i got the assignment right. do you deduct points for punctuation, grammar, capitalization, etc. ?

1034,"Sometimes I think of what other people are thinking. I watch the way people stare or the way they look at the ground when they walk. They must be thinking about things that they have to do or even things that they have just finished doing. I don't understand how we can have thoughts that are so evident in your mind, but completely shut out from anyone else's knowledge. I feel strange in the fact that I am putting my thoughts into words. Though I am concentrating on writing, I am also able to let my mind wander while I write. The way I think and the way I process my thoughts has changed since I've been in college. Leaving home so early forced me to grow up, which I desperately needed, and it also made me understand all the things that I have at home. My life in Austin is good, but it is missing all those people that I made such a major part of my life. I wonder if those people will ever be there again. My family, of course, will always be there, but the others might not. My friends and my boyfriend are the ones that I spent ever spare moment with. Now that I am in a completely different city, my spare moments are spent thinking of them. I always travel back in time, in my head, to the days I spent with them. Every weekend, after school, and on vacations are the times I had with them. Maybe they are thinking the same way. I can't help but remember those days that we just did nothing productive. Those were the easiest and funnest times of my life. My mother always told me that college is the funnest time, but I have yet to see what she is talking about. My mother is great. Now I realize all the things she has done for me. She was always there for me, and even now that I am hundreds of miles away, she still there. I was distracted by the distant voices behind me. They seem to be discussing a project. Some kind of stress has been put on this group. I am assuming that they have procrastinated their work and are now hurrying to finish it. Stress is one thing that I cannot deal with. When I stress I start to think a lot. When I think, I get really nostalgic, and eventually get very sad that I no longer can do the things I used to do in the past. Some people beside me are also using the computer. Their minds seem to be captured by their work, and they seem so occupied that they would never even notice that I am writing about them. If I were to turn my head and watch them for a second, they wouldn't notice that either. I can always feel someone looking at me. Even if it was only a slight glance, through the corner of my eyes I can see someone look. Even when I don't see them, the weight of their stare causes my awareness of it. After this writing assignment is finished, I have to drive through Austin's traffic to get home. That is the only thing I can't stand about going home. What should only take five minutes, ends up being a half an hour drive. Things like that frustrate me. The light rail system is supposed to fix that traffic problem. I have a feeling that Austin is going to be just like Houston, and now matter what type of construction is done, the traffic is never going to be fixed. It is difficult to try to find a quick, easy and inexpensive way to ease the congestion in the city. Pretty soon, people are going to be so sick of it that they will move out into the country. After that, the county will start to get overpopulated and the cycle will start again. ",1
2286,"Well where should I start. First of all this has got to be one of the strangest writing assignments that I have ever had to do. I'm not even sure what to write about. My day started at 6:30 today because I have an 8 o'clock class which is really fun. not as fun as this class but fun non-the-less. then I went to my medical terminology class which could be more fun but its hard to make a class that is based on memorization fun. then I had a break from 10 to 3:30 which would really suck if I didn't have plans. so after my class I went to jester then met up with a friend of mine an signed up for a I'm flag football team. well anyway, I'm not even sure if I'm doing this assignment right because all I am doing is describing what I did today. any way I really enjoyed today's material in class. at first I wasn't sure if I would like the class but now I really believe that it might be my favorite class right now. Considering that I have and extremely hot instructor for my RHE 306 class. Its crazy hot attractive she is. But now I'm thinking about another girl that I have a crush on. Today she invited me over to her apartment to have some burgers with her and her roommates. I'm not sure if she knows how I feel, but I'm having a hard time reading her. Usually I'm pretty good about being able to tell if a girl is feeling me but she seems to be different which doesn't make things any easier. I also got to talk to my roommates about things that had been on my mind which was refreshing because I had been wanting to talk to them for a while. Things seem to be really good between us which isn't too surprising because we're all pretty decent guys, though one does tend to get to us sometimes. I am going blank right now but hopefully something will come to mind. On yeah, I got to talk to my parents today which wasn't too bad. My dad didn't say much because he had football practice but he said that the team was coming around which is always good to hear because he puts a lot of effort and time into his work. My mom called on her way to a Bible study and said that she would be sending a few things with the girl I have crush on this weekend since she is going home Friday. anyway crush is such a high school word now, what I really meant was girl I'm attracted to. What's really funny is that this is the girl that my mom has been wanting me to get with since I was in 10th grade. and every time she would tell me I would brush it off knowing that the girl was attracted to me but now that I'm into her it kind of sucks because now I have to put much more effort into it. Now don't get me wrong, because I'm not trying to make it seem like I'm am lazy but I truly am not used to putting in so much work. I know it may sound cockeye but if it does I'm sorry, please don't think of me like that. what's even funnier is that who ever reads this may not even get to meet more or me meet them but any way its been about twenty minutes so we'll talk later, or I'll type and you'll read later.

1731,"Today is September 11th. It's kind of strange. Everyone is hurring to get to parades and festivities to remember this significant tragic event. Where am I?  I am in a friend's dorm doing a writing assignment for professor Pennebaker. This is kind of hard because I have no idea what else to write. September 11th is just the number one thing on many people's mind right now, since it is 9/11. I really don't know how to feel. I'm saddened of course, but a little tired of all the   ground zero   footage. It it's so sad, why do they keep airing it over and over and over and over again?  It makes me more sad to watch it. I haven't been able to watch T. V. all afternoon because of it. I don't know what else to write. I wonder how i'm going to get this stain off of my white star wars T-shirt. I was trying to unwrap a passion fruit starburst with my mouth only, and it sliped out of my mouth. Weird. My roomate and I tried to see who could unwrap it the fasted. It was sort of a tie, because neither of use could get the wrapper off. I wonder if they lit the tower up yet. It's supposed to be red, white and blue tonight. My foot kind of itches from a mosquito bite i recieved earlier today. I need to put something cold on it. I don't like Britney Spears too much. Her music is kind of weak. She has nice shoes though. I guess she couldn't be all that bad since millions of people mindlessly buy her records and posters like my friend who has it religiously taged up on his wall. He, like every other teenage boy ranging from the ages 13-18 adores her. She's not that bad. Oh man, I've only been typing for nine minutes and 14 seconds and I can't think of anything else to write. This is the longest 20 minutes of my life. We used to free write like this in a rhetoric class I was taking at my highschool. I was taking it for dual credit with a local university. We used to write for 10 minutes strait without stopping. My teacher was a nice 50 year old woman who sounded like a 90 year old. Her voice was so soothing, sometimes. I hear this whisling or hissing sound coming from the bathroom down the hall and a couple of guys laughing outside the door. I can't stop writing. Let's see, what to write about. I think I'll write about my day. Today I was late for Chemistry. again. Our teacher is this French woman who has the thickest accent. She's sweet though. After that I headed back to Jester West to grab a Freshen's smoothie. I got strawberry shooter. It was pretty good. A little icy. This guy behind me asked what i recomended, and I said the pina colider or the the passion fruit. I like passion fruit, but not as much as I like pineapple. I didn't really enjoy the strawberry shooter because it had to many seeds in it. After that i headed to my History of Rock and Roll class. I love that class. All we do really is read and listen to blues, jazz and Tin Pan Alley music. It's really fun. I came home at about 1:00 from class and fell right asleep, them watched queen of the damned. That movie has a good sound track to it. Some of the songs that were in the movie were not in the sound track. That was weird. Wow,only three minutes to go. It kind of seemed interminable at the beginning, but now it's not that hard. I guess it's easier to just think rather than to think about what you're thinking. What is that called?  Oh, yeah. metacognition. I learned that in my rhetoric class also. THinking about your thinking. Only 30seconds left. I guess I'll write my name for the remaining time. Wait there is no time.

1055,"Okay, here we go. I am going to type continuously for 20 minutes. I don't know how I can do this considering that I type pretty fast and also I am in the UGL and the keys are making quite a loud clicky noise with each letter that I type. Oh well, no one seems to be listening. I am really tired right now and all I can think about is sleeping soundly in my comfortable bed. drifting into a relaxing deep sleep. IT'S ONLY BEEN ONE MINUTE! I can't do this for that long. I have nothing interesting on my mind. hmmmmm I had a fun time last night. I got in at 6 in the morning. IF only my mother could see me now. that's the latest I've ever gotten in. am I typing loud? I don't want to do this anymore. I am very nervous about people looking over my shoulder right now at this very instant reading at the ridiculous things that I am typing. bored bored bored bored. I miss my friend jennifer a lot. we talked earlier this week and she said she would call me back. but she never did. today in Barnes and noble I was by myself looking at books and saw one that reminded me of jennifer and I really felt like bursting out in tears right there in the middle of that bookstore. somehow I held it back. hell right now I want to cry. I really miss all of my Dallas friends like so much. we've been through everything together and it's like we're drifting apart. I guess it's inevitable, though. I mean I've seen it a thousand times in films: the classic high school seniors move away to college scenario. but I never thought that it really would be this hard. I'm living on my own. I am my own mother now. That's pretty damn scary! I think I'm responsible though. I've always been able to manage my time wisely. Even my mom agrees with that. IT'S ONLY BEEN 3 MINUTES. or 4 maybe. I really like this guy I met. like really. it's just something about him. and it's so disenchanting that he's playing hard to get with me. I'm a very sensitive person with not a lot of dating experience, so games are not my idea of fun. I hope he's not looking over my shoulder right now. I'm really paranoid right now. I don't want him to see that I'm writing about him for this. god, if he saw this he would freak out. he probably thinks I'm stalking him anyway. I'm really not. I think I am inventing things in my head. I do that a lot. I can't believe I'm writing all this out for this assignment. oh well, this is probably not even going to be read by anyone. Well, hopefully not. I mean this is pretty boring stuff, teenager's brains. YIKES! so okay it's given that this will not be read. at least I am assuming that it is. So, with that in mind I really am open to write whatever the hell I want to write. This is for my benefit, in essence. Like a diary entry that you turn in for a grade. Not typical, but hey it happens. oh god! I really like that guy. I hope he shares something like that about me. he said he'll call me tomorrow. maybe. he did say maybe. then he said maybe Tuesday. Hell, I'm sick of waiting around for this guy. I always do this. I cling on so fast to people I'm interested in even after just meeting them. It's like I have a onetrack mind and it's all I can think about. That's pretty scary, huh? Wow I just scrolled up and I've written a lot. A lot of really boring stuff too. He probably won't call tomorrow. Who am I kidding? I can't keep doing this to myself. It's really unhealthy. I just want to cry after realizing this. It's such a horrible thing. I am putting this guy up on a pedestal  is that how you spell it?  and like if he messes up just a little bit, then I think that he hates me and I'm just this horrible person. God I say the stupidest things around him sometimes. I'm so concerned with trying to impress him that I just end up saying stupid things. that he won't even remember, but I am again blowing it out of proportion. Who am I kidding, I need to get my mind off this guy. but grrrrr! everyone now compared to him just doesn't seem to measure up. Like everyone I meet, I hold off on just for that rare chance that I might get to date this guy. I am a weird person. I am still paranoid about people looking over my shoulder. It feels like the whole world is scrutinizing me. Whoa that's scary. I love embellishing in my selfpity. it's so encouraging. NOT REALLY. wow the whole lab is completely silent except for my really loud typing. I feel like each letter I type is a clap of thunder booming and echoing into the distance. time is like momentarily slowed down and every thunder clasp is loudly emphasized. Wow, my 20 minutes are almost up. How did that go so fast? What did I write about? I can't even remember. I really don't want to look back at what I wrote either because I'm sure it's just the same thing over and over again. but I'm sure I will look back at it in just a second. well, if anyone is reading this, I envy your patience. until next time. That is all. ",1
1606,"    Its hard to start anywhere I guess I feel like I'm being analyzed   for what I'm writing, but I know that it doesnt mean anything, that   twenty minutes of writing can't really say everything about me. class   somewhat worries me, I know I've taken 7 some odd AP classes yet   i still don't feel like i'm prepared, i just have to stay focused, i hope   that doesnt bother taylor to much but he's just going to have to learn   that it takes me a while to study and that has to come first. Its a sad   thought really, that studying has to ever come first in life, isnt all you'll   ever know what you truly experience, won't you only find happiness in   yourself and other people? so why study so much on things that   tend to affect you so little, why don't we interact more, shouldnt we be   put into groups of people with different backgrounds and cultures,   learn understanding and acceptance, that would save more   problems. The worst battles are those that come out of ignorance,   and people learn how to float the system of books and test, but it   would be harder to ignore real human interaction, there seems to be   so much misunderstanding in the world simply because people   don't interact and learn who's really out there, so much of humanitys   misery could be qualmed if only people spent time physically   interacting with humanity. Its easier to disregard a text than it is to   disregard a human. but i suppose not very many people see it that   way. I wonder if this is where im supposed to be or if there is some   greater plan out there for me, i wish i knew, but i guess thats life, the   suprise of the future, the unknow of the big picture, everyone goes   through it I suppose i just have to as well. I'm tired of pouring out my   thoughts to a page, i want to talk to people, people who think like   me, i think Maya Angelou is the most amazing person ever, her   attitude toward people is superfluous with love. she just is the most   beautifully person inside and out, she is a role model for the way to   look and society and people, i hope to gain a lot of the knowledge   that she has. I'll just keep reading her books, i need to check out the   library and see what else they have, too bad i never have time to   read what i want to and what really enhances my life because im   stuck reading textbooks for hours. I hope i get to join the crew team it   will be really exciting if im actually around athletic people, maybe it   will get me off my butt, lord knows i need to. oh well, 15 minutes   done, gosh that flew by, it was a nice writing assignment, i wish we   could have more like that. This   open your door    thing next week is   going to fabulous im exciting about people stopping by and meeting   everyone on our floor. i swear that the strangest thing, its the second   time I've switched the words our and hour, and not in the same way   either, very odd. tonights going to fun watching the football game, i   hope taylor enjoys himself tonight, it makes me so mad when hes   upset about social surroundings, oh well he'll learn. i guess i have   to get ready soon to go watch the game, i seem to always be   running behind, i'll catch up soon enough, i hope my package from   apple computer comes soon, im excited about my new adaptor silly   really to get excited but what the hey, might as well enjoy life ",0
2008,"okay so I'm sitting here in the computer lab in simkins dormitory     hall, realizing that I cannot type very well. how embarrassing to keep     deleting. it is so hot in here and I hate macintosh comps. I wish I     had a laptop in my room. I wish I had money. my roommate brought a     computer, and a tv. I feel like the poor one in the room. I actually     decided to do this assignment now because my roommate has two     guests over right now. they are two very nice girls but I just wanted to     get away. I just barely got back from houston at about 10 and I need     some alone time. what a weekend I had. my friends tiffany, and     diana and I went to these auditions saturday for a winter guard called     emblem281. a very renounced performance group. anyway, it is a very     fun group a kids and I was really excited about the audition. I first     and foremost am a dancer. since the audition consisted of dancing     and flag work I excelled in the dance portion. my flag work was not bad     either. don't you hate when you want something and everybody says,     oh you're going to make it"". and then you don't? that's right, tiffany and     diana made it and not me. it is because I don't spin rifle and I know     the instructor wanted a male rifle line. it is pretty sad. I really wanted     to be in this group that just has so much fun together. but what     really hurt the most is the fact that I feel I fail at everything I go for in     life. let's start at the beginning of my senior year in high school. I     tried out for drum major and was told I'd make it no questions asked. I made it to area auditions on my french horn and was told I'd make     the all-state band no questions asked. I wanted to be section leader     for marching season and ended up not as the president but the vice. came to college didn't make the ballet class for my major, don't have     a spot on the field for the band's chicago show this coming game,     and didn't make it into emblem. wow. I feel a lot better. it just sucks to     be me right now. but I always pull through with God's help. or do I     just get over it? my hair is starting to itch. I think I should shower     tonite instead of tomorrow morning. I wonder why do we itch. what is     the explanation of an itch. are the nerves freaking out and by     scratching does that friction calm the nerves back down? I think     about the reason things happen often. like why do our joints make     the cracking sound? something about the releasing of air or     something. I forget. I must go to sleep soon. I have to get up for     dance class at 8. yeah tell me about it. my mom bought me all these     groceries so I don't have to worry about walking across campus to     eat all the time. I love her so much. even though money is tight, she     always makes a way for me. I will never forget the strings we had to     pull for my high school prom. okay time has expired. this little     assignment makes me feel I should get a journal. I just hope I have     done this right. Ii aiming for an 'a' in the class!        ",1
2314,"I am watching mtv cribs with Chris Pontius. Today was hot and I'm supposed to go running with Nathan but it's still too hot so I want to go later. Maybe I'll get some of my work done before then so I won't stay up so late like I have been lately. I'm really tired so I took a nap today and slept like a rock. I don't know when I'm going to supper though because I don't want to eat before I work out or I'll feel sick so I might just get Nathan to cook for me tonight. I am starting to miss everyone from back home because I'm not usually away from my family, friends, and Sam for this long. I guess I will just have to wait a couple more days to go home for labor day weekend. I want to go home to see everyone but I really don't want to go to the football game and that's what all of my friends are going to want to do. I'm running out of things to think about because the TV is on and it's distracting me. The song on this commercial is going to be in my head now for the rest of the day. I like all my classes so far but I'm still kind of scared. Especially about biology because my prof is going really quickly over the information and it's hard to stay up with him. I'm getting tired looking at this computer screen. my eyes are getting droopy but I can't get tired and go to sleep now because then I won't get anything done and I won't be able to sleep well tonight. just like last night I couldn't fall asleep forever and then when I finally fell asleep I kept waking up so I felt like I didn't sleep at all. my strawberry smoothie was really good just now. I'm kind of hungry but lately I haven't felt that good so I don't feel like eating. Maybe ill just wait until later when my roommate wants to go so I'll have someone to sit with. I hate going to the cafeteria without knowing someone because then I sit with people I don't know and we're always eating so we can't really talk with food in our mouth but I want to meet them and not be rude. I'm sure they understand because here at hardin house all the girls are really sweet. they are all in sororities though and me and my roommate Madison are they only 2% not in one. oh well I have way too much school work and other stuff to do and I know if I would have rushed I wouldn't have time for anything else and I really need to do good this first semester and get it behind me and get used to everything. My back has been hurting a lot lately because of an injury from track season but I can't get into a back specialist for a while so I kind of just have to live with it. and I love to exercise but it hurts me for days afterwards. I decided that I'm just going to start working out and if it hurts oh well because I really don't want to gain the freshman fifteen. ha. my boyfriend goes to school in Lubbock at Texas tech and it feels so different not being able to see each other everyday like we used to. it seems like we fight every day no matter what and yesterday was our one year anniversary so I went and got him a present Saturday with my mom at the mall in san Antonio. she wanted me to go back to Hondo with her just for the weekend because her and my dad missed me but I wanted to come back up here for the weekend and party with some of my friends. my parents got to see my yesterday though. they came up after lunch with my grandparents and they brought even more stuff for my dorm room. my mom has been keeping herself busy at home by being creative and making cute things to decorate with but I really enjoy when she brings me stuff. we went to eat at hula hut on lake Austin and it was really good like seafood/Mexican food. I've never had a shrimp enchilada before then but it was great and my dad ordered an awesome dessert tray that we all shared and loved. then we went out on the deck and watch all the people on the lake and just talked for a while.

508,"Although overall, I am having the time of my life, finally being away from home and family and finally free from parental restrictions, it's not all fun. I'm actually on my own. I can't believe it - for the first time, I won't have my parents to rely on everything for. I'll have to take on so much more responsibility for myself. And I think I'm prepared for it too, which is a very good feeling. Even though I've made soo many new friends (and some enemies), it's not the same anymore. I don't know if that's good or bad, but it's just different. I still would've preferred going to the college I wanted to go to, Columbia U. I guess I'm still angry at my parents for not letting me go out of state. oh well, I'll just have to accept it. Right now it's late, almost midnight. I am tired and I have so much to say right now but I just can't get it all out. most of what I think about nowadays is what my future will be like and what I actually want to pursue in my education. Do I really have the commitment to study medicine? What am I going to major in? I'm just full of doubts about myself sometimes. A lot of my motivation comes from my desire to just be successful and happy in life. Right now my parents are preparing for their trip to India. They haven't been there in 2 years. I feel so distant and alienated from my relatives over there. Somehow I feel my parents' families resent me because I was actually born in America. Also, I don't really feel ""indian. "" I am American in the full sense of the word. That's been a huge conflict I've had with myself -- my ethnic identity. The indian community I have lived with tends to separate itself from other cultures, an idea which I dislike. So I find my self associating more with people of other races, which is terrific for me. However, I find myself separated often from people of my own heritage because I act different. I don't always hang out with Indian people. In fact, I rarely do. Strangely, it's a good feeling, knowing that my identity was developed by ME, not by the culture of some country my parents happened to live in less than half their lives. I don't know why I can be so bitter about this subject. I guess I just resent the idea of the Indian culture trying to shape my life. I am about ME, not about being Indian. Ok now that I'm getting into this stream of consciousness thing, I'm going to complain about something else. How about religion? I am very proud of the fact that I am a christian. However, my parents don't seem to believe I am religious because I do not shout and jump and down and speak in tongues and faint at church services. I am more of a reserved person, and my parents don't seem to recognize that. It's the same way with the Indian church I used to go to. I left that church because basically everyone there was a hypocrite. Church, to them and especially for my dad, was something to make themselves look good. As long as they pretend they were holy and righteous, they were in good standing with the indian community. I couldn't stand it so I left for a better church. Spiritually I am thriving and growing with christ, and it's been such a blessing for me. Right now, my roommate is out partying and I'm stuck in my room sick and my legs hurt. funny, I don't really feel lonely. I actually like being by myself. With others sometimes I feel like I have to act like I'm someone else. Alone, I can actually be myself. my hands hurt and they are tired now, but I feel like typing more. I wonder if people think I'm some kind of nerd or recluse. I hate when people assume that about me since I'm not a party person and I do well in school. I really am different from most people, and I like that about me. When I get married and have kids (IF I even want to have kids), that's something important I want to teach them -- to develop themselves as individuals, not part of a group. That's what the problem is today with gangs or other kinds of cliques. people feel such a great need to belong to something or a group. not me. and I don't care what other people think. maybe I'm too proud of myself. who knows. if someone were to read this, they'd think I have no friends or something. nothing can be farther from the truth. I really do have a lot of friends. basically I look for some shred of intellect and personality in a person I want to befriend. So as I'm winding down writing all the thoughts that my brain is oozing out, I have to express a couple feelings. I'm excited about my new beginning in life at UT. I'm still pretty apprehensive about my future and what my goals actually are. I know I am competent and capable of doing anything. before this starts to sound really gay, I think I must end this. ok no I wont, haha! I still have a little more to say. I am a night person. I don't know why. but I just love being awake at night, not in the daytime. it's so peaceful and quiet. it's a strange feeling knowing you're awake and alive and you are so energized while everyone else is sleeping. I feel like I can do things I couldn't do in the daytime because everyone would see me. I wonder what people think when they see me. are they repulsed by me or what? I know I'm not the most attractive person in the world, and that's a fact. I wonder how much less people think of me because I am fat. I am really trying to lose the excess pounds though. don't get me wrong -- I'm not dieting because of what other people think. I KNOW it's not healthy for me, and believe me, I intend to live a long healthy life, and I need to start. sometimes I feel I am less of a person because of my physical imperfections. I don't intend to be a statistic of the ""freshman 15. "" well, with all that said, I am ending this now. ",1
56,"Well, here goes nothing. I decided to do this assignment while waiting for class. I arrived at 3, class starts at 3:30,my bad. Guess I'll just transfer it to computer later. This hallway isn't particularly quiet. The door next to me squeaks. Not like a mouse mind you, but that annoying oil-me-sound. This hallway looks different than all the others. I don't know why that is exactly, it just does. I don't seem to be having that many creative thoughts. My suite-mate told me that you become most creative during the late hours like 2 and 3a. m. I guess this is my creative down-time. Boy, I could sure use a little down-time. Too many things still left to do. Somewhere in here I have to eat dinner. I refuse to eat from the death carts again today. Granted, they do have good eggrolls. But I just don't want figure out what the meat is. Dog would be very bad. I've got a dog, or at least I had a dog. I had to leave him at home. I guess I'll see him at Christmas. I like it how the semester ends at Christmas. Less to worry about over the holidays. Unlike high school. I hated it when teachers would have tests right after long vacations. Not that I did bad on them. It just meant I had to think about the upcoming test for the duration of break. Y'know, it's going to be hard to type all this one-handed. I fractured my finger about a week before class. For the time being my finger is immobilized. You'd be surprised at all the times we use our pinky and take it for granted. It is a very essential finger. Only 5 more weeks or so, and it will be healed. Personally, I can't wait. I've really had an interesting time as a new student. Adapt to college and adapt to the loss of complete hand movement. Which is essentially the loss of my left hand. I wonder how long this is typed. It's 2 pages written. OUCH#@** My leg is asleep. Pins & needles are always a fun sensation. I wonder how much longer it will be till class. Almost there I think. I feel good that I actually completed a paper weeks before the deadline. It's not a first, but it's close. I've decided one thing about UT, TEX hates me. He asked me if I wanted him to search for one of my classes, and of course I said yes. So TEX replied that my class had been added from 7-9. No problem, right?  He neglected to mention p. m. I am no longer enrolled in anthropology. GOOD-BYE AND GOOD LUCK. ",0
2032,"Well, here I am writing my paper for psychology. There is so much noise here. Everyone has their stereos on full blast. It's a good thing I have mine. I need to change the song. So many songs that I skipped. It is okay. I found one that I want to listen to. This is a really good song. It is called Judith"" from A Perfect Circle. Their new album was strange. It sounded like a different band, so calm and mellow. I like it anyways because it calms me down. I don't know what I would do with out music. It is so essential to me. I believe that it is my sanity. If I didn't have my music I would go insane. So many feelings and thoughts in the lyrics. I am amazed that someone is willing to reflect on their lives or any given moment and come up with such inspiring. I can't think of the other word I was going to say. I hope I do well in my classes. I am really getting used to this thing called ""college life. ""  I feel at home and myself here in Austin. I've been waiting for a day like this. I still miss my family though, but I am strong. There goes two minutes off my time. My mom called and I had to explain to her something. I sometimes feel confused about who I really am. There are always moments in my life where I take a moment to reflect on myself and existence. I wonder how we did come about existing. So many explanations and theories, it is hard to believe them. I would rather come up with my own explanation. It is hard to, but I still have until the day I die to come up with an answer. I can't believe that two years have past since my uncle died. I will never forget that day. I really never experienced a death in the family. It really changed my outlook on life. I know wherever he is, he is looking over me and seeing how much I have accomplished. So many obstacles in my life and I managed to knock them over to get where I wanted to go. I wonder where I am going to end up in life. This journey is long and treturous. I need to tread with caution. So many threats in the world now a days. What drives the human race to act the way they do. So ignorant and destructive. As long as I just focus on my life and not that of others, I will be fine. It has got me this far. Life is so wondrous and worth living. Twenty one. the beginning of our end. ",1
1953,"Well, I'm sitting here writing this. Not much is going on right now. I was playing free cell on my computer before. Yeah, I was that bored. Wow, this is what college is like. My roommate is sleeping right now. That's all she ever really does. Sleep and eat. speaking of eating I'm kinda hungry even though I had boba tea and a spring roll like at about 11. I really need to stop these late night temptations! yeah I really don't want to gain the freshman 15 as they call it. I want to go home this weekend but I really shouldn't. I have a lot of crap to study for. I want to go home to see my grandma and my dog. I'm not using very good grammar or punctuation in this assignment. I hope whoever reads it does not think I'm a complete moron I'm just lazy! yeah my laziness often gets in the way of things oh well. that is life. now I'm not thinking about anything much. I wonder if we are going to have one of those random pop quizzes in bio tomorrow. I hope not. I didn't do much today partially because I went to eckards to buy myself some cold medicine and orange juice!  I believe in my vitamins. hhahaha ok no!  that was retarded. I think I'm getting sick. ARRGH  I hate getting sick because it always lasts for a while and now I can't miss classes. damn college. I don't know how people who miss class do it. I would always be scared that there would be some sort of pop quiz or the professor going over some random things that will be on a test. like I say GRR to college. I kinda miss high school now that I'm not there. I hate the way time just moves on and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it. I was thinking about that today and there isn't much time till I'm 20! only like 2 years. I never imagined myself even being 18. I guess I don't realize how much I have really changed. Not many people realize whenever they change kinda like you don't really realize whenever u change physically. Grr sorry. I accidentally pressed the finish key but I was not finished since there were like 6 minutes still left so I'm going to continue blabbing for 6 minutes. its only fair. I really do wonder what the hell my life is going to be like in 10 years. It seems that then everything is going to change. Coming out of high school whenever I think about it not much has changed. well the people that I see have changed and my surrounding has changed a bit but I still talk to my best friends. My room mate has been my friend since middle school. I hope that living together won't interfere with our friendship since everyone has those horror stories where they shared a dorm room with their best friend and then they become enemies. I don't think that will happen to us. at least I really hope not. I really do hope that I will soon get over him. this is kinda random but I think about him a lot. I don't even know what is so great about him. nothing really. I guess I still like the person he used to be. USED TO BE is the key word. oh well. I will get over him. Anyways. my continued 6 minutes are about to be up. I hope my blabering was not too stupid and mindless. Oh well! bye bye    ",1
1189,"Right now I'm sitting here at the computer wondering what I'm going to type for the next 20 minutes. There is someone outside in the apartment complex fumbling with their keys, perhaps trying to open their door. My computer is making some noise, and the apartment is really quiet so it seems very loud. I keep on making typing errors which is getting very annoying! There is a lot of stuff on my desk, I need to clear it off. I also need to clean up the kitchen cause there are lots of dishes that were left there last night when a couple of my friends came over last night. I forgot to get batteries for my walkman at the store yesterday too. I need to study for chemistry because I have a quiz in there at 12:30. I tried to last night, but I kept on getting distracted. I don't feel like doing this right now. I want to go to sleep. I just got back from calculus, which was an 8:00 class, and all I want to do is sleep. By the time I get the chance to, it will be time to leave again. I can't think of anything to type. I want to light a candle. I have a lot of time left and I still need to write. I'm not sure what about though. This weekend I'm not sure what I'm going to do, but I guess I'll have fun. I did last weekend. I need to do some reading for my classes, and I can't wait until this day is over because my weekend can begin due to the fact that I don't have any classes on Friday. Right now I am thinking about different things we can plan for my best friend's surprise birthday in Houston. We plan to have a party here for her too, but the one in Houston will be a surprise because she has no idea that me and Dag are planning it. Next weekend I am going to the UT Houston game and then right after that I plan on going home because the 24th is my Dad's birthday and the 21st is my brother's birthday. That will be a busy weekend. The following one is my friend's birthday. My computer is still making some annoying noise. I can't think of anything to type. I have 10 minutes left of typing. Hopefully I can come up with something for these remaining 10 minutes. I'm glad my apartment is on the 2nd floor because I noticed that yesterday when it rained that one of the apartments on the floor below had a puddle of water right in front of the door. That would be very annoying to deal with, if I lived there! So I'm glad I don't. Yesterday there was a lot of traffic. Today I get out of school at 3:30 and I have a trig review class at 5:30. I wish I didn't have to go, but I get extra credit for my calculus class, which I figure I will need. I need to balance my checkbook. I think I'll do that when I finish typing this. I'm going to listen to some CD's when I finish this too. I don't feel like studying, and I guess I'll have to figure out what to have for lunch. I wonder if the water filter we got makes the water taste different, I'll have to check that out in a minute. My desk is really cluttered, I need to get some envelopes and stamps, and mail those thank you letters that I keep on forgetting about. Well, I have a lot more stuff to do than I thought! It's driving me crazy that I keep on making so many typos, I never have this problem. Wow, I've finally written enough to start scrolling on the page! That's kind a cool. I thought that a I would have written more in 20 minutes though. I guess not. Surprisingly the time went by very quickly, I didn't think that it would. I guess in a minute I will log on so that I can get on to the psychology website and send this in. ",1
482,"They are playing the Atlanta Braves. They're good but I think we should be able to defeat them in the playoffs. There closing pitcher, something like, Lightenburg is the ugliest guy in the league: pretty close to Randy Johnson of the Astros. I'm really hungry right now. I want a nice juicy ribeye steak back in Houston. Houston has the best restaurants. The night before I came to school I went to anthony's in houston. I had duck with cherry dressing. It was so good and the dessert was even better. We ordered practically everything on the menu. School is really different from high school. There is so much freedom compared to high school. Not only are parents out of the scene but teachers don't know if you show up to class or not. My bed is so comfortable. I put my two twin beds together and now I have a king sized bed. I love sprawling out on my bed after walking back from class or coming home from a night in Austin. I love UT and I cannot wait until the first football game even though I am leaving town. I am going to Birmingham for my grandmother's 80th birthday. It will be good to see my parents again. My sister is a senior at UT this year and she is going to graduate in the Spring. She is a PR major. This summer she interned for your daughter at Pennebaker Designs. Well I think that is 20 minutes so I am going to stop. I think I am going to go get something to eat. Pizza or maybe some quesadillas. ",1
1657,"     Well, let me see, i have a lot of stuff to do. got to write this, then i got to go to the soccer meeting, then i have to try and figure out stuff for the plane tomorrow. Im kind of hungry, not really but kind of. Man, i want some chicken strips. i want the light to be turned on. My friend here is playing a cool computer game having to do with terrorists and stuff, he just told me he was doing awesome on it. . Were waiting for Rachel, she should be here soon hopefully. I don't know whether i should go out or stay for the intrasmural soccer meeting . . hmm, im going to try and see if anything important is going to be said at this meeting. I also have to take a shower. . It's funny how college life is, its like real life, dependent, you have to be self-disciplined which is hard. College is actually a challenge, it is hard to stay focused on books when you have so many parties and activities to go to, and people to talk to. 10-1, thats pretty good. Jason's getting good at that game. . . my friend's calling me . . ahh distracted. kind of cold, hmm wait, no its good actually. I don't know what to write for this.

134,"I love this song. It reminds me of Plano, and when I hung out with my old friends. I wonder where they're at right now?  I wonder if they're ok, and if they're doing well at college. WhereÃ¯Â¿Â½s my roommate. He should be back by now. He must be eating. I wonder why this c. d. keeps skipping, I know it's not scratched. I can't wait till tonight. I can't forget about my laundry in twenty minutes. It better still be there when I go for it, or somebody's losing a leg. Actually, I trust most everyone on this floor because they're all pretty cool and I've met most all of them. The guy down the hall, he's pretty cool, he just isn't used to Texas life. the heat yes, since he's from Hawaii, but the people no. Should I rush a frat, or not. There are many great advantages to this, but I really don't want to join a bunch of guys I don't know and find out they're a bunch of losers, or drugees. I guess I'll never know until I decide to join, it's just whether or not I think they're cool. A lot, if not all of my friends, have joined a frat, so I can find out who likes their frat, and who doesn't to figure out which one I'd like to rush or pledge. I'm actually rushing them all, because there is no reason not to. My sister will give me the drop since she went here not to long ago. I'll ask here and get here to help me out because a lot of her friends are alumni's of the better frats. This part of the song is the best. It always makes me feel so happy, like I could do anything. Wait one sec, I have to sing along. Dangit, when is Susan going to call back, there are so many Plano people here in Austin I feel like I'm at high school all over again, just a bigger neighborhood to party in. I don't like driving here to much because there are no medians, and the speed limits aren't posted anywhere. I'm not used to having to drive sooo aggressively here. I mean I always drive aggressively, but I wonder if people here take offensive driving, instead of defensive driving. Now it is time for me to go take a safe walk, since my car is so dang far away.

410,"it stresses me . I this what I want to do or I am finishing something merely because I feel I have to. I think this is what I want my degree in but just maybe not what I want to do seriously. I am so much happier about my life at school already. I want to meet a good guy that I can hang out with and not worry about how I look and stupid stuff like that. I just hope it happens pretty soon. I love art now. There something so mysterious about it to me. What were they thinking?  Although I think some of it is sketchy as to call it some sort of meaningful piece but I guess it is to them. It is definitely one of those things left to the beholder. I am not sure if I buy into all this psychology stuff,  It is a little hard to follow. We'll see. Just out of curiosity, what are they going to be able to tell about me from this bit of blabber. I bet they read a lot of weird stuff. I am normal, I guess. Sometimes I am a bit complicated but in an interesting way, of course. I do stress about that. If I am to complicated for the guys I am around at school. So many of them are just existing until their next beer. Get a life. and a job. I think I am looking in the wrong place. maybe I am looking and that is my problem. It is kind of something that makes time pass. You know, waiting for the next guy, wondering what he'll be like, if you know him already, if he has a girlfriend. I am stressing that I will have to stay up too late tonight. Couldn't stay awake in class,  That bothers me. It is rude. I don't know what to say for 20 minutes. I probably won't go the whole time. I have a lot to do. I wonder what they think of me so far. Honestly what I am thinking now is not always what is on my mind so forming some sort of a synopsis is unjust. Just checked to see how much I had written. This is really boring, you know. I talk to myself all day. The last thing I wanted to do was write it down. I have to try to balance my spending every month. I have 3 weeks left and its not looking good, already. If only I had a job, I wouldn't feel so bad about asking for extra cash every month. But I don't and I do feel bad. I must go, this is driving me insane. I keep thinking about what I have to do. ",1

693,"First of I would like to clear something up. Yes you did pay for Bally's but for the money you paid I wore Walamrt and Target clothes and Payless Shoes. I also hardly think that the $30 a month you paid for me equates to the Hundreds you pay for Andrew. Second I paid for that Fronce trip myself and then paid my self back at S&S. In no way did you go into debt in anyway on my behalf. I did earn a lot of money this summer. I spent very little of it and saved most of it - so YOU wouldn't have to pay for stuff in college. I don't think having a car is a sign of love- I think it is a sign of favoritism. That's what makes me cry and get really upset. The two main reason's Andrew got a car was not that he has a job (that's why he's keepiong it) but because he's a male and Dad obviously identifies with him more. Nevermind that I try to save money, do well in school, or generally try to make life easy for you. I guess maybe if I act like an obnoixious bastard, and think only of myself, and step over every one I could get a little appreciation in this family. Having a car here is imparactical and honestly, I don't know what y'all can do to make me feel any better about that car thing. The damamge is done. My whole life I felt loved and I'm not saying I don't fell it now but the car thing and then you trying to play it off as acceptable was a big blow. I was very upset. Not that I didn't mean what I wrote, but I could of said it in a kinder way. I had a really long talk about it with Will and he made me feel a little better about it- the car thing. The reason I get so upset is not because I want a car (it's impractical here) it's that it symbolizes something. Logically I know it means nothing, but I still hurt when I think about it. I'm really confused. I think I get emotional about it because I think it's so unfair, I can't do anything about it, and I get so mad I cry. Another thing I have observed is I can't talk to dad about it. I don't know why I feel it necessary to ""protect him"" from me being sad about something he had a large part in. I guess it's the same logic that made me not ask more than twice for a car myself- he always looked really sad that ""he couldn't afford it"" I can't even really talk about it with you; I have to write about it. I guess it's because we've communicated through notes for as long as I can remember. Maybe I get sad about it because I don't understand why I feel this way and no one understands my feelings. I really meant it when I said I didn't know what could return me to the way I felt before the incident. And all the while I'm thinking what a ridiculous reaction to a car. I was upset about it at home, but here there's a lot of time to think. Here, no one LOVES me. sure maybe as a friend but not the same kind of love that I was SURE of at home. The car thing left me a tiny bit less sure of that love so that's why I'm upset about it. I KNOW that objects don't measure love. It's just that you don't do such an unjust thing to someone you love- give a hugely expensive, and a sign of higher status to someone younger and less considerate. I guess it's really the injustice that hurts me. This letter itself is really ironic in some way. I write to soften the blow to your feelings when you obviously didn't think of my feelings at all -and here I am up at midnight worrying about yours. well I'm going to bed now, I've got school and work tomorrow.

1513,"Right now it id 9:30 in the morning and I wish that I was still asleep. I had a Biology discussion this morning and it was really boring. I don't really understand what goes on in that class. Science isn't my best subject, but I guess I am going to have to improve that because my major is mainly based on that. And if I don't do well in those classes, I can't get accepted into upper divison. I'm not sure. I have been thinking about changing out of nursing because I really want to dance but I just don't think that there is a living in that profession. But at least I would really enjoy it. I wish I were more like my bestfriend in that aspect. He does what he wants because he wants to do it. He isn't worried about his future and I know that's kind of bad, but he really loves what he does. And he is good at it. I just don't seem to be good at much of anything and school just worries me. I wish I could push myself more, but I just don't have the motivation. I try at least. My classes are really hard and I am worried about doing well in them. This is my first time to be away from home and I want to prove to everyone that I am not as incapable as everyone thinks that I am. My own boyfriend doesn't really have faith in me. He thinks that I can't hold my own and that I have to depend on everyone else to help me through what I do. And maybe in some aspects that is true. I have had a difficult time just being myslef. I feel like people don't want to talk to me, or that what I say isn't as important as the next person. Enough about my problems though, right? Today I am going to get a tattoo. I have always wanted one and I have never had the nerve to go and get one. I think it is going to hurt really bad but I think that I am finally ready for one. I have been looking at what kind I want and printed some out off the computer. I hope that they can do the one that I want. I guess I am just going to have to wait and see what happens with that. Today I have 3 classes left to go to. This being one of them. I have a hard time paying attention in this Psychology class. I just can't seem to get interested in it for a complete hour and a half. All of my other classes are just 50 minutes and it seems easier to pay attention in them. But I added this class so 3:30 was the only time that was left open. I had to take it. Thinking about school, I am going to go home and take summer school at SFA. I feel that if I can get some credtis there and transfer them here that it might take some of the load off for next year. I already came with 6 hours but that isn't very many. I am really determined to get into upper division nursing after 2 years. I don't know what I will do if I don't. I guess I will just transfer back home and go to school there if I can't get in here. But I really want to prove that I can get in here. I am trying really hard in my classes, but it just doesn't seem to be doing me any good. I read what I am supposed to and work the problems, but I just can't seem to learn the material. I'm not taking any dance classes right now which is really ackward for me. I have never gone a year without dancing. Last year I was dancing 4-6 hours every week day and this is just strange. I don't excerise in any other way than that so I am starting to feel out of shape. Dancing was my way to let everything out. I wasn't always as good as I wish that I could be, but it was a way for me to prove to people that I was good at something. Here I can't do that. I am just another person walking down the side walk. At home, in such a small town, everyone knew who I was. And here I think I know about 20 people at the most. None of my friends came here so it isn't like I really have a relase. I am going to go home this weekend, and I know it is kind of soon, but I really miss my boyfriend. Maybe I am just not cut out for this large college atmosphere. It might be best if I go home, I know mom and dad would like that a lot more. But I am tired of doing everything for my parents. I never did anything in high school for myself. Mom and I got into arguments all the time and it seemed like my whole life I was just trying to prove myself to her. She treated me like a child even last year, like I was still 12 and couldn't take care of myself. Being an only child I was smothered by my parents and grandparents. I don't know. It was nice getting what I always wanted, but sometimes I wished that there was someone else there to put the blame on. It's hard to handle everything that went on in my family. Someone once told me to write down what bothered you and it would make you understand better about what was going on and how to fix it. It doesn't work. Besides, I get tired of writing all of that down. I am super duper hungry right now butI don't want to eat because I am really afraid of the freshman 15. I haven't been eating well lately. I won't eat most of the time, but then it seems like when I actually do eat, it isn't anything healthy. The only good we have in our room is gronola bars and froot loops. Like that is healthy. At least I have been drinking a lot of water. Well, my time to write is almost up. Thank God because I am really getting tired sitting here and doing this. Also, I have a class in 15 minutes and I really need to leave and go there. So, I guess I have a couple more of these things to do during the rest of the semester. Fun fun fun, I can't wait. ",0
2188,"Stream of Consciousness? How do you start something so vague. I keep a journal which I write in occasionally, but I can not remember the last time an assignment consisted solely of write your thoughts. "" I'd be willing to bet that the beginning of most of these streams is a self consciousness, because that is definitely what I am feeling right now. It's late Monday night and I am taking this time to break up the reading that I have fallen behind in. While I am technically still studying psychology, it does provide a nice change of pace to the abysmal pages of text. What is the point of this assignment anyway? How could one person possibly gather a conclusion from over 600 students listing off whatever pops into their mind? I guess the biggest amazement for me is how these psychologists are able to gather data from such an unreliable subject. the human mind. There really is no other single entity (besides the female mind) which is so complex and irregular. Humans are an interesting study, which explains why so many students choose to take anthropology, sociology and history. But psychology really is the king of the social sciences, it's all but required for a college student. I couldn't believe how stereotypical I felt when I uttered the phrase ""my psych class"", it's the single most overheard expression on this campus outside of the greek alphabet. Now that I mentioned the greek societies on our campus, I'd like to delve into that a little. After overhearing a pack of sorority girls outside of Kinsolving today, (they travel in packs) their conversation only bolstered my opinion that Sororities and Fraternities actually limit social interaction. Sure it's great to pile in kids to the parties and attempt to shack up with a sorority chick, but I honestly don't feel compelled to join a fraternity. Free beer and life long friends may be something that is promised upon the rush season, but it seems to me that in exchange the member loses their individuality. Fraternity issues become the mindset of the member, and any excuse to discuss those issues with another person, be they in the same frat or not, is almost always taken advantage of. Yes, some fraternities do some good community work, but it limits people into one train of thought, their loyalty is admirable to the members, but to the outside they seem transparent and single minded. Of course, coming from a freshman non-frat male, that sounds like every other person with an opinion, ready to lay waste to the organizations with his individuality. I really don't oppose the fraternity/sorority concept, because it is a need some people truly need filled. But the sight of another party where 70% of the attendance is male, 20% are lifeless girls not interested in meeting people, and the other 10% are passed out, it makes them all seem the same. I feel that rant about fraternities could pass as given off by anybody, but not only did that illustrate my frustration with constantly hearing about the Kappa party or the Pi Phi foam bash, but helped me vent to something beyond my friends who also are constantly kicked out of those parties. I feel definitely stereotypical again, from discussing my feelings toward psychology to my frustration with frat parties, could I possibly be the more prototypical male? Well, here's the sinker, it's time to discuss sports. I cover them for a newspaper, but honestly I'm just like another fan, but willing to put in the work. Too often the news pages are filled with guys who belong on the radio, it's like their verbal garbage should be filling empty air time instead of priceless page space. Any fan with a computer can put together that the Cowboys are in a rebuilding year, but how many fans would be willing to go to the practices, meet the coaches and do the dirty work of actually uncovering the story. I guess I am frustrated with the lazy column writing which features another talking head giving his 'take' about the latest controversy regarding sports. That's not to say that all of them are  garbage, but too many of them I find repetitive and dull, and bringing nothing new to the argument. Covering a sport is different than giving an opinion, and I enjoy covering sports because of its complexity and difficulty of trying to shape a story out of thin air. I love the hunt, and that not only makes me strange, but a pretty good fit for a newspaper writer. Of course, as a college freshman, I really don't have an inkling of an idea on what is my true calling, but I figure the experience couldn't hurt. Much like my decision to take this psychology class, it may seem stereotypical, but the experience and exposure to a new understanding of the human brain could not hurt my chances on a better understanding of myself and others. My time is up, I am sorry to whoever is reading this, it must seem very much like the others I'm sure, but I look forward to this class and I thank you for this very interesting assignment. ",0
93,Today was a good day I enjoy life. I wish I was at home with my girlfriend. she is so pretty I am in love yet it is not here. I wish that she could be here to join me. Frat life is demanding yet it should be a good payoff in the near future I wish I could sleep I am so tired that it is hard to stay awake at times during the day I really enjoy this kind valentine assignment it lets me express my true feelings  and thoughts with no real worries except that if it will arrive when it needs to. 20 minutes is a long time to write continuously but it really is neat to think off all the things that go on in my head. like home and vlentina. that is her name the lovely girl that I left back home when I came to college. I am scared that I will not do as well as I can I hope so I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t want to let me dad down he is very important to me even though he is a bit scary at times. but that is how they are supposed to be right? oh well I hope my dog is doing ok I love her so my thoughts drift now into wanting to be on some other planet that is why I love astronomy. even thought it is kind confusing. but it is fun nonetheless I love to use the internet I think that it is so neat. I do however wish I could find a good use for it. all I ever do is waste time going from place to place not knowing where I am going. kinda like life we seem to wander from place to place and never seem to  truly settle down at least that is the way things seem right now in a few years  however I am sure that my opinion will change. I know that once I can complete college which is my number one goal above all else. then to have fun and party. I hope this week we will have a good party I know we will. we always have the best parties. and there  are always girls there. yet I do wish that valentina could be there. even though  she did start to bother me before I left. now it seems that we have gotten closer at the same time that we are apart. is she the girl for me? I do not know and whish  that I did. it seems that way at times. yet then at other times she just bugs me to death an \d all I can think of is getting away from her. I never want to loose her though. I do really care for her. I am looking forward to seeing here soon on my birthday she will stay with me I hope. but I will probably not see her that much since I am so  busy I guess I will just have to make the time to see her. I hope that she loves me I really do. I miss my parents and my old room. my room i\ here is great and I have  fun with my roommates all of whom are from my home in fort worth. so we get along well not like some of the girls that came here boy they cant stand each other and we have only  been here for 3 weeks. not even a full month. I cant believe I am writing this much I normally cannot write this much when working on a paper but now I can I guess I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t really have to think about what I am writing just write it. I think that it is neat . wow that was a fast 20 minutes. I can't believe that it is over oh well I still have on more assignment to do. ,1
1187,"Okay. So I need to write what's on my mind. Right now all I can think of is that chemistry test I just took at 9:30am this morning. It was my first test in college I was scared as hell before I took it because I was scared I would run into problems I didn't know how to workout and I would not pass the test. Now I'm sitting in anxiety for the results. I keep going to the site to see if the results are posted yet. I have butterflies in my stomach. I'm trying almost anything I can think of to get the test off my mind, one of my choices being going ahead and doing this assignment, but it only makes me more anxious. Goodness I feel so behind in my classes and I don't know why I mean I have work to do, but they aren't due for a while and I got time to relax, but can't. Again that stupid test is on my mind. Why does it torture me so? I'm sitting here praying I will get an 'A' on it because I gave it the best shot I could have even if I had studied continuously the whole week, I wouldn't have been able to do better. I guess partially out of regret for waiting to study until the night before, but there wasn't much material to learn and there was nothing new on it for me. The entire thing was a review for me from chemistry II my junior year. My stomach is in huge knots and I feel scared for some odd reason now it's like some sort of intuition or warning signs are going off inside of me bad warning signs and I don't like it. Those warning signs usually mean I'm in trouble for something, but I don't know why yet why I could be in trouble. I hate not knowing things. It makes me feel so vulnerable and I hate being put on a spot like that. My gosh I hope I didn't fail the test, otherwise I'll be in so much trouble it's not even funny. I just relaxed my shoulders and they hurt now from being so tense. I wish I could relax right now. Maybe I'll go work out to release some of my stress as soon as I'm through typing this assignment I still have 9 more minutes according to the clock. Man, I really hope I run into Siddharth today again that boy is really cute! But one thing puzzles me does Alvin like me? He always notices me and waves, but last night, he was like with me for a long time and kept saying how everyone is going to think there is something going on between us BULL CRAP THEY WILL! I think he wants me to think that they already do and might as well go with the flow the way he was hinting it. Man! that test, but it's not that anymore I feel like I'm in trouble and I don't know why is everything okay at home? I sure do hope so. Why do I concern my self so much everything will be okay no? Hey! need to write my cousins I really don't feel like writing Sonu now, I'll write him over the weekend when I go home. Man I've gained so much weight it's not even funny. but anyways my 20 minutes are over I hope this assignment is long enough I don't want to get in trouble for quantity this assignment is so weird and it scares me you just write what's on your mind I've never done that I've always had to think what I write and it's terrifying because any minute I feel someone is going to jump and say its wrong and I'll get a zero.

210,"Well, my name is Robert Marshall Reinauer Jr. I am now thinking about what I am thinking. I am thinking about Physics. Physics is hard because I have never taken a class in it and the first one I am taking is a college course. Another thing I am thinking about is how long these lines are and how much of a page am I really writing. Did you guys set it up this way on purpose to see something or to tell something about us. Well, if you want to know something that I am feeling right now is that these lines really annoy me by being so long. That is o. k. cause I will just deal with it. I am also thinking about my home and what my girlfriend is doing. If she misses me and other things about her. I am missing her. Studying here is tough and so are the classes. But hopefully that will just make me learn more. There are two girls next to me and they are talking alot. Usually I get people next to me in the computer lab that talk in French and Spanish so I don't know what they are saying and it does not bug me as much. Finally the end of the abnormal typing line. Well, I can understand what these girls are talking about and I don't even really care but they are still distracting me from providing a researchable paper. It really does not annoy me that much but, I like perfect situations and that means everything goes my way. Unfortunately that does not always happen. Guess what they just left. It is really quiet and I can think lots better. Well, since I have been in college I have thought about the future more. Does everyone think about the future more in college. I bet the majority does. I am really worried about how everything is going to work out after college if there is an after college. I would like to become a big success and become a great doctor but so would a million other people and I know there is not room for a million other people which narrows the picking for medical school. I will just do my best and the hope the best comes of it. Nobody knows though what will happen. This is pretty neat turning in a paper on the computer. Finally another line. I am going to try to pick up another class because I need more hours. I hope I can get something that will help me maximize my time here. My counselors said that I can only take 12 hours which is nice advice but who has to go to school here them or me. I would like to get out of here as soon as possible. Not because I don't like it, but just cause I am eager to see what I will be in the future, a success or a complete failure. Well, 20 minutes is up and I have to confess that I have been correcting my grammatical mistakes just cause I feel better if I do. I hope you understand. Bye.         ",1
986,"Right now I am feeling very annoyed. I have to do my first lab write up and I am so confused. I wish I could get it all done now so that this holiday weekend I wouldn't have to worry about it. I am going home this weekend for the first time in a month or so. Even though I am a junior I have felt like such a freshmen this past week becuause I just transfered here. I don't think that's a bad thing , to feel like a freshmen, but it's really weird. I can't wait to go home. I got my parents and my brother a UT gift form the Co Op I can't believe that Jennifer is getting married this weekend. I think the wedding will be a lot of fun. I love the dress that I get to wear since I am a bridesmaid. I really though that if anyone was going to get married first it would be me. I am the one that hads the most stable realationship. i really hope taht their marriage works out. They haven't always gotten along really well. In fact when I first met her a year ago he was galavanting around town with some 5 other gulklirls. She is just that type of girl though to go for the ""jerk"" kind of guy. i really think that this was more of a pressure thing that they are doing this because since he went into the Air Force and then found out that he was going to Alaska I think he was scared to do it alone and he knew that he has always had her buy a string. I n all the time that I have known them they have never been really compasionate to each other and whats worse is that I used to hate him because of how he treated her and all the things I heard about him. well I wish the best for the two of them. I hope I don't forget anything for the wedding this weekend. I am still so nervous about this semester since I am in a new school. I think that I will be okay though because I know how to magage my time and use it wisely. It's dunny because there is always something to do. Tonight I made dinner for my boyfriend, my roomate and 2 of his roomates. That makes me feel good when I can do other things for people like that. We had spagetti salad french bread and I baked some cookies. I am feeling a t peace with myself right now becuase I now that I am doing all I can do to be the best. Not because I made dinner. But because I have gotten so much accomplished today int he way of school work and all the errands I had to run. It is so nice to sit here in this quiet apartment by myself and write for 20 min. I feel bad because I din't work out today. I have been doing really well though by going at least 3-4 times a week and running 2-3 miles a day and then doing weights. For some reason though I feel really fat. When I think about what I ate at dinner I want to gag. Oh my gosh I just thought about my Gov class and how boring it is. It was funny though becuase he was telling us that one student said that it was so boring it made him want to gounge his eyes out with a spoon. That;s hilarious becuase thats kind of how I felt today. The cool thing is that he published his lecture notes and I think they will help out a lot. He is also going to give out the test that he used in the summer for us to study. I don't think I have had a prof with worse organizationl skills. I was trying to take notes and it was so hard becuase he jumps around so much. you got to feel sorry for the guy though. At least he knows that he is not the most interesting guy. He also told us thata student told him that he talked like Norm Mcdoland. Very monotone. That was funny. The more and more I think about it it is true. Geez I can't believe I still have to do that long lab report that is going to take me forever and my TA has still not emailed me beck. At least for the first one she is going to grade them and then return them so we can correct it. That's really cool of her   ",1
1851,"     It's cold in here. I need to sleep. I'm missing my best friend. One more class until the day is over. Some time to myself. My head hurts. I need to study. My long distance phone bill will drive my mom nuts. I miss my boyfriend. He's so far away. One more month until I see him again. I need to make a phone call. Should I listen to what they say. I'm all alone. Finally. I'm sore. When will this week end? I had a conversation. Did he think I was dense? Should I tell Jacob? He shouldn't be jealous. What have I left behind? What lies ahead? There's something in my eye. I hate wearing contact lenses. When will my brother call? I smell like Listerine. I spilled it on the floor of my dorm. I wonder if my roomate noticed. Is she there right now? Did anyone call? Should I call home? I haven't called my mother. Is Joshua here? What about Joanna? What about Lilia? Are they here? Will I see them? I'm still cold. I want to go to bed. I should eat something right now. Nevermind, maybe later. What should I do tommorow? The day's almost over. One more class to go. Journalism should be fun. Hope I don't fall asleep. Why did her alarm go off so early this morning? Why didn't she let me sleep? I'm quiet when she's asleep. I don't throw my stuff around. Why did she make so much noise? Why couldn't I sleep last night? What woke me up? Why was I so scared? Will I be able to sleep tonight? I wonder what she thinks of me? Is she annoyed that I'm always on the phone? Does it bother her that I'm so quiet. I'm studying whenever she gets in. Does she think that's all I do? Is that good or bad? Will we get along? Has she said anything to her friends about me? Do I bother her when she's studying? Does she think she bothers me? It is so cold in here. I can't feel my fingers anymore. What are we going to talk about in journalism? I hope it doesn't rain tonight. I can't sleep when it rains. I wonder if it rained at home. Has anyone tried to call me? Has anyone e-mailed me? Did I take good notes in class? Why am I so tired? I wonder what Jacob is doing right now. Maybe I should call him. I have to go upstairs and get my book. I'm used to being alone. Talking to him gives me a reason to smile. He brightens my day. I hope they win on Friday. I need to get a job. I don't have any money. My phone bill is already too much. I've just been here a week. Every night I spend two hours on the phone. I wonder how much it is going to be. My legs hurt. I need to run some more. Maybe three miles tommorow. There's still something in my eye. It hurts a lot. The computers won't print in here. I'll probably be back later. I'll bring a sweater next time. I wonder how the band is doing back home. Are they outside practicing right now? Why hasn't Laura answered my e-mail? Is she too busy? I can't believe I gave that guy my phone number? What was his name again? He was really funny. I needed to talk to someone. Should I tell Jacob? He'll get mad. I know he will. He'll get mad and just not tell me. Its really cold in here. I want to go upstairs. ",0
296,"I just met you. How can this feeling be?  It is a happy feeling. Its just awkward. I haven't felt it in awhile, at least since another soul and I grew apart. Things just faded. Two different people, two different lives. But now the emotion lurks once more in my heart. I try to fight it, but I can't. Something tells me to follow my heart, submit, and give in to the strong, enticing feeling that is just starting a war inside me. Thoughts just continuously rumble through my head; they won't stop. There's no control. I can't change how I feel. This is a crazy world. Everything just seems upside down. There is too much to think about in life. Who ever said it would be this complicated?  I wish there were just a secret to life and somebody would fill me in. I could just do anything I wanted to do. Pleasure could be my sole guide down every path in this extensive journey. The thought of consequences would never even enter my mind. I could live life day by day, and my only obligation would be to live. I would just enjoy life and breathe it in. Too many people today miss out on the beauty of their surroundings, the people they come in contact with and their environment. If a person merely goes through life only seeking material success, where is the true worth in that life?  That person would miss out on everything with true meaning and depth. Therefore, he or she is not really living but merely becoming a trained robot to fit into the machine of our material world. Things are so weird now. It seems that people have lost site of their morals and are only living to climb the corporate ladder. What kind of life is that?  Oh well, everybody is different. What is important to me may not be important to others. I went to Mount Bonnel yesterday, and it was breath taking. I watched the sun set and the stars and moon come out. There was a gentle breeze that would pass over my face and lips and blow through my hair. At that moment, all stress seemed to disappear. It was complete tranquility and bliss. It made me want to just sit up on the mountain, take in the view, let my thoughts run free, and just live. ",0
435,"I am almost five hundred miles from home, and I don't know anyone here. I'm not sure that what I feel is loneliness because I'm constantly surrounded by people here at the dorm, but I just don't feel at home here yet. People here are very nice, and I know everyone else is in the same position as I am in, but I really feel that this place isn't for me. I really want to go home so I can be around the people I grew up with and feel at home with. I have many regrets about coming here away from all my friends and family, but then again, I realize that UT is a great school, and my educational background will be greatly benefited. I suppose it's worth the sacrifices in the long scheme of things. Maybe it is better for me to be here away from everyone else, as it should help me become much more independent and learn how to function alone. I've already learned a lot in the week since I've been here, and I feel that I've grown up a lot. I've had to do everything for myself, and force myself to go out and meet new people. My trust issue has become worse here, however, because I used to trust almost everyone, and now, I'm not sure who to trust and who not to trust. I know that if I can just stick it out for a while that I'll grow to love this place because I love learning and new experiences, and I'm definitely going to get both of those things here at UT. I can always transfer back home next semester if I don't adjust here well. I love the people here because they all seem so friendly. I do feel that I'll eventually make many new friends and this place will seem like home. I cannot sleep or eat here yet. I think it's just the adjustment phase. I have nightmares when I try to sleep, so I've grown accustomed to very few hours of sleep each week. I have no appetite, and every time I try to eat, I get this very sick feeling. I'm seriously hoping both of these feelings will go away soon. Maybe that is just due to being homesick and not being in a place where I feel comfortable yet. I want to go home for the long weekend, but I think that will make it much harder when I come back. I don't think I'll want to leave my home again to return here. Maybe it's just the people I left behind that I miss, but I think mostly it's always knowing someone everywhere I go there that makes me feel comfortable back in my hometown. On top of these things, my ex-boyfriend calls often here, and that makes it very difficult. We're still best friends and tell each other everything. The only reason we're not together now is because of our different college choices, and talking to him makes me want to return home even more. We do plan to get back together as soon as we graduate, but that's a long time from now, and not seeing him often is going to be very hard for me. I've known him for 13 years and relied upon him for everything. I went out with someone else this past weekend, and I felt very bad for it. Even though we're not together, I know that he's the one I want, and I wonder if it's wrong to even date other people if I know I still love him and always will. It's made me feel bad when I talk to him, and I even told him about it. He says it will all be ok, but I just don't know. I'm so confused. There isn't a simple answer to anything I try to do here, and everything I do seems to have some kind of drawback to it. Maybe if I sink myself into my studies, I will not forget, but maybe set aside the hurt that I feel right now. I think I should give that a try, and maybe start a rigorous exercise program so that I will be more tired at night, which might make me get some more rest and increase my appetite a little bit. Maybe I should try to get out of this building. It seems very cold and uninviting, and I think another place might be better for me. Well, I know that with my faith in God that everything will work out for the best if I just put my complete effort into it. It's all for the best! ",1
1993,"What a strange assignment. Why did the typing start indented? Twenty minutes seems like a long time and the timer does not make anything go any faster. It's weird that the one thing you look forward to all day turns out to suck. What do wounded ducks look like? Alright, 1% complete with this assignment. Physics is really hard, but I actually understand everything fairly well. I suppose that's a plus. I wish Lindsay would talk to me. I really miss her companionship. I suppose now is where you notice that I am a normal college kid going through the feelings and emotions. I really hate to be normal. I am not somebody who is outrageous to be not normal because that is conforming to another standard. I instead just do what works for me and disregard most everybody else. I really miss Lindsay. I wish I knew what to do to get he back. I think that is the problem, you can't get someone back, you can only hope they come back. I really hope the power doesn't go off in the middle of this assignment (knock on wood). It's been going out recently. Alright, almost 25% complete. Maybe I shouldn't track my progress. Is anybody really going to read this? Is this simply an experiment? Maybe it's a wpm counter like in computer class. Here comes the scary part in the music. I am listening to Firebird Suite. It really is a neat song, but it lacks something, not sure what but something. What if you started this assignment at 4:50 on Friday? That would really be horrible, but it wouldn't be quite as bad as starting it at 4:41. That would actually be ironically funny. Good times. Something is odd. Not sure what, but something seems a bit strange. I want some natural light, I really can't stand these fluorescent lights. These buildings also are disturbing. I didn't live in the country, but I really miss the trees I had around my house. Living amongst these lonely trees is strange. It's like they are put on display as something that used to be. I want to go to a school that is in the trees. I am talking a tree house. In the trees of the Amazon. That would be a sweet experience. The window, right. Haha, of course I open my window and see construction. Great, just great. It's rather depressing. Alright, more than 50% complete. This could really be a dangerous thing if you really tapped into your thoughts. Might find something you don't want to find. Hmm. I hat that feeling of being hungry after you've just ate. Is ate the right word there? I think it might be eaten"", who knows. I feel like I have something to do, but I really don't know what it is. It felt really good to sleep in this morning. I kind of felt lazy, but none-the-less, it felt great. I saw Cedric Benson in his Escalade XLT today. That is a very nice vehicle he has. Almost 75% completed. What a bunch of crazy rambling. It must suck to be the one to read all of these. I suppose you just search for keywords and check their frequentness. Is that a word? Who cares? I know you don't. I am running out of thoughts and my right pinky hurts, perhaps I should learn how to more properly type. I type pretty well I think, I just have this mysterious pain in my pinky. Shadows are the only two dimensional objects. Shadows are cast from three dimensional objects. So is it safe to say that three dimensional objects are shadows of 4 dimensional objects? Can we say that we are shadows of time? There's a predicament. What is time? That's also a predicament. That would be cool if somebody would call me right now. I really don't want to have to get up so early on Saturday (7:00). Oh well, can't do much about it I guess. I wonder how Phoebe is doing? That thought was brought on by a song that I just heard. Time is almost up. Check you on the flip side. Ciao. ",1
1173,"Just sitting down and actually listening to your thoughts has become a rare event for most adolescents. I think it would be wise if I put myself on a quiet place and just thought about things such as my life, beliefs, and future. Today I went to a meeting for KVR News and received tons of information about the station and what I needed to do if I wanted to be apart of it. The meeting was extremely informative, almost too informative. My head was spinning by the time I left the station. I learned so much and that was only the tip of the iceberg. I feel as though I am behind in life right now. I'm definitely already behind in my schoolwork, but in other things too. I still feel as though as I am at camp not in my new home. My other friends already feel comfortable here. It also seems like there are numerous assignments and activities that I can't fit into a twenty four hours! I miss my best friend named Dana. She went to Tulane. She is doing well which makes me happy. Speaking of happiness, certain things in my life these days are causing me to experience extreme happiness. This is impressive because a year ago I was debating whether or not anyone could obtain true happiness. Now I am a firm believer. You see, about three months ago I met a beautiful guy by the name of John. He is intelligent, funny, artistic, and the best boyfriend a girl could ask for. This has been the longest not to mention the only serious relationship I have ever been in. John makes me feel pretty. He looks out for me and he loves me. When I am with him I am completely happy. Another strong catalyst to my blissfulness is food and the Jester Cafeteria has been coming through. Of course, I have to focus in quantity not quality! Whenever I eat there I get lost in the selections. So much to eat so little space! Though I reach these peaking moments of happiness, every once in a while they disappear. When I was filling out my pretesting questionnaire I started to feel depressed. All the questions were bringing up topics and ideas that made me think about how I handled issues. I'm not good at issues. I tend to bottle things up. I'm not good at verbalizing my emotions. This combination is dangerous. Sometimes I wonder if I have made wise choices. I wonder if my parents miss me. I wonder if my friends long to see me too. My selfconfidence is like one crazy roller coaster. One minute I am a gorgeous intellectual woman who knows what she wants and the next I am an ugly confused little girl who can't figure anything out. It is a good thing for me to acknowledge these things and occurrences in my life. I am very thankful for what God has given me. ",1
1502,"Well, I'm listening to music right now and just relaxing. I'm about to start studying for Chemistry and Psychology so I do have a bit of work to do tonight. In Chemistry I need to do the homework and also the work for the discussion session. I'm almost done with the psychology chapter I've been reading all week. It's the most interesting book I've been reading, followed by biology, then chemistry. All of it kind of ties in together though which helps out a lot. Today I met a lot of people from my freshman interest group, which is kind of nice because I haven't met many people due to me living in an apartment. My phone line finally came in today after a week of waiting so I'm just now able to get on the internet, which I've sorely missed. It was pretty tiring moving all of my roommates and my furniture to our apartment because we're on the third floor. I have enjoyed school a lot more than usual so far, probably because it is actually interesting compared to high school. I'm glad someone picked up my shift at the Outback tomorrow to give me more study time, and also it helps because my car is in the shop and it was going to be hard to leave psychology at 5 and be dressed and ready for work at 6, especially without a car. I want to do the pretesting for the psych labs but the net is giving me a broken link. Oh well, I guess I'll do it later and maybe it will be fixed. I just got everything in my apartment organized today. I bought some hanging folders for all of my handouts, which are really helping, and other various organizers. I kind of like this assignment, I'm doing work but it's over what I'm thinking at the time and let's me see my thoughts. It's kind of like a recap of the day, because that's mainly what's on my head. Hopefully tomorrow I'll wake up on time considering that this morning I woke up at 9:10 and had to high tail it to my chemistry class by 9:30. Oh well, it's been about 20 minutes so I'm going to go ahead and study now for my classes. It was fun. ",1
1018,"I hate this type of assignment, the kind of work that tries to force a thought into one's head. Thoughts should come naturally, and when the mind is prompted, then nothing comes to it. Well, as long as I'm supposed to be thinking, let's think about why I'm doing this. It's to get a good grade. Why do I do anything. I always seem to respond in a manner in which the answer seems acceptable to everyone else. Maybe I'm doing this to please everyone else: my instructor, my parents, myself. So why do I do everything else that I do?  Why do I devote so much time to working out and exercise?  Is it because I want to fool myself into living longer?  Is it to mold my body in such a way as to attract others and get their attentions. I always say that I just don't want to become weak, that when I find someone to protect, I want to be able to protect them. But if I am always desparately trying to find this person that would fill the current void in my life, why is it I push everyone away?  My friends, my peers, my elders?  I don't do what everyone says is ""fun. ""  I don't hang around others for long, I don't go to parties, and I rarely impart what I truly feel. It seems as if I've been hiding half my life, hiding from others and from myself. Inside, I scream to myself, ""go out have fun meet new people you boring dolt!""  and in my mind I'm always prepared to do so, but when the moment of truth comes about, I never act out my true intentions, either being intimidated or discouraged. I remember when I went to that UT freshman orientation. My friend said when you get to the dance, just go up to people, introduce yourself, and ask for a dance. And he's a loser. But it worked for him, so I tried it myself. The first time, rejected. The second time, rejected. The third time, rejected, and even I know that 3 strikes is out. I get so sick of hearing excuses like oh I'm too tired or I don't feel like it. Yeah right. Then why the hell are you here at the dance?  Just give me a straight and vehement no and I'll be on my way, not even to think twice about the encounter. Now on strike three, I had another reason for retiring that night. That girl, the way she looked, the way she acted, it was deja vu. I went to another country with a girl like that, stood by her side, opened my heart to her, and offered it to her. She led me on, to believe that for once, I had an opportunity for love, that it was my time in the spotlight, and with the most beautiful girl I have ever been with. Visually stunning, patient but forceful, and gentle, someone to listen. I thought I finally found her, and felt as though I was riding above clouds. Then I just came down hard with the rain. I've never been the same afterwards, because everything was seen in a different light. This third girl at the dance, the rudeness didn't get to me, but the memories of heartbreak was just too much to handle. I asked Tonia out to the dance once, and she came. But we never danced. I asked and she ignored. Just like This time. Love. I'm too young to know its true meanings, and too inexperienced to have any justification in even corrolating it with the words I or me. I'm always looking for ""love"" for companionship without even really knowing what to look for. It can't just be the person that gives you that indescribable burning feeling within. Too many times has that happened. I say to myself, you know what love is. You loved Tonia, because all you ever did was argue, yet you could stand it. She broke your heart, lied to you, worked behind your back, carried you up and dropped you, and yet you still thought of her. Hell, you still think of her. You've been talking to her as a friend and the feeling has never left you. Isn't that enough to be love?  It's as close as I've gotten, I'm sure, but what about prom. To have danced with someone I've never known before, to talk, and to, after so long, have fun. When I held her in my arms, and her hair brushed my face as the slow songs played through, what was that feeling. Was it a feeling of completeness, of safety that as long as with her that nothing can go wrong?  What was that?  I go through sleepless nights thinking of Christie sometimes, someone who I never gave a second thought to until that moment I told her goodbye. The moment in which the swelling in my throat caught even me by surprise. But am I looking for love or just someone. I don't want to end up like my uncle, having married a woman only because she threatened to commit suicide. Is he happy?  Am I happy now?  no, I'm not. ",0
1412,"Yesterday I went to my brother's football game. He is in 7th grade and is the quarterback of the team. I was really proud of him even though they lost 200. My brother's name is Jason and he is also in the ROTC program at his school (Mendez Middle School). I've always admired him for his ability to go out and achieve his goals. Even though he may be scared, he'll try something new. I wish I had his courage and strength. I could never try anything new at least not on my own. Sometimes when things get to hectic for me, I can turn to my brother and I know everything is going to work itself out. My brother is the only boy in a family with three older girls and people have a hard time understanding our closeness to one another, especially my boyfriend. Until he met me he never knew that a brother and a sister could get along so well or have some kind of bond to each other. My brother's friends sometimes tease him about the relationship that he has with me, they'll say ""it's not normal"" or ""ya'll are weird"". But we don't let it bother us because sometimes we fight like cats and dogs but we can't stay mad at each other for long. Onetime on a TV show or a movie, I can't remember but anyway this lady made a comment that brother and sisters could not like each other, it was not sane or normal. He would wait up for me when I would come back from a date or he could not go to sleep until I did. We are five years apart and yet it seems like we are the same age. We both like the same things and keep each other informed about the latest sports trade or the biggest sports upset. I enjoy my brother and the bond that we share because it is unique and that makes it special. Recently, I've noticed that he is growing up into a young man and I get a little sad. The only thing that makes this process easy is that the change will occur on the outside and not in the inside. (I hope). ",0

1084,"Man I wish I could go home, I really miss Lee I know he is right down stairs but I wish he would come over. I can't wait until my sister comes today, we will have so much fun, oh I need to do my homework for math, and I can't forget to go to that meeting at 1:15. That reminds me of what I have to find out about it the subject I want to do. I wish Sarah would wake up I can't believe she was out until 3:00 last night, that is really late, but I guess since she didn't have any classes it is not that big of a deal. I want to eat lunch, I'm really hungry, I need to pack to, I can't believe I have to pack to go down the street, that is so stupid, I need to call my mom and tell her to get nicci to bring that shoulder bag. For next weekend. I'm tired. I wish I were asleep like Sarah. I wonder what our homework for linguistics is? I guess I need to look. This is a really weird thing to do, I wonder if I am doing it right, and what they will find out about me. I wonder if I am crazy, I don't think so though. I miss my mommy! I wish I was going home instead of staying here, but I guess that is ok. Blaire is so stupid sometimes. I need to not forget my stuff in the dryer. I wish blaire and Russ didn't fight all the time, I mean I love them both, but they are so annoying when they argue. Oh yeah, I need to figure out where Benihana's is so we don't get lost, I guess I can look on the Internet. I love Family Feud, and playing it online, but it is hard, cause I always am talking to people and when I am trying to play that stinks. I'm glad Kim and Arianna are my friends, and I'm glad I'm in the fig, it was such a good idea. But I wish I didn't have to take English over again. I wish I could just be in the fig and have just Math and Psychology. I am so tired, I can't believe I had to get up for one class today, I should have just slept in, it is all cloudy and everything any way, why should I get up when it is so dreary outside. Math is so easy; I don't have to go there to understand it. I could just get the homework assignment and I wouldn't need to listen to her talk. Man this is really hard to think of things to write I feel like my mind isn't thinking. I wonder how much longer my stuff in the dryer has. I don't like having to write everything I think, oh yeah I need to call and see how many minutes my phone has on it, so I don't go over. That is a lot of money if I go over my time. I need to look up the phone number to find out how many I have. I wonder whom I call, the place I bought the phone or Nokia, I don't know. I am thinking about thinking, I can't think any more. This is so weird. I wonder what lee is doing. I wonder if I am disturbing Sarah's sleep, oh well she disturbs mine when I am trying to sleep all the time. Man, I really am hungry now; I wish my 20 minutes would hurry up and get over with. I guess I am thinking about doing something else besides this. I am tired of typing. 20 minutes feels like along time when you type continuously. I wish I could think about something else. I can think about sleep, it is good. My bed is too hard though. I need to talk to my mom about that mattress store. I wonder if what Russell said was true? I mean that is crazy if that really happened. I need to go to the store. I need to order nicci's bday cake. Man I'm cold. That fan is really powerful. I wish lee would hurry up and pack so that we could go eat, I'm hungry, but I don't know what to eat, the cafeteria always stinks and the place down stairs is so stinking expensive. I wish that the deli thing would open it will be so good. I wonder what kind of bread they will have. My contacts are drying out from this fan, but luckily I don't have much time left to write. Thank goodness. I hate typing all my thoughts for so long the time seems forever away. I wonder if I am using to many dining dollars, I need to go look and see. I need to pay my thing too. My face itches. Ok it's better. I guess my time is almost up! YEAH! I'm hungry I think I'm almost finished. I need to hurry up and eat though, because I have to get my clothes out of the dryer, so no one steals them. Ok, I'm finished. I need to spell check it now. Bye ",0
2020,"Today has been a pretty good day. I am a little worried about my computer class because I can't understand what they are talking about, but oh well. I am printing out a reading assignment for my history of rock and roll class and it is taking a lot of paper. I wish my ex would call me just to check and see how I am doing. Never mind, don't think about him; he doesn't deserve the time. I start rowing tryouts next week and then the week after that, too. Hopefully I will make the team. That would be really cool, except if I made varsity somehow, I would miss my family. If I was on varsity I would get to travel a lot, all over the US, but I would be gone all the time on the weekends, and never have a chance to go home and see my family and friends. I think college is harder than I thought it was going to be. But, the internet up here, the DSL I have at my apartment, is really fast. I downloaded some songs in like  two minutes, versus two hours at my hometown. My shoulders are hurting, and I am a little cold. I need some extra sleep. I shouldn't have gone home this weekend and partied till the sun came up Friday and Saturday. I think I ate too much earlier, and now I am too full. Well, I know I have a lot to do tonight. I have rhetoric, calculus, this thing, and a shit load of reading to do. I took care of my pretesting last night so now I don't have to worry about it. I really need a neck and back massage. I miss talking to my grandma every night. I miss living with her too. College is a new horizon, but it is a good one though, because I am responsible for more things than I use to be. I just miss the security I think I felt in high school. If I thought back, I'm sure I would realize that high school was just as stressful back then, as college is now. But I need to relax, and just take it day by day because that is the only thing I can do if I don't want to end up living in a box on the street. I hope everything works out the way I always dreamed it would, and I hope I end up in a job that I love. I don't want to spend thirty years in a job that I hate. I would like to make some money, but that isn't everything to me. I would much rather be happy than rich. Sometimes, though, I don't think that way. I know I am spoiled rotten, at least as much as my parents can afford. And what they can't, my grandma makes up for it. It is going to be hard on me when she dies. But I am not going to think of that now, because that is in the Lord's hands, not mine. I wish Dwayne would call me. Why?  Why do I keep saying that?  Damn. That is why I am going to stay up here next weekend. If I stay up here, maybe, HOPEFULLY, I won't think about him as much. And, I will have more time to get all this work done, and catch back up. I have slacked off the past couple of days, and now I'm going to pay for it. Especially tonight, I am hoping to get caught back up. I wish I could go to bed right now. I am cold. Need to turn the thermostat down. Maybe it would save some money if I didn't keep it so cold in here all the time. But, if I didn't have wet hair right now, and had blow dried it, I wouldn't be cold. In fact, knowing me, I would be hot. Okay, my eyes are starting to hurt looking at this computer screen. I wish I had pants on, instead of shorts, then I wouldn't be cold. I wish I had turned the thermostat down before I started this stream of consciousness. I was going to major in psychology, and it seems very interesting to me, so I am glad I am taking this class. There is a guy outside doing his skateboard thing. He makes a lot of racket, and he isn't even good--and I don't know anything about skateboarding. I also wish the man above my apartment didn't stomp around all the time. He does it at like six in the morning, and eleven or twelve at night. I mean, when does this fucker sleep?  Oh, gosh, anyway, it pisses me off. If I lived upstairs I wouldn't stomp around like that. It is mean to the poor soul living downstairs. I wish I could go shopping instead of doing the homework I am going to have to do. That would be nice. I don't know if I am going to get a chance to go shopping this week. That sucks really bad. I want to buy some new tennis shoes, and some flip flops. Yeah, and go to Academy. I hope college gets easier as I get used to it more. I hope it happens soon. ",1
930,"I've been thinking a lot about this next weekend. Tryint to plan everything out so I get to see everyone. I miss home. The people, the places. My church, my room, and all the little things too. Just the familiar surroundings that make home what it is. So peaceful. So safe. One things I've found at college is that there's a void in my life that can't be filled. It won't ever be tha same. The relationships with people back home, that's the biggest void of them all. Susan, Amy, Jennifer, John, Mikey, Jeni, Ms. Betty, my parents. You can't replace that. It's always there, just sitting, empty. Sure, I can meet new people, do new things, but you can never replace a person, a relationship. They're all differnt and unique. My left arm is tired. Well, I just thought that so I figured I'd write it. And I just thought about writing about my arm. Wow!  And I JUST thought about thinking about writing about my arm. It never ends. weird. I've always been interested in how the human minds works. It's funny when you think about it. Here we are, using our minds, trying to figure out how our own minds work!  Isn't that weird?  When you think about it, where do you get yourself?  How can you come to a conclusion when the conclusion you're trying to come to, is actually the tool you're trying to come to that conclusion with?  It's impossible. An endless cirlce of thought and ideas. The human mind is a mystery, and always will be. That kind of impresses me that I came with that. Gee, I'm smart. Just kidding. Well. ten more minutes. Ok, I ;ve gone from missing home to pondering about the human mind. My shoulder hurts. Wow, I complain a lot. I'm feeling my elbow right now. It's swollen or something. I'm not sure why. I've been working out a lot so that might have something to do with it. Who knows?  It doesn't hurt, but I don't know if I should avoid straining it or what. I'm supposed to work out today. We'll see. I've been thinking about someone back home a lot. Her name is Cam and we met about a month before I left for college. There was this kind of initial attraction I guess you'd say. Kind of weird. I haven't had anything like that in a couple of years. I think it was her bright personality. She has thing kind of glow about her. She's always laughing. I like that in people, because I need to laugh more sometime. So we kind of talked about our relationship some, and I told her I didn't think it was best if we committed to anything, I mean, since I was leaving for college. She's a junior in high school. But we've kept in touch a lot. I think she wants a committment, but I don't think that's smart. But you know, there are sometimes when what is smart isn't what is right. Sometimes we have to do the irrational and just dive in without holding back. It's like faith. God doesn't always make sense to me. I hear all the time people trying to disprove God, or Christ, or the Bible, or christianity. like I'm taking this class, the Rise of Christianity, and he always tries to show flaws in the Bible or myths about the early churches, or whatever. But the fact is this:  I know what Jesus has done in my life, and nothing can change that. EVER!  What He did WAS illogical, it WAS beyond understanding, it WAS a miracle!  And NOTHING can disprove that, not science, not anything. How do people react to that then?  Well, people's final defense is usually, ""Well, then you must be crazy. ""  And if that's all they have, then I'll take that any day. Times up. Hey, I liked this assignment. I think I will enjoy this class. ",0
1301,"This semester should be one where I define the rest of my life. Working as hard as possible to get into the school of architecture. It is what I have wanted to do for the past 5 years. The fact that I was initially rejected brought me down. But I can't let that hold me down. Hopefully psychology will help me sort out my thought processes. My roommate is being very helpful right now by blurting out random words and playing decent music. I'm pretty fortunate to have a good friend like him. I have known him for the past 2 years. I am also fortunate for having good professors this semester. I don't really have a monotone stiff up on stage reciting the book word for word. I am also fortunate that the girl next to me in psychology class is hot. Hopefully something will come of it. If not there are about 20,000 other cute girls running around on this great campus. I thought this was going to be easy but so far I just can't seem to talk about much. That it was I hate about myself is that I am too shy around people I don't know. People I don know think I am loud and very extroverted but around strangers I don't know how to initiate conversation. There are times though when I don't really care and I seem to make friends with everyone. I have a lot of reading to do but I thought I might as well get this out of the way. I used to do this type of thing in my 10th grade English classes. Mr. Wildman was so cool. My old high school wasn't very good. I guess that is why I only went there for 2 years. I bet there are about 2 million mistakes in this paper once I am done typing this. The psychology textbook is pretty easy reading. That is such a relief because I need to work as hard as I ever had in my entire life and I probably couldn't do it if the books were terrible. I think that after this semester of busting my ass I t help bring me into a routine of busting my ass and making a 4. 0 over the next years will come natural. I believe that the harder you work the better the pay off. Architecture is a field of tremendous work. I have worked with a guy for the past two years. It so good. I have learned more on the job than I think I will ever learn in any classroom. It was a job I was looking forward to going to every morning. He gave me a lot of responsibility this past summer. I was able to organize the El Paso Independent School District fundraiser where I happened to meet a lot of influential people in the society. How much longer do I need to type? This is lasting longer than I thought it would. I guess my head is just empty. I think while doing this I try to hard to put on this thing that I think you want to hear. But since it is just a free thought paper I should just be able to write whatever I want. But for some reason it just isn't happening. I think way too much about things that keep me up at night. I often lie in bed until 4 in the morning just thinking I will be in the next 10 years. I have always had the dream of making it big and becoming some architect who becomes immortal thought his outstanding designs and buying my parents whatever they have always wanted. I think that making my parents proud of me is my ultimate goal in life. Just once to here my dad say, ""that's my son"" in front of a whole crowd of people and for him o be so proud of what I have become and done is the greatest thing in the world. Hopefully I went let him down that is why I come to class. That is why I have to college. This is why I am reading and turning this assignment in days early. I will do whatever needs to be done to get to the top. If I don't I have not only let myself down but my parents as well. But I won't let that happen. This is the place an time to make or break my future and I don't plan I on coming away from the university with anything less then I what I came here for. I will be the best and I will make my parents proud. Time is almost up I thin. I guess this has been good for me. Even though no one will probably ever read this I know it has been a vent. These are things no one has ever heard me say. So take car of it. Times up teach, talk to you later. ",1
1449,"Ok, I am starting writing for 20 min. My thought, are what I am writing about. Right now I am still thinking about visiting my friends at Baylor this weekend, not sure If I want to do that. I have stuff to do, got to get a new id, and eat, and some other stuff, mainly thinking about what I have to do. Most of my friends are going home for the weekend is why I am thinking about visiting Baylor. I have to be back at 5 Sunday to try out for ransom notes, so that is a factor, Also Stephanie wanted me to visit EV free Sunday morning with her, so if I do that I will want to leave Saturday afternoon, so I am not sure, I still need to read chapters in psy, chapters 3,4 in CS, chapter 2 in psy, I need to do that today, maybe after I go run, I think I will go to Baylor tonight and come back tomorrow afternoon. And get stuff done, I need to work on that song, that reminds me I need to go get those Birkenstocks as well, anyway I want to see Blake and Lauren and the game but I don't know if I will have much time, maybe I can leave in the morning tomorrow, and skip the game, come home and do some stuff, that will give me time to go and get the shorts and sandals I have been meaning to get, then I can still go out on sat night, maybe with Jacqueline or Susan, most everyone went back to see Dave, I wish I was seeing Dave, but they sold out the first weekend they were on sale and I was not in town to get them. Oh well, I can get more stuff done now,. need to sunin my hair and go running,. remember to get exenphrime, exandrine or whatever ant GNC on Tuesday, I may go run then work out a while today I want to figure out what I am doing tonight first though. Blake said something about a dance tonight, but he is dateless. So I am not sure, hmmm, what to do what to do, I need to work out defiantly this weekend. Hmmm, I wish I could see everyone, but all my friends go to diff colleges, Ashley keeps asking me to come visit her, which I should do but I am lazy, hah, I have no time for anything anymore, I squeeze in homework and studying, I need to do something about that, I would like to see Ashley though, I kind of miss her, it is a lot harder than I thought it would be to meet girls here, they are either intimidating or not worth the trouble, I guess I have just had bad luck but every single good looking girl I have started conversations with has a boyfriend, but none of them have really been good looking enough to make it worth my time to try and become better friends with them if they are in a relationship, Anne was pretty cool, but now things are weird between us, I need to get will and ryan to take me to some fiji parties, those will probably be better. I guess I will skip workout today and just go up at about 2:30 hmm, writing this didn't seem like the chore I thought would be. I just have weekend plans on my mind so I can't think of much else. Psy is fun, I need to be a little less tired Monday so I can enjoy it, I will work on that. Over and out. ",0
620,"I wonder if the more you study the easier it becomes to study for longer periods of time, like a muscle becomes used to extended strenuous activity. . I met this great looking girl at a frat party the other night(I am a kappa sig. )and I asked her to go to the rice game with me, she said she would, I went to her dorm too. she is really nice and amazingly beautiful. about thirty minutes ago I saw her going up the elevator with another guy, I wonder constantly what she thinks about me or if she does at all. Not that I'm upset a great deal or anything, I mean I hang out with girls all the time that are just friends, maybe he was like that with her. I hope so, don't mean to sound obsessed. I actually prayed last night for the first time in a long time, it felt good, I mean I believe in God very strongly even though I don't live the perfect Christian life by a long shot, sometimes I feel bad about praying because of what do (Namely drugs and partying). deep down I know that God wants me to talk to him all the time but its like facing a nun when you're stoned. (personal experience). like looking unto something that's holy (or perfect) and knowing that you're heart and soul aren't really of any comparison to theirs. I even asked God to help me ""get"" this girl I like so much. seems a bit childish in some ways, but I think he will let happen what's best for me. College has been so overwhelming so far, I just seem to keep going with what's happening in classes and my obligations to the fraternity, I think if I slowed down, and had time to think I might become a little more anxious but so far I've coped alright, I'm a pretty laid back person, not too much gets to me. the key I think to dealing with transitions like this is having good friends, I've got this girl from back home that I hang out with a lot. she is very cool and down to earth and I respect her a lot because she respects herself, and she is willing to talk about anything, sometimes more than I'm comfortable with, but she seems to know when something is into my risk side of conversation. .

495,"Although, I constantly advocate to my friends that one should make the best of everything, I failed to do so. Recently, I have noticed a drastic change in my life. Prior to the major transition of my life (college), I used to constantly worry. worry. worry. Although I still worry, I have learned to view life from another perspective. Each and every minute I must be productive, but no longer is my school work the only ""productive"" thing in my life. I realized that simply chatting with some friends or relaxing can result into a more elaborate learning experience then simply books. For instance, I was watching a movie last night (something I rarely do because I feel I am not being productive) that enhanced my knowledge of the world around me. Very few movies make me think long after I finished watching the movie, but this one did. The overall design and structure of the movie was not to great, but the plot behind the movie sparked some circuits and made me question particular aspects of life. All in all, I am trying to stress that I am still learning regardless of what I do. This certain attitude towards life has allowed me to be open-minded and not as stressed out as usual. Today, I have several things to do. My priority list is very long, but I am limited with time. It seems the more I think about how much I have to do, the less time I have to do it. I have two tests next week. Chemistry and Calculus, respectively. My weekend is going to be centered around studying for those two tests. Hopefully, my mind will allow me to concentrate on those two tests and only those two tests. Austin, or rather UT, is a very convenient campus. Opposed to my hometown, UT allows me to travel many places on foot or even by bus. This form of transportation is very tempting!  I just bought a laptop which I am very excited about. I felt rushed when I bought it, but it is too late now. I still have to buy a PC card for it so I can access the internet from my dorm. I want to designate a weekend to upgrading and buying software for my computer, but I have so many things on my mind. By the time I get around to doing so, a whole new line of computers will be on the market!!!  My life is busy, hectic, stressful, etc. But, I enjoy it!  I am confused on what organizations I should join here at UT. I am used to being a part of and active in nearly everything I am offered. Here at UT, I am unaware of everything they have to offer and therefore, not a participant in everything I want to join. I hope that I will gradually reach the peak I was at in high school. I am sure I will. I was  unaware of my surroundings a minute ago and this man was asking me a question. whoops. I believe I have reached my goal now, after reading the assignment nearly 20 times.

I hate standing up on the bus. I think it should be a rule that if you're a boy you have to stand up for girls on the bus. my first class is at 10 in the morning. I have so much to read. did I take my medicine this morning. I think. I can't believe how much I forget lately, I need to get that checked out. Sarah's team is playing us in a volleyball tournament this weekend, I should call her and see what time so I can go watch, Staci is coming in this weekend. oh, that's going to be so much fun. we should go downtown. I need money. I need a job, I wonder if I can get a job here at the apartment complex, I bet that'd lower my rent. all of a sudden I stopped capitalizing my I's . I think it makes me type faster. that's neat, I love my smell-good candle, my head hurts, how long does advil take to work, I need to go check my mail . when's our electric bill due? I'm hungry, what did I eat today. I need to buy more milk and sweet n low. I'm not going to the grocery store till sunday, oh, I have to get my film developed before monday, I should take it to one hour photo, at the grocery store. I wonder what Alexis is doing, I should go chill with her instead of reading for bio. discussion. I need to clean my room and do laundry before this weekend, oh my stomach hurts too. I wonder if I took my ulcer medicine this morning, I need to get my prescription filled. I have to go register to vote in Austin this week, or next week maybe. oh my gosh my head is killing me this sucks. oh my 20 minutes are up. ",1
485,"Towers seemed to have gotten an illness that spread very quickly last week. Only difference is everyone felt like crap for a day maybe two, I was sick for four. However, I'm feeling better so perhaps tomorrow is my last day. My mother brought some Echinacea- it's an herb that supposedly helps during the cold and flu season. I pray it does the trick. I am extremely excited about this upcoming weekend. I get to go home- Houston. Isn't that strange? You're supposed to go to college and never want to leave; here I am jumping up and down at the very thought of home. Unfortunately, the University of Texas at Austin doesn't fit like I thought it would. The university itself is awesome. My professors all seem great and the classes are interesting. The main problem exists at home- University Towers room 301. I typically refuse to stereotype- but I'll make an exception. Most people here are self-absorbed, fake, rich kids. I care more about people and their life experiences. They care more about what you drive or what your father does for a living. Oh well, at least I'm not in this alone. One of my best friends from Houston isn't content here either, except she is at ACC. My roommate, Sharon, is really sweet. (I went pot luck). She lived in Houston most her life but her dad got transferred to Holland, so she moved as well. I love hearing stories about the differences. She went to an American school so it's not like she learned Dutch, but still the opportunity was once in a lifetime. My parents moved to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil only a month ago. I was able to visit for a week early this summer and sure enough It Was Beautiful. My dad works for Houston Industries and was offered a promotion, salary increase, housing/driver paid, among other things to work in Rio. So they went to check it out and discovered it would be worth it. That's crazy to me. They are 54 years old and completely changing cultures, countries, etc. In a way I'm thrilled for them. Yet, my sadness that they're 10 hours away overcomes that. It's not all a sad story though. I have a gorgeous place to visit for Christmas vacation (there it will be spring I think) and my parents and I are going through life changes at the same time. Also, my house will still be there; my oldest brother and his wife are moving in. So I have my oh, so comfortable bed to retreat to at Thanksgiving. This is strange to me. a writing assignment that doesn't require revising and outline and spell check. Actually I like it more because I feel like I'm talking to someone. I'd much rather talk than write. English is my least favorite/worst subject. I do well in math but I don't like it. History is okay, depending if the teacher makes it exciting. Science is the best. if I weren't so crazy about dance and teaching I'd become a chemical engineer. But I believe I'd get bored of that job real quick. Well, times up. I'll sign off and go study. ",0
1151,today is good I do not have many classes I just have to get up to be in class by 930 and that really sucks I want to be with tiffany but I don't know if I can trust her I think about her all the time and although I am half to blame I don't know if the break up is all because of me I triggered it but I don't know if she wanted to break up or me break up more my Andrew is working out okay he is in class it was good that he only a friend no anything greater I mean like a best friend I can only imagine living with a best friend wanting to chop his head we would just argue about stupid stuff tiffany is so wrong I don't understand anything when it comes to her I know nothing was fair yet I wanted to believe it was what is wrong with me it is funny how things that are so important matter to no one else and although someone can have empathy they still don't understand everything is different I want to know what to do I know that is not possible it bothers me I need to do good in school I want to be someone who be comfortable I guess relying on money is what I have for now I just feel that I would be proud to support a family the way I want them to be supported but will that affect the way they are going to be brought up I want to be a good father I want to do so much but I would do nothing if I could just have some answers if I could be certain for once man I miss the old days but at the same time I do look towards the future I do think about how things will be different how I don't know what the future holds and who knows it could be good or bad I learn either way I feel I am learning a lot and changing that is what I love I want to change to a better person I guess better can only be what I hold as better not society so I guess what I am saying is that I want to be secure of myself I want to be sure I know I can figure something out I know nothing is going to be easy about it and I don't expect immediate results I just want to make something of myself but I want to have answers and I want to have love all these things confuse me and make me feel alone I have to work on them it seems everything else is so trivial so pointless I don't know though I have yet to figure out what I want my future foundations to be I am trying to be picky because it is me I think society has some things wrong of course I mean it is democracy majority wins I don't think the majority is always right although they do count for some things this topic just blows me away I mean why do people do drugs and alcohol people have many different reasons I think if everyone can be responsible and do it to enjoy themselves if it possible I think it is okay I don't know though I don't really know anyone who can but I haven't thought much of the subject I mean I particularly think that alcohol is worse then marijuana I know both are not good for your body I wonder if it therapeutic in any way though how they allow that temporary escape I know you should deal with your problems and not run and it is harmful to be trapped by hiding in substance abuse but sometimes you things take time and maybe substance abuse can be used as therapeutic I don't know maybe I am full of it sometimes I feel I know what I can handle I know there are limits to be set and I feel I can exceed some I feel everyone has there own limits and I feel those people who cannot respect there limits are the reason for the universal set of limits makes me kind of mad but that is okay of course it would happen but I wish the limits I wish I could push sometimes could be understandable although I know they can't I know what they are and if I don't that is how I find out so maybe it isn't so bad to push the limit you find out where you go overboard and you can build from that and help others then again sometimes you are only one chance and sometimes it is only luck keeping you from screwing everything up when test limits I mean everyone test limits I just feel more respect for people who know there limits I would listen to someone more I feel so clueless the universe is too much for me ,1
218,"I don't really know how to start this but I guess it really doesnÃ¯Â¿Â½t matter Computers are so frustrating. I wish I knew more about them. Its 5:25 now so I need to write until hmmmm 5:45. ThatÃ¯Â¿Â½s not to bad. I wonder what that guy keeps laughing about, It must be some really fun assignment or maybe heÃ¯Â¿Â½s on email with some girl or something. He pretty cute, kind of looks like the guy on  The Princess Bride. I love that movie , havenÃ¯Â¿Â½t seen it in a while. This assignment is kind of hard because I cant type as fast as I think. Oh, this is how this thing works. Kind of annoying You cant even see what your writing! How dumb. I wonder what Heather is writing I hope my email got to Ryan and Jeremy. That would stink if it didnÃ¯Â¿Â½t. What time is it anyway?  5:35 10 more minutes. There sure is alot of people here for a Friday afternoon. I wonder if I'll be  in here alot doing homework. Probably. I'm kind of tired. I hope gosh I'm hungry. I hope that HOPE is fun tonight. I want to meet some people . I hope David comes I wonder if Trey or Jason called. I bet Trey did for sure. I wish he was more  talkative but he's really nice. I bet Heather kind of likes Dave. I wonder if  I'm going to be able to get out of this computer without having to have that  weird guy help me again. I felt so dumb. I need to do my research requirement  soon so I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t get behind. There's a lot I need to do. That guy is laughing again. I kind of wish I could just laugh back at him. Gosh I'm a really slow typer. I hope I'm doing this right. I wish all my assignments were this easy. I need a floppy disk and oh yeah I need to get those Paradigm notes for Zoology. I bet Leann doesnÃ¯Â¿Â½t remember to bring me hers. Oh well. She's really nice. I wonder where that girl is from. She has a funny accent. I think I've written for about 20 minutes  now so I guess I'll quit even though I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t have very much typed out . I'm just slow. Besides they didnÃ¯Â¿Â½t say this had   to be a certain length just a 20 min. time frame. I wonder whatÃ¯Â¿Â½s for dinner tonight. I think I'll go find out. ",1
298,"I am so mad right now that I can't believe it. I wrote out an entire  stream of consciousness thing and I pressed cancel instead of submit which  erased my entire writing assignment!!  I am so angry and tired and I just don't feel like doing this anymore. I can't believe that I am so stupid!! Why am I doing this anyway??  It doesn't seem like it's doing any good  and I don't see what it's serving. I don't have anything to write about anymore and I don't even know If I'm doing this thing right in the first place. I don't know if I'm supposed to be pressing enter at the end of each line or if IÃ¯Â¿Â½m just supposed to write to infinity on one line or if I should press enter. I don't know. I don't think I even care right now. I'm cold too. my dorm room is always so cold. I don't know why we put the AC on so high maybe because Austin is always so freaking hot!  Why is it so hot anyway?  I hate Texas. I wish that we never moved from NJ; the weather was always so good there it was never too hot or too cold. I miss my friends too. I don't know what to do right now. or what to do when I'm done with this stupid assignment. great, I have  about fifteen more minutes left. what the hell. why is this taking so damn long sorry about the swearing but I'm just really pissed right now. I'm also tired  because I went shopping with my girlfriend today for over 7 hours and I'm  so fatigued mentally and physically. How do girls do it?  How can anyone possible walk for seven hours straight and not get tired. In that respect I completely admire them. wow. not left with anything left to say. I must have . who the hell is making so much noise in the hall way?  this dorm is always too loud!!! I just want to move to an apartment and get some privacy. I hate these public  bathrooms, they're so unsanitary. I'm having trouble breathing now. My  asthma is acting up again. probably because it's so cold in here. I wonder what my girlfriend is doing right now. She left in a hurry after she dropped me off. That's the gratitude I get for going shopping with her for so long. I bet  whoever is reading this thing is hating the fact that I can type 65 words per minute and I bet she is getting tired of reading all this crap. I'd go crazy if I have to  read ten of these things, much less over three hundred. Man I can't breath. I need to get my inhaler. I think I need to go to the bathroom too. but I can't leave this computer to do it. Oh boy. what is life getting to?  wow only ten more minutes before I am done!!  and I still don't know what to write about. Those  people sure are making a lot of noise out there in the parking lot. OH. I wonder who won the UT football game?  I guess we did since the tower is lit  up orange. but I wonder what the score was. I think I need to ask someone. Not that I actually care about football in the first place. my leg is itching why do we have so many nestle crunch bars laying around here anyway?  I think we need to give some away. ouch I just got a really big stomach ache. all of a sudden I'm really really tired. I want to get some sleep. I never get enough sleep in college seven minutes left. good. I need a haircut. I'm too tired to think. My ear canal itches now my face and shoulder itch. I can't do this anymore. I'm debating whether or not I should just submit this thing and say that I wrote for twenty minutes since I type faster than most people anyway. No one would ever be able to tell the difference. only five more minutes. I can't think of anything to write. I need to call my girlfriend but her line was busy the last time I checked. I think her roommates are on the phone line. need some sleep why the hell canÃ¯Â¿Â½t I just stop??!?!?!?   I'm so tired. My arms are getting heavy. I'm not thinking  of much anymore. can't lift my fingers. Think IÃ¯Â¿Â½ll just sit here a while and hope that time will fly by quicker. easiest thing to do is zone out and not think of anything at all, that way I won't have to type anything. but then  again here I am still typing. what the hell. I can't win either way. I need my inhaler really bad now. I can hardly breathe. only one more minute. can't think of anything to say getting really really anxious now. come on. um. I guess that's it then. I've got no more to say. ",1
1100,"I really want to sleep right now. I am so overwhelmed with everything that I just want to sleep. I just need a little bit more rest but a little bit more time. Time, there just ever isn't enough time. Not enough time to read, to sleep, or to study. Time flies. Time is precious. I think that people spend too much time wasting time. I didn't realize that until lately. You think that everyone will always just be there but they aren't. Time is so valuable. The time you spend with people is so precious and important. And I think that sometimes it takes losing some one through a death or some one moving away for you to realize that. I didn't. I would give anything right this second to talk to my grandma. Anything. Or to be able to have my best friend who is that the Naval Academy just give me a hug. But no I wasted a lot of time. But busy busy busy bee. Maybe if I wasn't so busy and didn't get so involved I would have time. But it is so hard to say no. It is hard to not get involved. Especially in college. Everybody needs you! They all want you to join their organization! There are just too many and not enough time! But you know I guess if you didn't do anything and then you would have excess time you would complain about being bored and wish that you had more stuff to do during that time. So is there ever a happy medium. I thought that when I got to college I would have more time. I didn't have to be in class all day and I don't have as much going on but I was wrong. Time is still the same here. So now when I am out of school I will have more time? Right? Why do I have the feeling that once again I will be let down and time will still be as short then? I will have more stuff to keep me busy. A job and maybe a family and then they will take up a huge amount of my time. I just need a break. I need a cruise. A trip to the Greek Isles. Now that would never be a waste of time. That would be a great way to spend my time. I could just lie there and enjoy the scenery and just take it all in. Or got to Hawaii I have always wanted to go to all the different islands there. I think that would just be a blast! There are lots of things that I have always wanted to do. I have always wanted to take belly dancing lessons, be in the Olympics, be able to sing like the women in the theaters, speak several other languages, sky dive, and much more. I wonder if anyone ever gets to do all the stuff that the have ""always wanted to do"" I wonder if there is enough time in a lifetime to do all of that?? I think that if you really wanted it you could. But I think that if you really want anything that you could. I don't like when people say they can't. I think that is just not a good word. Maybe I am just stubborn and always like I think I can I think I can! But isn't it much better going through life being like I think I can then I can't. How would that be a way to live life? What kind of fun would you have? Always thinking that it couldn't be done. I think that being optimistic is a much better way to live. That is so happy! I love it. I would much rather look on the bright side of life then be like this sucks, I hate this, I am miserable, I hate this, everyone feel sorry for me, and just be Blaaaaahhhh. That just doesn't sound like a good way to live life in my opinion. But I guess that I have just always seen the sun through the clouds. Just be happy and nice and care. That is all that I have ever wanted to do. I love to help. I think that is the greatest thing that you can ever do. Just care about someone. Does it hurt you? NO Does it take a lot of energy? NO So I guess that I just don't understand why more people don't care, and why some many people don't care. What is the point of that? You wouldn't want anyone to not care about you, so you should care for someone else. IT just makes sense to treat someone how you want to be treated. You know the Golden Rule. Well but anyways maybe people will change maybe it will just take time. Everything takes time though. But I have felt relaxed writing this. Maybe I should just write out what I am thinking more often. I kind of like this. I have no idea what I just typed but my mind is clearing. Maybe if my mind weren't so busy I would have more time?? That could be a good idea. I gave my self a great idea! Wahoo I am excited! But this does feel nice to just get all those thoughts out. I miss having my best friends to get those thoughts out to. Maybe just because my thoughts don't ever make sense to me but they could some how always just tell me what I was thinking. I mean not that they were like this is what you are thinking but more that they were like, well I can relate to that by this experience and that is when you are like YES! That is what I am talking about. That is a great feeling. When someone can help you figure out what you are thinking! Wonderful! We should do more of that helping people figure out what is on their mind. Maybe it just makes sense to them. Kind of like the whole thing how do I know that they color blue that I see is that same color blue that you see. I mean we know that we both see blue but do I see maybe your green or vise versa. Who knows? But that would be cool to know. Yeah that would. ",0
554,"Actually, I am sitting here in the library, wondering how my next four years are going to be. Am I going to excel like I did in high school? or am I going to have an exceptional amount of stress that I will not be able to handle it. I don't know. this whole college thing is so new to me. I just came back from lunch with my roommate and her friends from back home. It's funny because we just had the most bizarre conversation. I just met these guys for the first time and we were talking about how and if one can tell is he or she is in love or not. It's pretty complicated if you really think about it long enough. Sometimes when you meet someone of the opposite you're attracted to them right away. But what really attracts you to that person?  Is it the way they smile? The way they simply look at you?  what is it really?  After it's obvious that the attraction is there you have to move on to the next step. Which, for some people, is the hardest part. It's the whole approaching the person thing. You want to be yourself, but then at the same time you want to do something to impress the person. so you might comb your hair a special way or wear something new. it's the excitement that you like. It's sort of like a sandwich; the bread which is the first step, you the whole chasing thing. the meat is the relationship itself with extreme ups or extreme downs. Finally, the other slice of bread is either the break up or.  It's interesting because two individuals may be in love and might not even know it. That's the neat part I think. but how do we know. I wonder if we will ever know because how do you go about finding out. what type of experiments would you do?  ",1
1116,"Start. the question is how can I make a good grade in this class? most people are smarter than me so I have to try harder to make a better grade. I know nothing, that is all I know. I don't know what to say when I see a stranger so I do not speak. frustrated. confused. tired. lucky. healthy. homesick. lonely. but its all good ill be alright tomorrow right? fuck you big country you bitch. there are so many new people here its overwhelming. I am mute. I want to make friends but I do nothing. stupid. harmless. harmful. nice. relaxed. worked out. bored. nothing really to say to mom and dad just what I did today. can't talk about some of the other things because there is no need for them to be burdened by my troubles. but they would like to hear it anyways. maybe I will try talking to them. am I crazy? I hope so. its so much more fun to be crazy. like in catch22, which I just finished reading. its really interesting to mess with people the way yosarrian did. I miss paris. I love it and hate it but love it more than hate. everyone is connected to everything else. especially in paris. I don't know anything right? because I am from paris? I'm so sick and tired of people from Houston, Dallas, Austin, san Antonio trying to make me feel inferior and they know everything so much better than I do. but I come from a small town and know I know nothing. who is smarter now? I love the country. there is nothing like it. big city people are pop people. they are so one way and not another. all the cheerleaders dress like brittney, all the guys dress like Backstreet boys or some rapper from the east coast they wish they could be like. in the country its all different. anything goes believe it or not. everyone listens to everything. everyone can dress however the hell they want to on any day and no one think differently. that's another thing that confuses me. I'm from the country and I listen to all kinds of music. everyone I meet is pretty much into one thing and thinks the other stuff is lesser quality until I put some stuff on and they say oh I like that now. but they know more than me. jester is like Westgate. drugs are everywhere and easily obtained. you just got to know who to ask. I'm glad I ain't into that. I stick with some beer myself. its funny how beer is harder to get than drugs here and everywhere I've been. the government has their focus on the wrong areas. I don't know much about government because it was so boring to me in high school. I may not even vote in this election because I don't see a real point in it. someone else has narrowed down my options so evidently they got that far they can do the rest. I miss brother sid. it hurt me when I found out he had passed on but I didn't cry. I really liked listening to him speak in church. he had a real way with words and was very emotional. our new preacher is a lot different as was to be accepted but its still not the same. he tries to make things to complicated and show his intelligence when everyone knows you are suppose to preach on a 3rd grade level. but why is that? that's like saying hey you wont get very far in your spiritual education if you never get higher that the third grade. third grade was when I broke my ankle outside running and some black girls started laughing at me. I stayed in school the rest of the day and was tough you know, trying to act tough. I didn't cry the next year either when I really messed it up jumping on a trampoline. I cried when I couldn't play baseball though. that was when I was good at baseball. before I wanted to quit so bad and cried while I was playing. of course I had a lot of shit going on in my life then. adolescence can be a bitch. but I was lucky enough to make it through it and once I got out of my depression I haven't really been in one since. I get sad a lot and have notorious mood swings but nothing major. rosanne is a huge influence in my life. i've never heard anyone else say that. she's has a totally different approach to life. laugh at yourself in the mirror every morning. make fun of yourself before others do so they know it doesn't really bother you and they wont make fun of you for whatever. water. drink. wet. still thirsty after every drink. don't know why that is. can't get the taste of chips out of my mouth right now. taste always makes me hungry. but i've already ate so there is no need to now that I am full and don't need to eat. I wonder what lindsey is doing right now? I think I have figured her out. she likes to tell people what she thinks will sound good and never lives up to anything she tells me. but she's my friend still. my friends in paris have all moved away. I wonder what andrew is doing in Arkansas right now. he just moved the other day I think cause of crazy ass aliece. she gets weirder and weirder everyday. like stevens roommate russell. that boy is strange. he thinks he is Mr. badass and knows everything. I wonder if he knows he's a spaz. he said my car system sounded like shit. he's listened to good systems and mine is shit. first time anyone has ever told me that before. maybe its true but still I don't even know they guy that well and he's only heard one time but he knows. I'm stupid. my arms hurt. they need to be stretched. I wonder how long i've written for. my roommate likes to play videogames and turn the sound up loud. have some respect man. I don't do stuff like that to him. I'm glad everyone isn't like me. then id feel different. have you ever thought of life as a cartoon or wished you could do stuff in cartoons? it makes it much more interesting. it also makes me more creative I think. or crazier. but I like doing it anyways. I haven't had a square in 4 days now. haven't had a beer since i've been here. maybe I will but I don't really miss it. they were wrong when they said I couldn't have fun without beer. what were they thinking? what was I thinking. I wish I would meet a girl that meshed with me. but if only get my treated badly again. oh well I'm not going to change cause I know one day it'll get me the girl i've been looking for. FINISH ",1
1249,"At first when I came to UT I was really scared that I was not going to make any friends. Right away I met many people and made many acquaintances. I am not sure I have made any really good friends. I feel lonely many of the times even though I am constantly around different people. For me to feel good is to be loved and that is not happening. First of all, I have no family near me which removes that area of love. My best friend, Milan, is one who I can turn to. or so I thought. He seemed to have become distant from me than usual and I did not appreciate it. Actually it made me jealous because I need attention. So then I began to think that I might like him more than a friend. One of my good friends ended up telling him that I like him. It made things worse than before. But now he likes me and still wants to date other people. I think I really like him so this bugs me. I don't know what I should tell him. I think that he does not like me the way I like him. He told me he was going to come over today but he did not. He did not even bother to call and let me know that he was not going to come. He is probably out, clubbing or something. It was rude of him to not even give me a call. Situations such as these make we wonder if anyone really does care about me. I feel like some how I am always betrayed. Why is that? I wish I could be happy in my life. That is all that I ask for and wish for in my life. I feel like nothing really makes me happy. I am not saying I am always sad and my life sucks because this is not the case. I am just saying that sometimes I am sad and maybe sometimes I am content with my life. Content is not good enough for me. I want true happiness and not by myself but with another person. I am trying to find that happiness but it is way out of my reach. Why is that? Why me? I ask myself these questions all the time and ponder to myself. I think that in life I will never really be successful or anything because I get lonely really easily. I can't even go to the store by myself or to the grocery store. I need someone to go with me. Is that a bad thing? I think that it is because I am not very independent. I want to have someone with me all the time because I like the company. My best friend also tells me that I crave attention. I don't know about all that. Maybe I do though, who knows? School is stressful for me. There is so much studying to do and I feel like I have no time to do it. There is time though but I don't like to be alone. And to study you need to be alone to really get things done right. I guess I just need to figure out my stuff and then everything will be ok. Hopefully all will work out best. ",0
407,"By back hurts when I sit like this and I can feel the little tendon that is inflamed. I don't really have to think about each letter that I type on the keyboard I just think about what I want to say and it goes from my mind through the fingers and into the computer. I just stopped to think about what to write about next but I don't know exactly what I'm thinking so I'll write about what I just thought. my mind is telling me that it is lunch time and my stomach is agreeing. I think that I am going to eat healthy today because I have been slacking off pretty bad. I should probably eat some of the food that my parents gave me this weekend so that my roommate doesn't eat it all. Gosh my back hurts. Damn rain. Houston has a lot of rain, probably more than Austin I think I like usstin a lot better than Houston, it is cooler here to there is not nearly as much humidity, Gosh I have a bad cough, why do I get depressed so easily I  think my problem is that I am always trying to please everybody else and not myself. I guess that is good because it is unselfish but it is my life and everybody says that life is short but see there I go listening to everybody else again. Goodness I have a cough a headache and my back is so screwed up , it sucks to go from being very active to nearly useless . My whole life has been about having fun and playing sports and now it hurts to bad just sitting here. it is amazing that I was not paralyzed, I could not imagine what it must feel like to know that you will never stand up strait or run or even walk again. that suck but I see now that my situation is not as bad as many peoples. what do I write now I wonder. I wonder how many people will be on sixth street I wonder why my nose is itching and I haven't stopped typing to scratch it . it must be a zit trying to emerge. Janel if you read this you probably think that last statement is gross but I am very frank. I wonder if I am going to do good here at UT. I wonder what song that is being played down the hall so loud. I wonder if that is. Oh well the reptilian part of my brain is telling me that I have written for twenty minutes and that I should do something else. ",0
2113,"I hear the innumerable conversations buzzing in the background. Why do I constantly attempt to erase my sentences until I get it perfect. I smell nothingness. I should be smelling the moist air of post-raining. But instead, I only hear the faint taps of water breaking. I Love College, by the way. And that weird survey you have us take, pretesting, is the most hilarious thing to experience. That survey is so subjective to what you feel at the current moment. Damn, my fingers are already cramping. Must pop now. It doesn't want to. Let's see, how was my day?  It was long. It was tiring. OU. Damn game. But it turned out to be a nice little long wait with a dear little friend. Nothing beats flirting from 8 am to daytime. Can I say tits. Oh, what the fuck. It feels nice cussing when it is clearly inappropriate to do so for a grade. But, this is what I'm thinking, and to begrudge me for following instructions repudiates the process. Whoa, I like when I talk intellectually. I like when I can say that I like talking intellectually without fear of conceit, because no one is here to judge you other than an anonymous psycho analyzer. That was a long word. Shit, only 8 gone. It feels like a space of time has gone. I miss my adorable niece. She is the absolutely most beautiful human being. I could sincerely cry at the thought of her pure sweet charm. But I won't lest I go deep into a melancholic cheer. Whoa, there I go again. You know, it took me a long time to find the website to do this assignment. There is no emphasis on the paper to reference it's significance. No highlights. No italicizing. I cannot believe how long this experiment is. I want to eat. But I really don't. It's called munchies. And I like food. It's them damn dopamine's. I tell you, for food of course. You better have gotten that play on words, or you're not an astute psychologist. Now I'm talking to someone, which makes me a what?  I really don't know. That's your job. I'm just thinking what it would be like to be on the other end of this letter. This weird letter of nonsensical discussion to a nonexistent second party. Impatience is the motif of this letter. I can't finish it. I enjoy doing this writing but nonetheless want it to end, isn't that contradictory?  That's a rhetorical question. I like psychology. It's particularly fun for a writer/slightly intellectual. I would like to minor in it. Just for the pure knowledge. Sorry, I had to answer my phone. She says, my baby, I love you,"" and I say, ""I'm typing"". She goes on asking questions, inconsequential chatting ones. She forgot to eat with her friend. Aw, poor chica. She says she felt like a dildo. Shit just happens, probably too much. ",1
1468,"After I finish this paper I'm going to go work out, then get something to eat at Jester Center. I need to get back in shape. I feel better. Then I'll finish reading from my Zen book and economics book. I hope I am not taking the same economics class I did last year at CCCC. That is going to be a big waste if it is. I can't wait to go home on Friday to see my friends and family. It's not all what is cracked up to be down here. Dallas is so much better. It bigger, better stuff to do. I just like that environment. It's ok down here. I really have not met many people. Just my roommate and a few in my dorm. Oh yeah, I almost forgot that I met a very friendly and pretty girl named Tanya today. She lives in 407 of the Towers. She told me to come by. I'm debating on going over there or not. I'm sure Brandi wouldn't like it. Obviously since we are not doing so good right now. I just don't know what to do with her. I feel like if I break up with her it is going to be a mistake. I don't know what I feel. I'm lost. I don't feel like I have the freedom to do what I want to do. Sometimes I just feel like I'm better of with out her. She would be crushed if I broke up with her since it would be like the 10th time. I feel like there is just something else out there better for me, but I never tell her that. The sight of seeing her hurt and crying makes me feel so guilty and sad. I feel so sorry for her. I lie to her all the time about my true feelings because they are so mixed right now. I feel like I'll be lost with out her, but that might be just because I was with her for so long. I am getting pretty hungry right now, but I need to work out first. There are a lot of fine girls that work out. Sometimes I wish I could hook up with one of them. Tomorrow night might be fun. I only have one class, thank god. I hate Tuesday's and Thursday's. Three classes from 812 is forever. Actually I just hate my Cal class. I can't stand sitting in those chairs they are so uncomfortable. Just two more days until I leave. I 'm getting pretty anxious about it. I can't sleep very much at night. I don't fall asleep until 2 or 3. Then I wake up very tired. I can't wait to back to sleep after classes. But then I feel like I'm pressured for time. If I sleep it takes away the time I have to study, therefore taking away my free time. So its either nap, or play. I hope my tests aren't difficult at least after I have studied well. I have this horrible fear that I am not going to do good and fail out. That is the last thing I want to happen. ",1
1308,"Sitting to write this assignment, I feel I have lots of other things to think about. When will I find time to get everything done? I still need to unpack boxes, get things organized. The days pass, and more is left unfinished. I thought I was off to a good start, but I need to find a way to organize myself so that I can meet daily goals, weekly goals, and monthly goals. My problem with procrastination is always adding unnecessary stress to my life, and if I could only stay on top of things, or work a little more each day, I would feel less stressed, with a better sense of accomplishment. What do I want to get done? I want to finish unpacking, decorate my room  that requires that tickytacky stuff, since nothing sticks on these stupid walls. Need to find more little pillows, and little desk and drawer organizers. Little stuff like that. I need to organize my pictures, decide which I want to hang up, which are best in frames, where I will display all my frames. I also have to decide which stuff I really don't need, and pack that up, and ship it home to California. I need to organize my school stuff, still buy my aerobic book, and the right edition of the Odyssey for that freshman seminar, plus get some three ring binders. I know I brought some, but have no idea where they are at the moment. It seems impossible to loose something in such a small space, but I've managed to do it quite a few times. I need to balance my checkbook, pay my cell phone bill, and call my bank about my debit card that is not working. Did I not activate it right? I know I have enough money in the bank. I don't understand what the problem is. I have to remember to get cash; I have borrowed money too much from people in the past couple of day, not because I was out of money, but because I kept forgetting to figure out the problem. Until I do, I can't get money out of the ATM machine, I'd have to go down to the bank, and get money out, or write a check for cash, or something. Still trying to figure out all this bank stuff. I wonder if that cell phone bill is right. There seem to be some unnecessary charges on it, or ones I didn't know about. Why is my mom not calling me back? I know they are busy with soccer stuff, but I left a message saying I needed to talk, and asked those questions on the answering machine, you would think she would call back immediately. Especially since she expressed so much concern recently when she didn't hear from me in only a couple days. I need to get on top of my reading, and studying. Want to find a better place to study than my room. Too many distractions, my computer, my music, my phone, my ongoing room decorating project, unpacking, the TV, email, the neighbors, the stupid smoke detector, that is low on batteries, and is constantly, constantly beeping, relentlessly. And the person on the floor above us who never stops banging on the floor, it is so annoying, between the beeping, and banging, they are enough to drive my absolutely insane. I went to the point of stuffing cotton in my ears last night to try and block out the high pitched beeping, it is so shrill, it's painful, especially terrible when you're trying to sleep. My roommate doesn't seem to mind, she can block out almost anything. I don't know how she devotes so much time to studying. I wish I could be more disciplined like that. I would be much happier with myself. But, I am having so much fun. Will study later tonight at Barnes and Noble's with Amy. We'll see how that place is for studying. It's hard not having my car, although most people have theirs. It's nice not to be the responsible driver, and to have to pay for gas parking, or worry about getting lost, the ridiculous one way streets, and no road signs hardly to help you out, but still at times it would be much easier if I had it here. Next year, I will but what car will I have? What are my parents going to decide about that? What about molly? What will she drive? Will I get my prelude? Will that be too hard on my parents? How are they handling sorority costs? Should I get a job soon, to help with all that? How are my bills going to be this month? I'm sure the long distance bill on my regular phone line will be out of control. Try to use my cell phone more, free long distance, but not sure exactly how long I have the extra minutes for. Will john go by my parents' house tonight and set up his ticket? It makes me really nervous, not quite sure why. I know he want to come, and I know he's planning on it, but I want to see him so bad, and miss him so much, I don't want to get my hopes up too high, in case things don't work out. How will things be when he comes, how will be people like him?. Will they be accepting of him? What about the whole tattoo thing and the way he dresses? I want him to bring all his long sleeved shirts and nice clothes, but I do not not want him to change for anyone, nor do I want him to change. I love him exactly the way he is, and wish there were more people like that here, but I don't want him to be uncomfortable, or other people to judge him or make him feel uncomfortable. I want everyone to like him and for him to have a good experience. Even though I know he's not coming to go to a bunch of parties, or meet a bunch of people, he'll be here to spend time with me, but I still want to take him out, take him to the game, show him how big and fun, and cool the parties are here. Definitely won't be going to any SigEp functions, I know how they are about outsider guys, especially someone like john. I could never be embarrassed of him, but it might be uncomfortable, especially if any guys give him a hard time, and then I'll feel like I brought someone who wasn't supposed to be there, like with Sean the other day. That was a really bad experience. I don't want anyone to make john feel that way. Having a car would be nice for when he comes, could pick him up from the airport, take him to cool places, the oasis, the lake, mt. whatever where the Zeta girls ate tonight. There are so many pretty, cool things, three days is not nearly enough. But, the time will be spent well, and will either make it easier than waiting until thanksgiving to see him, or make it harder, because he'll be fresh in my mind. They say out of sight, out of mind, and I believe that to be very true. Same went for mike. But, the longer I'm away, the less I think about john, and the less I truly miss him. I think the same goes for him. It doesn't seem as urgent for him to see me the way that it was when I first was here. But of course that should be expected and it was. I don't like the way some things are here. I want to get out and meet some different kinds of people, or meet nonfrat type boys, because I'm not liking the conservative style that much. It's not what I 'm used to. I definitely don't like how money and status are such an issue. It's ridiculous, it reminds me of the movies. I didn't think people like that really existed. I left California thinking I was getting away from all the selfabsorbed, selfimage, stuff, that I was really growing sick of, only to come somewhere and feel as though I'm surrounded by an even worse kind of snobbery, based on money, family name, status, having not really anything to do with how good looking you are, as is the California snob, but how much money your dad makes, or what kind of car you drive, or whether or not you buy an $800 shirt to wear to a frat party. It's all very ridiculous to me, and it makes me sad, and homesick for a place where it's really cool to be laid back and extremely casual all the time, and where you're not judged by how much money you have. I do love how the boys always hold open doors for you, and pay for everything; those are aspects I do very much enjoy. I would not want to raise my kids here, I'm not even sure now if I want to live here after college. I love a lot of things about it, and I 'm having so much fun, meeting lots of wonderful girls, the guys are a problem for me. I went to college thinking that it's funny knowing this is probably the place where I'll meet my husband. I highly doubt it at this point in time. I'd have to find a diamond in the ruff, like Becca did. It makes me miss john, Karl, Daniel, Jordan, Ryan, even so much more. It makes me miss all my guy friends, and the fun and comfort of guys who are not polite, but funny and perverted, to a certain point of course. I can't wait to see john, I wonder how things will be. I've decided to tell him how I really feel, knowing his reaction will probably not be to admit he feels the same way. I think he probably has an idea of the way I feel, I've probably hinted at it before. I do have a glimmer of hope, since he's been signing his letters with the word love, and wrote, ""love, john on the picture he drew, and he is spending at least $300 to come out and see me, which unlike all the stupid rich boys here is money that he has worked his butt off to make, doing countless hours of work, and now is throwing it all into a three day trip. It really is incredible to me. It touches me to think he would do something like that for me. I wonder what Daniel and Karl think about that, especially Daniel. What about Jordan, I wonder if mike will find out. What will he think about that? He once said, regarding the necklace and earrings from Daniel, that he would never spend that much money on a girl ever. Well, he knows john never ever has any money, never has a steady job, and mooches off of everyone else. How would he feel if he heard that john was spending every penny he had to come and see me? Maybe then he would open his eyes a little. Probably not though. I hope someone will be willing to pick john up from the airport, I know Candace won't want to miss any of her classes, for him of course I could, it doesn't look like I have any test or quizzes that Thursday or Friday. I do have a psychology test the day after he leaves. How will it be when he leaves? I wonder if I'll be really depressed. Probably, I'm probably making it harder on myself. Probably harder on both of us. ",0
2271,"ok, so I guess I just type here. for twenty minutes. Hrm interesting you know I think this will get very boring really fast. (and my roommate asks ""so you just write? anything? crazy dude"") wow. I thought at least something would come but er. Never mind. I do not know really what to write about. great and only a minute and a half into it. er. hrm, maybe write about this computer, or the fact that I do not have one yet. that sucks. in college and I have to either go to a lab or use someone else's computer while constantly I see others around on their own machines. I have a phone call! yay. my 'mentor' telling me about an event in front of ECJ. weird trying to type and talk at the same time about two completely off different things. eh. phone's off. coming on five minutes now. almost. So I was early. you know this can't all be that interesting typing for a solid twenty minutes. most of these papers must be extremely boring. unless someone goes off and just starts telling a story or something. hrm, sounds like maybe something to do. well, it all began a long time ago. well, long in the sense that they were young when it began; that time period to others may just be what they consider a few years or so. (did you know that is you try to hit tab to indent it takes you out of the typing window. very annoying I must say) (I need a name. Er, Samsung monitor, ok the character's name is Sam) Sam had been a small child when his father disappeared, therefore he had little memory of him. all he could think of was being told stories as he was falling asleep or going to the occasional trip to the park. nothing really stood out to tell him what his father was like. many others that had known his father would tell him that he was an odd person, constantly coming up with random ideas or running off to work on something new and exciting, except that no one ever knew exactly what he ran off to do. they also told him of when his father was younger; he would disappear for days on end, supposedly off camping or exploring by himself, and would return different. how different, they could not quite say, but something changed in him. , not always for the better. often he would come back slightly depressed or would remain to himself for weeks, but after time, he would return to his energetic self. (I notice I seem to misspell quite a bit and even though I try to catch and fix the word as I type it, some words do get through without my notice and I'd rather not go back and change them. Also I tend not to capitalize much when typing. this is probably due to the fact that I have grown to accustomed to writing in Word and it will capitalize certain things automatically; that and I am usually too lazy to remember to do so. ) After Sam's father disappeared the last time, his mother fell into a strange illness. there was not a doctor who they could find who could explain the sickness. it was as if something from another world. Something definitely there but not  ",0
1684,"     My sandwich tastes really good!  The pickle in it is a little too zesty, though. I don't think I'll buy those from HEB anymore. I wish I had more time to watch TV. I really miss Big Brother 3, but I really can't find enough hours in the day. It makes me sad :(  I have a latin quiz on Friday, I don't know how well I'm going to do. I have flashcards for the vocabulary words, and they seem to be helping, so I think I'm going to go back and make flashcards for all of the paradigms. That's the hard part!  The paradigms aren't very different than spanish, but they are. I get them confused sometimes. I'm upset that I went to College Station this weekend and missed church. I really wanted to go this Sunday, but instead I went to Mass with my friend at College Station. I had fun in CS, and I definitely didn't want to stay here with my roommate, but I would have rather been back for the service. Oh well, I can go on Sunday. I start my job tomorrow!!  I'm kind of nervous about that. I've never had a job before. What if I really screw up??  And what if I'm not able to get from my job to my classes on time?  On Tuesday and Thursday, I'll have no problem, but what about Friday?  I work from 9-1, and I have a class at one. on the other side of the campus. I wish I would have just told her that I'd like to go into work an hour earlier on Thursday and then I could get out of work an hour earlier on Friday morning. That would have been perfect. But oh, well. What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger. . I took the pretest for the psych experiments and it seemed like it took forever!!  I didn't think I'd ever finish it. I've only been typing for 6 minutes!!  14 more to go, lol. Does anyone actually read these things?  Like, is it ok if I stop typing for a couple of seconds to take a bit of my sandwich?  I think I'm going to, hold on. . YUMMY!!  It's good, but those darn pickles. . Oh well. what exactly are we supposed to talk about. What we see?  Or feel? or smell? or whatever. Well, I'll tell you what I see. . WAIT!  No, I'll describe my side of the room for you: on my closet door I have a movie poster of Ben Stiller's movie   Zoolander  . It has a great big, lime green Z on it and has Zoolander written at tht bottom in purple letters. It also has Ben Stiller sitting kind of funny (I'm not sure how to explain it) in front of the Z. At the top it says 3% Body fat, 1% brain activity. I've never seen Zoolander, have you?  I just liked the poster because I thought it was funny. Beside it, I have a movie poster of Orange County. It has Colin Hanks on it with oranges for eyes, and Jack Black has an orange in his mouth. Jack Black is gross. . all he did the whole movie was run around in his underwear. 10 minutes up!  Halfway done. Ok, back to my posters. The next poster I have is of Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's, my favorite movie ever. She's wearing the black dress that she wears at the beginning when she's looking at Tiffany's in the morning. Remember that dress?  She also has one of those looooong cigarette things, I'm not sure what it's called. *sigh* every girl should watch Breakfast at Tiffany's. It's the best. Another poster I have is of Rat Race. Everyone on the poster has big heads and little bodies. On the poster there's: I think his name is Breckin Meyer, he was on Clueless, too. There's also Amy Smart, Seth Green, Whoopie Goldber, some guy who's name I don't know and can't relate another movie to him, Cuba Gooding, Jr. , Jon Lovitz, and the guy who keeps falling asleep throughout the movie. He's my favorite.   I'm win-ning!    It's so funny!  Ok, I also have an Ocean's Eleven poster. It's read with white writing on it. In the front are the hotties George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon, and in the back kind of faded out are the rest of their little helpers from the movie. Beneath the title of the poster (Ocean's Eleven, hehe) It says   They're having so much fun it's illegal.   I think this is my favorite poster in my whole room. I also have a Spy Game poster on it. The only person on it is Robert Redford, and it says   It's not how you play the game. it's how the game plays you.   Very cool. What else?  Oh!  I also have a little picture, that is once again from Breakfast at Tiffany's. It has both Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard looking in the window at Tiffany's. She's wearing the same dress that she's wearing in my big poster and George is wearing a coat and pants, with a skinny tie. He has his hands in his pocket and is laughing abut something silly that Holly Golightly has said. At least, that is what I assume. I have been typing for 16 minutes and 50 seconds so that leaves me about 3 minutes left. Hmmm. . what else can be said. I have to save some describing for later, I don't want to give it all away in this first time. What will I talk about next time?  Are there ever going to be subjects for you to talk about, or will it always be like a mad journal thing?  I understand this mad journal thing, though, because what if you gave me a subject that I didn't really have much to say about. What would I say then??  So, I guess this is good, just mad journaling. . I'll think about what to say more next time, so I'll be a little more prepared and won't bore you out of your mind. 18 min. 48 seconds. . 1minute and some odd seconds left. 19 min!! woo-hoo. ok one more minute. What about this war GWB wants to have with Iraq??  Is he nuts!  That'll be 2 wars (or at least fights) that we've had while he was president. How sad. 20 seconds left. what to say, what to say. . 10 seconds. Well, I'll start my good=byes now. Goodbye!! ",0
1338,"I am a freshman at UT but it is not a new experience for me. My older brother and sister both went here and my brother is still here to help me out which is awesome for me. I see so many confused freshman everyday even though it's already the 3rd week of school and they should know where they're going but they don't. I'm just really glad that it's not me. I am really independent however so this would be a fun experience, not scary, even if I was all alone. I like to look at things as being an adventure instead of a danger. I do go home every other weekend though because my boyfriend, who happens to be my brother's best friend, goes to the Art Institute of Dallas. Dallas is where I am from although it has changed a lot since I first moved there. I can't wait until this Thursday when I can go home to see Greg, my boyfriend again. I have been in serious relationships before but never have I been so much in love. Ever since we starting dating both of us just knew that we were going to be together for the rest of our lives. I can't wait to get done with school, start my job as an elementary school teacher, and be married to the love of my life. As corny and ""Leave it to Beaver"" as that may sound, that is really what I want to do. My real life goal was always just to be a Mom and nothing else. I didn't want a ""real job"" as they're called even though being a housewife is much harder than many highranking jobs out there. But, my dad said that I was too smart to do that and that if one day I just happened to be on my own I needed a good education so that I could have a good job to support myself or my kids with. It actually never occurred to me that I wouldn't go to college until he said that. I wanted to go to college for 4 years, but I guess I was just thinking that I wouldn't have a major but still graduate somehow. I was young then and didn't quite know how this whole college thing worked yet. But, anyhow, here I am and I'm loving it. It is such a refreshing changed from high school where you feel like you are going to a prison every day where they freeze you to death and make you tired as hell. But there was really no possible way to fall asleep because it was always way too cold to relax. So it really was like torture in that it was as if they were filling you full of some sleeping agent but holding your eyelids open for 8 hours. Enough about that though, bad memories. I am here now not knowing quite what to expect. I took summer classes at a really, really easy junior college this summer and have enough credits to be a sophomore when spring semester starts. The faster I get out, the better. But I know that UT is nothing like a junior college in any way. And I also know that no matter how easy a class seems during lecture, the tests are always hard and are nothing to take lightly. Which is good because if this school was easy, I wouldn't learn anything that I would remember longer than the test. But, it also puts a hamper on some of those freshman who expect it to be like high school. They go out on weeknights and party and don't get home until the next morning and then get up for class 3 hours later. And maybe they could pull that in high school and get away with it, or maybe they never did that in high school and are just experimenting with their new found freedom. Either way, they are going to get a big slap in the face when their first test rolls around. But that is their problem and not mine, although life would be much kinder to them if they would have learned that during high school. ",1
886,"I'm stressed out about my Calculus class I don't know if I'm going to be able to finish all the homework and be able to get an A in the class. I really want to make an A because that would increase my prospects at getting a good first job, of course that would only be good for a first job. I really don't like my job at HEB it is really annoying, all people seem to be in a bad mood all the time and I don't find it that enjoyable. If I were somehow rewarded with more money I think it might be managable however, because I can't seem to get a raise out of them I'm going to look for another job. I hope my typing doesn't wake up my roomate my girlfriend is really distressed about our relationship I guess I'll have to write her an e-mail and make things better between us. How I would describe love right now, I've always thought that you had different degrees of love throughout your life, I would say that I love her however. i really hope my roommate is a deeper sleeper than I think he is because I know I would be annoyed if he were typing where I could hear it. Tommorrow I have to go get my Economics book in the morning and read part of that, college seems so stressful, I don't know if I'm going to be able to budget my time. The bookstores rip you off you pay all that money for books and then they buy them back cheaply and then sell them for the same price that you bought them for. That might be a good way to make some money buy opening a bookstore. My dad was telling me how having a low overhead would produce a lot of profits for something on the internet. I had better be quiet so my roomate doesn't hear me, but the noises in the hall are louder but not constent. He has too wake up at 7:00 in the morning to go to class. I don't know how well we are getting along, I guess he is an ok roommate but I wanted him to be a little more outgoing. I guess I'm going to have to meet people on my own which I'm not all that good at but I guess I'll have to try. I need to find out what my rights are in this room and if I'm able to type till just 12:00 or if I can type and make noise till one. I'm willing to try and make it as comfortable for him as I can because I want to fit in with him, but I don't know if I should draw any lines or not. I have all this homework and I don't know what to do about my time management. He just got up was it my fault or did he get up on his own, I don't want to intrude on his space but where does mine come in. I really like my computer it has everything I want it to have, but the company I ordered my graphics card for went out of business where am I going to get another graphics card. I wonder what else I'm going to have to do for homework, I hope it will be easy. I want to graduate early but can I do it or am I going to have to go all four years, if I graduate early I might have some money left for a car, I would really like a corvette but the insurance on them is so expensive especially until I'm 25. I don't know if I can handle doing all this stuff and do my homework as well, with my girlfriend and friends and still have time to work on the weekends time is suck a valuable asset. what else do I have to do.

1325,"I have to go to the SI unit and then the Crew meeting and come home, shower, get ready, and meet Ann and Chad for dinner. I should have some time tonight to do homework. I'm still tired from last night, maybe I can take a nap sometime today. Otherwise, I can always sleep in tomorrow. Having only afternoon classes will be interesting. My lab might be hard because it's at night, but it seems really lax. It's such a difference from the chem labs. I'm so glad it doesn't seem hard at all. I hope my physics lab is easy as well. One can only hope. Not having lab the first week is nice. It worked out well so I could be home to help my parents help move our stuff. It's such a pain to have to move when school is already in session. I'm a little shocked the manager didn't have us sign the lease before we moved in. I hope that's not an indication of how much she cares about the renters. At least there's a lady downstairs who has lived here for 20 years that knows everything about this place. It's so nice having an apartment right next to a bus stop. I think it's fate we moved in here. After all the hassles we've had it looks like its going to be worth it. I still have to hang up all my clothes, but everything else is done. I can't forget to meet Dan at 10am on Monday in the PCL to work on physics homework. It's 6 pages long. I hope it's as easy as the first homework. It still took a while to finish though. From 7pm to 1am. This time I'll start earlier. I'm glad that my sister is coming in town, but she picked a bad weekend. I have a lot of reading to do and 2 tests to study for. I need to start seriously studying the PCAT. I can't believe I almost missed the deadline on that again. This is ridiculous. I hope I get into UT Austin. That's the only place I'd really like to go. Except maybe UCSF or University of Washington. UCSF is probably too expensive. I'd want to live in San Fran when I have money so really I only want to got o Pharmacy school in Austin or Seattle. The only thing about Seattle is I hope Sylvia has gotten cleaner. I know she never cooks anymore, so probably. We'd have to get a bigger place than what she has now and I might just have to leave all my stuff here and buy new stuff. That's going to be expensive. I hope whatever happens, Mom and Dad aren't disappointed in me. They need a web page for PAC so I know when I need to get in line and for what. The draw system for the football team is so much more efficient, even though they don't give out all the information I need either. Maybe next year I won't buy either. It's so much of a pain. I don't even feel like going. I bet that's how they make their money. I don't know about the plays, but at the games students get crappy seats. I know they were trying to improve that, I wonder if that went through. Probably not. As a whole, UT just cares about money and not the poor students. That's why alumni get everything. Good luck to the ""sick"" staff. ",1
862,"It is just past one a. m. and I feel like doing this now. I'm not really tired and know that I should go to bed because I have to go to class at eight tomorrow. I've done all of my homework and am extremely bored. I just got off the internet with my boyfriend back at home, which would be Conroe. He's lonley just like me and we have been talking for about three hours. I miss him a lot and don't quite know what to do. I really don't have a lot of friends here. I had seven best friends that I grew up with since around fourth grade and all seven of them went to A&M. I really feel left out. They all e-mail me and tell me what a great time they are having and I wish I were with them. I've wanted to come here since I was in fifth grade though, so this is a dream come true for me. I just wish I had someone to talk to. They were always there for me and we always had a great time. I also miss my family, which is probably to be expected in the first weeks of college. My brother called me today, he is 13, and told me that he just got a new dwarf hamster and I know he got it just because I told him last week that they were the cutest things. He takes everything I say to heart, even if he dosen't know it. My mom's and my brother's birthday is in a week and I'm not sure if I can get home. I wasen't able to bring my car up here so I'm stuck at the mercy of my roommate. I just want to be there for their birthday's. If my roommate dosen't go home though then I'm stuck up here. I've known Sara for quite a long time. For about eight years. We've never really been best friends or anything but we decided to room together because we knew we could trust each other. She is pretty neat, although she does complain a lot. I have really nothing against here though. I'm kinda hungry, if you would like to know that. Instead of eating dinner I went down the hall and watched the MTV music awards and ate candy and popcorn and I'm still hungry. I don't want to have to get up in the morning. When I scheduled my classes I should not have put four classes in one day, but I had no choice. I'm really regretting it now though. Homework is hard to do if it all has to be done on the same day. I'm also taking an aerobics class and it is quite fun. I never expected it to be so physical though. I know you are supposed to exercise and all, it's just that it hurts. I am so out of shape and it just makes me aware of that fact. My eyes are getting all fuzzy. And it is very cold. I'm getting tired now and I think it is because of all the blue writing on the white background. I wasen't tired before. So, my twenty minutes is almost up and I might go to bed now. I doubt it, I am a night person. I'd rather stay up all night and sleep all day. That would be great. Well, I'll talk to you in the next writing assignment. ",0
111,"this is the second time I am doing thin assignment. I checked to day and my social security number had no 1 or 2 by it so here I am. I am watching tv the news actually and they are giving the weather and my tummy is full because I just ate corn and chicken mmmmmm that was good now I feel tight and warm a little. it a good feeling. my ear itches. oh todayÃ¯Â¿Â½s lecturer was GREAT well all the lecturers are great but the reading is dead I mean dead I need to really concentrate on the reading. my  girl friend is laughing at me because I have set my schedule book with all the things I have to do and on Mondays I have a poetry class and I have a lot to read and write for that class so for the first few Mondays I was writing everything I had to do but I got tired of doing that so I began writing ""shit loads""  my head itches and so dose my leg man how could that guy rape a 55 year old woman he was really fucked up. now the flowers are going away for Diana. anyway mars is coming into view. did you know that the song from 2001 a space odyssey the song in the begging I forgot its name and the composer but he composed that song after reading nietczhe. pretty neat huh? well I think my time is also most up there are no more tickets left for the big game. I don't like football unless it is soccer. far and few between are my thoughts. mmmmm what do you write when you don't want to do this and when there is a distracting tv girlfriend work and my Chihuahua well that is it twenty minutes good by good sirs and madams!!!!

2136,"Ok well here I am sitting in my dorm room trying to finish this assignment. Earlier today I had called the student financial aid services because all of my financial aid hasn't come through yet. But now they said it should be getting here anytime soon. And one more thing I still need to do is go get a book for my government class because earlier in the week, they had said that it had been ordered although it wasn't there yet. So I'm probably going to have to go later on today. Then my roommate is going to the football game tomorrow morning. I still don't have a sports package and I didn't buy a ticket so this time I won't be seeing the game. I have a paper due for government on monday concerning my political views and where I come from and who or what has influenced me to think that way. I'm still unsure as to what exactly I will be saying. I just have a couple of ideas written down in a piece of paper. Oh man, yesterday some friends and I went to go work out and for some reason my legs are kind of sore right now. We're probably going again today, but who knows. I'm starting to get a little hungry now, I ate breakfast this morning but I'm getting hungry again. Oh I almost forgot, today is my friend's birthday, I need to call him after I finish this assignment. He is back at my hometown, El Paso, but I'm still calling him to wish him a happy birthday. For some strange reason our room always gets real cold. And then our neighbors have the little thing to control the air conditioner but supposedly they can't move it unless we fill in some sort of request. And then other people down the hall complain that it's too hot in their room. I don't know but whatever. My board here in the room looks kinda plain right now. I was initially going to put up some posters a while back, but I ended up doing other stuff and then I would get lazy, so till now the board still looks bare. All I have is one poster on one of the walls here to my right. And then the curtains we put up kept falling at the beginning but we finally got them to stay. All I need now is to actually get the other pictures I wanted to put up already. Oh and then there's my calendar on the wall too, but that's about it. I'm definitely going to finish that this weekend. Last night our neighbors were making a lot of noise and I just couldn't fall asleep. Soon enough I did though. And then I had to wake up early because I have an eight o' clock class, but I managed to do it. So now I'm just here waiting for my roommate to get back from work because we need to go to the store and I need to get a book. Then she said she wanted to buy some jersey for the game on saturday. While I'll be sleeping in, she will be at the game. she can later tell me how the game went, because last time it was raining, hopefully it won't rain again. Now I'm a bit thirsty, I think I'm going to go get myself something to drink from downstairs. Ok that was all for my 20 minutes. finished. ",1
2090,"I have no clue how to start this. I haven't bought my psychology book yet. Is that bad? I wish I could do that DJ thing at the beginning of class. The guy last time played horrible music. I made a friend in that class named Kelly. She seems cool. I hope we get to hang out. This feels like a diary entry. Is that what it's supposed to be like?  Today Natalie and I went down to a free barbecue thing and met some new people. One girl we met reminded my of my ex-boyfriends new girlfriend. It really got on my nerves. Not because I'm jealous, just because it was like her twin and being around that was just an odd situation. Rob is really annoying me. I'd like to just stop talking to him altogether. But hang out with him at the same time. And Eric. I don't know what to do with Eric. I don't know if I love him or not. I don't know if I'll ever really be in love. He says the sweetest things to me, so it's easy for  me to say sweet things back to him. But I don't know if I really feel it or not. I think I'm really heartless. And I haven't been in English for a long time! I'm forgetting whether to capitalize the I"" in some words. Odd. My arm hurts. Am I going to have to keep this up for 20 minutes? I wonder if some people write really poetic things in their stream of consciousness writings. Mine is all boring teenage bullshit. Let's try and write something deep. It's quiet in the dorm hall, save the occasional dorm slam. All the girls are in their rooms, wasting tears on heartless boys and wasting brain cells on pointless worksheets. The faint shimmer of hope of the future they saw on the first day of college has almost completely faded, all in a couple of days. Soon those heartless boys will do something so horrendous, and the girls trust in men will be shattered for good and ruin all relationships in the future. Aaaand I'm spent. That was so lame. Bullshit, as my English teacher would say. He is really cool. He made us write about a chair the other day, which was very interesting. And he taught at Pomona, which is my Harvard. I would love to go to school in California. Hopefully next year I can go to SFSU and be near Eric and see if this thing will really work out. Are boys the only thing on my mind? Am I really that shallow? At this moment, I'm afraid so. I blanked. I have to start a new stream. I'm losing a lot of weight, I think. My wrists are smaller than they used to be. I don't know why that waifish look appeals to me. I want to be super skinny. And if not eating is how I have to get there, I just might do it. I don't think I'm fat right now. There are just parts of me that could be smaller. And I'm too lazy to work out, so not eating will solve all of these problem areas. I'll be the anorexic that always eats Milky Way. Because those are so good and I could never give them up. When do I become an adult? I have no clue where that came from. But really. When? It's really quiet in here. I can hear Natalie typing on occasion. She is a good student. Always on top of things. Our room smells like new carpet when you first walk in. The other day it smelled like Clam Chowder. Not pleasant. I miss my family. I never thought I would. I don't miss them so much that I'd cry or be terribly homesick. I mainly miss the meals. And the fact that if I was sick they would go and buy me what I needed. I took birth control for the first time on Friday and it made me sick and there was no one to take care of me. It made me appreciate my mom so much more, which I rarely do. Yes, I am a spoiled brat. I didn't get as much stuff as other brats did, but I am one nonetheless. And I have no concept of money because I am willing to shell out another couple hundred bucks in October to go see Eric again. And my mom will be furious at me if she finds out. I'm not going to tell her this time. I'll give Natalie all the information. And pray my parents don't come down for a surprise visit. I like our dorm room. It has a lot of character. I love our posters. Natalie and I have the same tastes in a lot of things. Of course, I'd much rather have my best friend Monica as a roommate. I miss her so much. And with her, I do miss her to tears. She is the only one I could be myself around. I love her so much. And feel horrible about what I did to her last year. I blew her off. I wasn't a good friend. And I'll never forgive myself for it. The girls across the hall from us just got home. I don't like them that much. Jenny is nice. She listens to Morrissey. And, however stereotypical that is, we think she is gay because of that. Most Morrissey girls are lesbians. And Paige, the other girl, is really stuck-up. And she listens to lots of local bands from Dallas that I despise. So yes. It takes a lot for me to warm-up to people. I'm very selective with friends. Which I shouldn't be because I'm not the coolest person to hang out with. And boy do I have low self-esteem. I constantly put myself down. Eric gets annoyed with it. And I type really hard, too. I think Natalie is annoyed with this sound right now. Oh well. Seriously, is someone going to read this? Is there a right or wrong way to do it? I hope not. I'm sure I'm doing it the wrong way. Rob just told me that he is joining the army. I don't want him to. And I told him why. And he told me not to be punk rock because I'm an indie princess. That's so lame. Just because I listen to that kind of music doesn't mean I can't have political views. And this was a good exercise. Very therapeutic. Thank you, Professor! ",0
705,"I'm so confused and overwhelmed right now. Between school (hard classes, lots of homework and many hours), and sorority stuff (meetings or at least something every single night and weekend), and problems with my boyfrined (we're on the verge of breaking up), I don't have time to do anything fun or relaxing. It seems like I'm always going and I don't have time to stop and breathe, and evertyhing  conflicts with everthing and I'm having to miss so many things for all my differnt things I'm involved in. Things wouldn't seem so miserable to me right now if it wernen't for my guy problems, too. I really wanted the whole long distance thing to work out and it seemed like it was, but we are both so busy that neither of us ever have time to go visit the other one and we both hate being so far away and never getting the chance to visit each other bc of our damn busy schedules. I am always so tired and stressed and never get a chance to sit and rest. I have to plan my whole day, down to when I have time ot eat and shower, every morning the second I wake up. Even though I'm complaining a lot, I LOVE sorority life, I LOVE UT, I LOVE all the frineds I have made, and all the things that are going on every night and every weekend, it is just so stressful bc I can't do everything at once. I'm not even real sure what I'm supposed to be writing about or anything, but all I can think abot right now is my guy problmes. Me and my boyfrined got in a huge fight tonight, so big that I threw my phone and broke it, which I usually never get mad or violent. But we both think that the other one is being so selfish to not be making time for the other one, but we are both in the same boat when it comes to our busy schedules. I don't know what to do, and this is all that is on my mind bc he means the world to me, and I don't know what I would do if we broke up, but I'm just so confused and don't know what to tell him or what I should do about this whole thing. I wish I could just take off from school and everthing and drive away and go see him for the weekend and work things out. I really don't know what else to say, I am rambling now evertying that pops into my mind. I really am having a great time down here asides from my crazy hellish schedule. I miss a lot of my frineds too. And it is so hard to get studying done here at the dorm with all my friends around all the time, with my radio and tv going, my phone ringing off the hook, my computer sitting right here tempting me to get on Instant Messenger and chat with all my friends. I'm just stressed, that's all there is to it, I hate feelign like this too, bc there is really nothing I can do about it, there is nothing I can get out of that I want to get out of. I am really hoping that things will just slow down and life will get to what I consider normal. That would be awesome. I don't know if that will happen and when it will if it does, but I'm really looking forward to that. ",0
839,"so I'm suppose to be writing my thoughts at the current moment. hm, strangely enough, I don't have any and usually my head is swarming with random ideas and daydreams. well, now that I think about it, I guess right now my thoughts are so scattered that I can't exactly grasp onto one idea. my friend called while I was in bio class earlier. stupid me forgot to turn off my phone before I went into the class, so imagine the embarrassment when my phone rang in a deathly quiet lecture hall. I quickly checked the caller id and turned off the phone, not wanting to upset my professor. typically, I'm told, it's not good to piss off the professor during the first day of class. but man, my heart raced after that. I don't know why either. but for about 5 min, I couldn't write; my hand was shaking so bad. so right now, I'm thinking I should call my friend back, but seeing as how I still have about 15 min left to write, I guess I can do that later. speaking of later, I'm still waiting for a phone call from my friend ruby so that we can go work out later. we went earlier this morning, right before lunch, but we had to stop short because I had class and all. we worked out for about an hour, and yet, that was definitely not enough. I never imagined that working out took so long. I'm terrified about the so-called freshman 15 that I want to do as much exercise as possible. it seems like I have so much free time on my hands, since I only have class for about 2-3 hours each day, and yet, I'm still rushing around trying to get everything done. it's funny how time speeds up when you're at college. I still have yet to practice piano here. and I have a billion other things to do, and yet, for some reason, I'm really bored now. my time management skills have definitely got to improve. fast. I also push myself to do something every single minute of the day, because once I start getting bored, then I get really depressed and start missing home. I never thought that would happen because I really hate port lavaca. it was so boring there. man, I'm just filled with surprises. I'm really looking forward to seeing my friend tonight. I can't wait. all my thoughts eventually drift back to him. I've managed to suppress my thoughts about him for about 10 min now. whew, that was really tough work, I must say. we don't see each other all that much during the day, mainly because he's busy, I'm busy, we're all busy. but I guess it's good. we need to lead our own lives, so in case things between us break apart, I won't be totally crushed. like the last time. I learned my lesson quite well. but still, I can't wait to see him. it kinda sucks living at jester without a car. sure I know a lot of people with cars and all, but that's different. I don't want to bother them with taking me places. I had my roommate take me to walmart today and I felt sooooo bad when we came back. I dunno, I just feel like a burden when I don't have a car. I guess I could always call up my bro but he lives about 10 min away and parking on this campus sucks. and usually when I go visit my friend, I get him to pick me up since he lives on the other side of campus and then some. but doing that every day is going to get quite tedious. I'm going to have to find another mode of transportation. I still have to figure out how the buses run too. I'm scared to ride the buses tho. I'm scared that I'll take the wrong one and end up on the 5th ward of austin. I wish I had my car. I've met some new people here, hung out with a lot of old friends too. but yet, I still feel very lonely. I mean, I'm starting to get to know my bro's friends but it's kinda not the same when everyone knows each other so well, and then this newcomer comes and tries to fit in. I guess a lot of freshman go through the same thing. I dunno. maybe it's just me. and wow, this 20 min went by really fast. I have about 4 min left. ok, so what was I saying? o yea, I think tonight I'm going to see my friend. (I told you my thoughts keep drifting back to him) it's his birthday today and his roomies are throwing him a special party, entertainment included. I don't really care about that. and surprisingly enough, I don't even care if he has a bunch of friends that are girls. I guess I'm just in a whatever mode. don't want to get too attached again. but on the other hand, maybe I'm finally beginning to trust him. I guess I'll find out later if that's going to be a huge mistake. I really like writing, esp like this. just random thoughts. I brought up my journal so that when I'm feeling some realy intense emotions, I can just write my little heart out. but that's usually only when I'm really feeling strongly about something. usually when I'm going through one of my personal traumas. ok, time's up. this has truly been fun. truly.

472,"I come from a small town of 5,ooo people and everyone knows your business. I have 4 sisters and 0 brothers. I am the 2nd to the youngest person of all 5 girls. All 3 of my older sisters are married  except for my youngest one. She is only in the 6th grade. My father is a elementary school teacher and my mother is a pharmacist technician. I love my parents to death and they have been for me continuously. I respect with all that I have to offer and much more. I hope to do well in school, not only for myself but for them as well. I hope to go to medical school one day and eventually be doctor. I have high expectations of myself and I hope to accomplish all of my goals. I know that I am the only one that can mess up my life and my goals. I have this roommate, and I worry about him every now and then. He seems to know what he wants but, he keeps on screwing up. I have this friend who has to do homework. She would have been done by now but  she is a huge procrastinator. I can be like that too, but I work better under pressure. A lot of people tell me that I do not have common sense, but I really don't give, because I don't care. As you can see, I am writing whatever is coming to my mind. I wish I could just type the same word over and over again. For example,---- say etc. Sometimes I wonder what the world will be like in about 20 years. if it is even going to be here or if we are not. Huh. About what. Oh man hey one of you'll do me a favor, nah I need a big favor. I am not going to pull your finger. No for real I need you'll to do me  a favor. It depends. Will you'll go pick up Erica?  Yah, if you give me few bucks. Well, I really don't know what to type anymore, I have been typing a whole bunch of crud and now my twenty minutes are up or at least almost up. I have paused for a while, but that is only because it is hard just writing what ever comes to your mind. so I won't lie, but It has been an experience. ",1
1553,"     My thoughts and feelings-- most of what graces my thoughts and feelings these days are boys. Yes, i'm still in high school, I might add. I have been screwed by boys. All of them in fact. Please just let me tell you about the not calling about the not buying me flowers and the not recognising me for the princess that I am. I guess you could call me high maintenance. And yes you would be correct in assuming so. But I definately deserve to be treated like a princess. End of story. Nothing else to it-- treat me like I'm a princess and I'm as good as yours. . well not really but it goes something like that. My mom taught me how to be a princess, yes, I was taught by the queen herself, Queen Mom. My Queen Mom is sick right now. with pneumonia (don't ask me how to spell it because I don't know and I guess I don't care because you don't see me looking for a dictionary, now do you?)  But anywho, she's really sick and also just happens to be moving to Arizona in two days-- go figure. So she's sick as a dog and I get to pack for her, bring her water, bring her wet washcloths, bring her advil, bring her anything her little heart desires-- as for me?  I'm not the princess when I'm at home-- maybe Cinderella, but as for now, my sick mom is occupying all my time, well at least a little of it, but who doesn't like to be taken care of?  Thus the practice of princessism!  Where's the 'king' you might ask-- well he's in Arizona, (which of course would be the new kingdom. ) making the money so that my mom and I can spend it all on things that we want and really don't need-- he's a really sweet guy. They all say that you 'marry your father' and I would love to get a guy that's as sweet as he is, but I just really don't think that one exists. So this little princess metaphor is really working for me!  I just cannot wait to get married. I think about that a lot too!  Well, not actually being married, but GETTING married-- my wedding!  Every time I go to a wedding or see a wedding dress or blah blah blah. it just gets me all excited!  I can't wait to dress up all pretty and have everyone look at me and say how beautiful I am. ahhh, it's great to think about!  Well I guess that those are probably the only two things that I ever think about-- well except for classes sometimes, oh and being grossly skinny, that would be fun for about a day. I would hate to be skinny forever, that would be terrible, but you want to hear terrible?  Every guy that I've ever dated has been skinnier than me. Now I'm not fat, I'm just not skinny and the guys that I date ARE!  Also, every guy I've dated has also cheated on me, isn't that great for my self esteem?  I really think so, because now every guy I see I'm thinking 'hyyyyaaaaah!  I want to beat the snot out of you!!  I want to karate chop your face until your eyes bleed!! ahhh!!'  . And that's every guy I see, so I'm thinking that a whole bunch too. I guess I think of 3 different things now. Because before it was only two, but then I remembered how much I hated guys and I got to thinking 'well I guess I think about that a lot too'  Maybe I'm not so boring after all. . Just kidding, I really feel like I sound terribly superficial-- I think about other things, but my brain has been so full of bullshit lately that there's not room for much else that won't just be covered in the bullshit of my mind as well. case in point. I guess that's my excuse for not thinking, even though it's really hard for me not to be thinking about something all the time-- that's what's wrong with culture today-- we're always so busy doing something and once there's nothing to do, we're 'bored'  but why is that?  How can we be bored when we always complain about being too busy. wouldn't you think that we'd welcome this so- called 'boredom'??  I think we should. I was bored about 17 minutes ago so I decided to do my writing assignment, and here I am!!  I guess it feels good to vent things, but I probably wouldn't do it unless it was an assignment-- it's good to see my mind on paper even though it's not really paper, it's a screen, but same difference, work with me here, stop being so complicated. Please let me tell you how much I love to sing. . and at the same time I'll tell you that I'm no good because I am, but still, how cool would it be to be the lead singer of a band?  My current official 'non- boyfriend' right now (I broke up with him 4 days ago) is in a band and they're looking for a singer, but I know that he would never want me to sing because he's heard me sing, and well I guess I won't sing in THAT band, but oh well, well that's all I have to say about that.

565,"I lost interest of the situation but after a whole summer of not talking to her I started to miss her. I had attempted to email her but she never responded, I guessed that she was mad at me. I have emailed her 6 times with no reply but I am a persistent bastard so finally today, in fact just before I opened this page I decided to check my email as I do every day and there was her email. it explained that she had not checked her email all summer, it may not be true but it works for me. I proceeded to write her back thereby postponing this assignment around 10 minutes. I will eagerly await her reply as I basically demanded to see her. We'll see if she accepts. I never checked to see when I started this but I will keep on writing until I run out of shit to say. I assume that cursing is not a problem, I understand that this is a class full of naive little freshmen but I think we are all mature enough to hear such profanities, don't worry I wont go pornographic or anything but the instructions were to write what was on my mind and I am an avid cusser so I hope this will do (that is if anyone actually reads this masterpiece of stream of conciousness writing). now I am running out of things to say.

2397,"What an evening!  I have every bad event that has taken place tonight on my mind right now because now I am in the worst mood. I went with my suitemate to pick up food from Taco Cabana. Everything was going good, but then we had to wait forever for our food. Then when we got to the window, we had to send her drink back because it was the wrong size. Finally, we got our food, and it was right. We drove back to our dorm. The Castilian has a very strange structure that they call their parking garage. I park on the end of the row, and it is almost impossible to get in to. After ten minutes, I finally got my car in my assigned spot. When we were getting out, she grabbed the food and I grabbed the two drinks. We had to wait forever forever for the parking garage elevator. FInally, it came and we headed up to our room. I stacked the two drinks on top of eachother and supported them with my chin as I attempted to unlock my door. As I was doing this, I even heard my suitemate offer to hold the drinks while I opened the door, but I just ignored because I thought I had them. I made it in the door successfully, but as I was going to set them down, I dropped both of them all over my area rug. Irate, I bent over to pick up all of the ice on the floor and I screamed how much I really wanted a soda since I haven't had one all week!  I knew I had to get my rug washed otherwise it would be stained. I proceeded to head down to the laundry room but realized I had forgotten the detergent. All the while, keeping in my mind that my food was upstairs getting cold. When I walked in to the laundry room, I whacked my hip bone on the door knob, and even as I type this, I can feel the bruise forming. I kept walking towards the washing machines and didn't notice a puddle of water on the floor. I slipped 3 times before making it to the machine. I was so mad by this time that I just decided to wash my rug without any detergent. Now, here I am sitting in my room so pissed about all the events. I get back in my room and the internet is not working!!  I realize that I am so sick of fighting with the Apogee people that run our internet connections in our dorm. So now, here I am eating the soggy nachos that I paid 6 bucks for. All I can smell is the food, but now I'm really not hungry. You should hear the neighbors across the hall making the situation all the more worse. Their TV or radio is really loud and I can hear it from here. Oh geez, now they're knocking on my door. ""Is your internet working?""  It just came back up a few minutes ago is what I told them. For a day that was going too good, it has now taken a turn for the worst. Now I am thinking about the phone call I just made to my mom a little bit ago after all the excitement. She did not offer me ANY words of advice!  ""Things happen!"" she said. Wow!  No kidding!!  I don't think anything else can go wrong, unless my internet decides to cut off while I am writing this. I look around my room and all I can see is a big mess!  As of right now, an optimistic attitude is way out of the question!  I'm seeing my WET school books on the ground as a result of the tumbling tower of drinks. WOW!! I think this is the worst mood I've ever been in!  My room is freezing, my floor is wet, my rug is down in the dryer (which I have to go get in an hour--great!), and my neighbors are a pain in the rear. My suitemate is playing sad music really loud and it is drifting in to my room. It is reminding me of an ex-boyfriend that I have back home!  He acts so funny sometimes. He thinks he is so hard to get when I know that when I go down there, he will come right back to me. He's been acting like such a jerk to me lately along with all the other losers that live back home. I was supposed to try to get a lot of things done on the internet tonight, as far as classes, and now I am completely set back. Nursing homework, psych writing assignment, and retrieving bio notes were just a few of many things that I was supposed to do. My stomach is growling because I am so mad. It gets like this when things go wrong. I HATE WHEN THINGS GO WRONG!!  My mom's words are ringing in my ears. ""Things Happen!""  ""I just got done telling dad how good of a mood you sounded in when I talked to you earlier!""  THen come my suitemate's words. ""Chill out girl!  It's going to be alright!""  I don't think that will EVER happen at this rate! ",1
1033,"I have been asked to do this psychology assignment of writing down my train of thoughts and feelings for twenty minutes with out stopping. So far that was my first train of thought  I know it's a boring intro sentence, but yet I'm not allowed to stop and think of how to write more eloquently. I guess that leads me to my next thought  school. This is my first semester at college and there is so much going on. When you asked to write down our stress factor on a scale of 17, I believe I might have marked an 8. There are so many things that are going on, and I want to be able to organize everything in time slots. The only thing is that they keep giving me stuff to do. I suppose you would define ""they"" as professors with homework and S. I meetings, which I really want to attend. Then I had my first sorority meeting last night, and they have so much in store for us this semester. I suppose I should tell you that I love going home  not to see my family (will, sort of that too  you got to love mom and dad!), but I have boyfriend back at Houston. I was planning on going home all these weekends, but it turns out that I have something I have to do that is mandatory on almost every weekend. This boyfriend of mine is totally worth the trouble and stress of going home. I have had the most amazing summer with him just hanging out and doing fun activities. He makes me feel ten times happier when I'm around him and it's just really hard not having him here to help me adjust into this new life style. I do however, talk to him everyday and write him letters. The first week I arrived in Austin, I can honestly say that it sucked because rush drained a lot out of me and then we had to start school with no breaks from rush week. I thought I would be able to adjust better in this big place, because I consider myself an easy going friendly person. There is just so much that is consuming my life right now that I hardly have time to stop and think about what I need to do. I love exercising and used to do it everyday, and now I haven't had time to do any of that this past week because of school. I just hate this time in my life right now when everything is so jumbled up in my brain. I can't wait for the day when I have everything organized and I don't feel too constrained to one aspect of my life. I also hate this time because you don't really know anybody. True, I've met people and they are all really nice, but I haven't gotten to that stage when you can say anything to them and not look stupid. I am really glad that I did join the sorority just so I can meet people, but there are 60 people that I can meet and that's just too much for me to build strong friendships all at once. I do have some friends from back home, but I hardly have time to visit with them because I'm so consumed with everything else. I just need to sit down and relax. I did go home for Labor Day to visit my boyfriend, and that was exactly what I needed  just to hang out with someone who knows you so well. We did basically nothing and it was great not having to worry about anything. That weekend I think was somewhat a turning point in my attitude of college. It just made me realize that it is harder than I thought (adjusting wise) but everything turns out okay in the end. Plus I was happy to know that I do have somebody who loves me just as much as I love him; and that when I'm missing him, he's thinking about me too. I guess it just made me feel not so lost in college knowing that I have a great person back home supporting me every step of the way. Okay, twenty minutes are up. ",1
1960,"I am sitting here on the hardest chair known to man. Even with a seat cushion its still not comfortable. My roommate is talking to her boyfriend on the phone. They talk forever. They never discuss anything interesting either. Speaking of boyfriends, I miss my boyfriend. I am going to be really busy this week and I am worried that I won't be spending enough time with him. I have an application to fill out for a girls' group called the Texas Lonestars. It sounds fun but I am worried that maybe its not quite me. ""  The girls are really obsessed with each other and I never get along that well with girls. Girls usually hate me. I think because they're jealous and also because I am pretty intimidating. Meagan White probably hates me the most. I wish she would get over herself. God she is a bitch. It makes me insecure when Matt's ex-girlfriends are always still calling him, IMing him, and text messaging him. I trust him but its hard not to be bothered by it. I hope we stay together for a long time. I love him a lot. Geez its freezing cold in here. I think I get abnormally cold. I can't handle temperatures that are less than 73 degrees. Kelly and Chance are talking about getting married. but not to each other. I wonder if they will marry each other? I bet they will. what a boring couple they are. I think I'm too harsh on Kelly. I always judge her but then again she judges other people all the time. She is very racist. She hates our asian suitemate because she smells. But it is true. she always stinks up the bathroom. This is the easiest assignment I have ever done but it does kinda suck because its time consuming. I am tired and tired of school. I wonder if I should stay in business. I don't think its totally ""me. ""  But then again I don't even know what is ""me. ""  I only know what I'm good at. I don't really know what I even like. I think I think too much about the future. I always over-analyze things too. I can't help it. I'm a perfectionist. at least I want to be perfect. It seems the harder I try the less perfect I become. Does that even make sense? My back hurts. I'm trying to sit up straight so I have good posture and so I don't have to feel my fat rolls on my stomach touching. I wish I was skinnier. but I can't say I'm totally unhappy with my size. I wish my hips weren't as wide and my tummy was a little flatter. Yeah. dropping 5 pounds would be really nice. My face is starting to break out again. If there's anything that has been a huge pain in my life its my skin. It affects so much of my life and attitude. I thought the birth control was helping. maybe its just stress. Yes, I am very stressed. I have not had time to breathe since school started. And I know its only going to get busier. Sometimes I wish I could just escape. freeze time and come back without it costing me anything. My fingers hurt. And I'm still cold. I'm slumped over now, I give up on the posture and fat rolls. I feel guilty that my family misses me so much and I don't miss them. I really don't. Not even my sister Emily. which is a surprise. I thought I would at least miss her. but I don't. I should call them tomorrow. Maybe my mom could help me with my lonestars application. I have so much stuff to do. I'm scared. Why am I so touchy feely emotional lately? I used to never think of myself as emotional, but I think ever since I started dating matt I have become much more emotion oriented. I think I have become more insecure too. That does not really make sense though. But its like now I have to please him too. One more person to impress. before it was just myself and kinda my parents. but mostly my competition. I'm very competitive. I think of everyone as my competition. I bet that is unhealthy. but then again. what is healthy? I can't think of a single person I know that is ""healthy"" or has ""healthy relationships. "" I am almost done now. I'm just waiting for the clock to wind down so I cna start on yet another homework assignment. oh joy! I wonder why matt has not called me back. I need him to lift my spirits and to talk to. He is really wonderful. is that normal that I'm so obsessed with him? ",1
246,"Well, here it goes. I don't know exactly what to write about because my mind  is sort of blank to real thoughts as I've been studying all day. But I'll start with what is the most important thing to me right now--loneliness. What better thing to write about when you're listening to Bruce Springsteen. Anyway, it's not the clinical loneliness from which I suffer. It's more of a deprivation I guess. It's a deprivation of emotional intimacy. You see, I have quite a few male friends  which is great because male bonding is always a must. But I'm the type of guy  who always needs a deep relationship with a girl. It gives me a sort of basis in my life. Everything falls into place. I do better academically if I'm in love with a girl and I  am more confident about everything I do. I am so much happier when I'm in love. Basically, when comes down to it, I love being in love. How do I know?  Well, I've been there before. I fell deeply in love with a girl in my junior year of high school. Yeah, yeah, I know ""you were too young to know what love was. ""  I really wasn't. There's a Van Halen song which says           ""How do I know when it's love?          I can't tell ya' but it lasts forever.        How does it feel when it's love?          It's just something you feel together. '  Well, I completely relate to the togetherness part and lately I've come to realize  that I can also relate to the foreverness part, too. There will always be a place in my heart for Shannon. But she isn't the point. She is what was. And life isn't what was, it's what's going to be. All I'm saying is that I know what love is and how to love. I want it back . But it's so hard up here at UT to find it, or so it seems. I should be able to find it because I'm pretty good-looking and I've really turned into a nice person. But every girl that catches my seems so unapproachable. But, there's another factor in this whole game. I'm already in love. I'm in love with someone who  lives back in The Woodlands. I had a crush on this girl since my sophomore year and somehow we developed a friendship where both of us went through some peculiar twists. You see, we know we both liked each other and we both wanted to do something about it but we didn't. I didn't because I felt that if I told how I really felt, she  wouldn't understand and run away from me(metaphorically). She didn't do it because  I don't think she knew what she was feeling. She's never been there before so she's not familiar with the symptoms. It took me a while to figure mine out with Shannon, but when it happened, I knew the second it hit me. I think it's hit her but  she doesn't know what to do. Well, my twenty minutes is up so I'm gonna' cruise. But I might actually get on here on  do this out of pure enjoyment. You see, I always do this. I always sit down and throw up all this junk onto paper and then sift through the vomit afterwards. It helps when you're stressed. Anyway, thanks for listening, and if no one ever reads this  I DO THINK BERT FROM SESAME STREET IS EVIL. IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE, GET ON THE NET AND FIND THE BERT IS EVIL WEBSITE AND SEE FOR YOURSELF!!!!!!!!!        ",1
2450,"     I am excited about being a columnist, not because I like the daily texan particularly, although I do, it's more about the opportunity it offers since I can go on to write for the DMN or the statesman once I am out of college and I can get internships at newspapers during the summer so It will be more than just bagging groceries or lifeguarding, I'll be able to get better at writing, get some more exposure by writing for them, and get another newspaper on my resume and be able to spend more time in a newsroom, I don't know if I can write columns for a living, it could be a lot of moving, its not a very stable job, I don't want my family to have to move around the country with me but I obviously can't leave them behind and I think I want to have kids at this point, that doesn't mean I actually will when a time comes that having kids would be appropriate but I still can't ignore that possibility because putting my work before my family is no way run a household, but I can't worry about that stuff right now, right now all I can do is leave my options open so I can make good decisions later, so basically all I can do is write as well as I can and make good grades, I don't know exactly how to do either but I do know that both require a lot of work and being willing to accept and actively seeking help from others, that means I need to go to the UTLC finally and see what they can offer me and also try to make friends with other people on the newspaper staff and ask my friends and family to help as well with ideas and editing because no matter how well I can do on my own, I'm sure help from others can only cause improvement, I'm excited about the football games this weekend, as much as I love going to UT home games, an away game means that I can eat while I'm watching the game, it doesn't take as much planning, I can watch it with whoever I want and I don't have to worry about painting myself, the fact that some of the guys who want to do it, sit in the upper deck and we are in the lower deck could make things difficult, I would feel like an idiot if we could only spell tex fig, also, I don't know how well the other fans will respond to our painting, its kind of a hellraiser tradition so I don't want to step on any toes by doing the same thing and sitting almost directly behind them, however, this is longhorn football and there's nothing wrong with getting excited and getting other people excited, I'm a little worried about what I look like without a shirt and there's not a whole lot I can do about that before the next game but I'll do what I can, I'm bored with classes already, I havent really had enough free time to get bored with the social scene since I am spending a lot of my time trying to get the appartment set up so I can actually live in it, its not much use to me otherwise, but it seems like the more I do, the more crap keeps going wrong which makes me feel a little helpless, I've never lived by myself before and I havent lived away from home for that long, I've always been very dependent on others, especially my family but now my sister lives in lubbock and my parents live in dallas and none of my friends live in the same building as me since I don't live in a dorm anymore, I miss that aspect of living in public housing, the extra space and privacy is nice and is helpful sometimes but a lot of times, having other people around is helpful and that has become more difficult and also when people come over, they don't want to study, they usually want to play halo or do something so seeing my friends has become time consuming so I guess the solution to that is to get things done while I'm with them like by going to the grocery store or target, I need to get some groceries, I don't think I know how to shop yet, I still havent made a grocery list longer than 12 items and that's not enough when I go to the store once a week at most, I'm sure things will get easier once I get used to living by myself and living in this appartment but I'm anxious to get to the point where I am secure with my living situation, my friends, my schedule, and better at time management ",0
96,"Yuck, what a cruddy day. I had to go to 4 hours of classes and then I had to wait 30 minutes for the freaking bus to pick us up. Then I had to stand up for most of the ride home. And it was really hot on the bus. Luckily today wasn't too hot outside though. I saw on the news that we are expecting some rain and cooler weather. That's good. I guess. I don't know about the rain part though. I hope I can find my umbrella. I hope I didn't lose it when I moved up here. I live in a really neat apartment now. I like it a lot. And my roommate is really nice too. I was kind of worried about that. I transferred here from A&M this semester. I like it here. But it's not really any different than in College Station. Just bigger. My classes aren't any harder so far. I hate calculus. I'm usually pretty good at math. I think it's also because my TA that teaches our discussion is horrible. He hardly speaks English and doesn't know what he's doing at all. Of course I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t' really know what I'm doing at all either but. Wow 20 minutes is a long time. Lots of random stuff kind of floats through your head. Like the fact that I can see that I have email and I really want to check it. I just checked it before I started writing, I guess somebody wrote back. I wonder who. Probably Amy. Amy was supposed to transfer this year too and be my roommate but she forgot to send in her transcript. She's kind of spacey about stuff like that. But she's like the sweetest person I know. Actually I don't really know a lot of people here. That's kind of sad considering I knew practically everyone at my high school and I had a lot of friends at A&M. My roommate at A&M just rushed a sorority this year. Neither one of us rushed last year. I'm happy for her. I wonder if I shouldÃ¯Â¿Â½ve rushed this year. Then IÃ¯Â¿Â½d know more people. But my boyfriend goes to school here. But he doesnÃ¯Â¿Â½t know that many people here either. The year just started so I guess I'll meet more people as it goes by. I need to go workout tonight. I haven't worked out really well in a few days. I feel much better and more relaxed after I work out. I'm still feeling kind of stressed after my gross day. I have a lot of homework to do and a lot of other things on my list. I always make lists. I wonder what that says about a persons personality. I'm really organized and like to plan things. Maybe that's part of it. Strange. I wanted to plan a trip to go tubing in San Marcos before school started but we never got around to it. I hate how my boyfriend makes fun of me and says that I never plan anything. I know he's just kidding, but it gets on my nerves. He just doesn't understand I guess. Wow I just got a weird flashback of high school. I was a cheerleader and I just thought of some performance we did. I wonder where that came from. My typing has gotten really good over the past year. I used to not be that great. I think all the emailing made me better. I wonder who that email is from?  I haven't seen a lot of the people that I know here. I guess I should call them and get together. I feel like I don't have time though. I have to do homework, and work out and I need time to myself just to vege. Speaking of vegetables, I need to go to the grocery store too. I need vegetables, noodles, rice, chicken, cookies, hmm what else?  Milk. I like milk, especially with my cereal. I need more cereal too. I always want to get pancake mix. yummy. only a few minutes left. That's good because my back-neck-shoulder is starting to hurt from sitting at this computer. I need to get a cable so I can hook up my printer. Not that I need it yet but I should get that taken care of. My mom said she is sending me a package with cookies and candy and my last paycheck from work (lifeguard)and other stuff. that is something to look forward to. I haven't gotten any mail lately. I paid my rent today. through January. I need to call my bank and have them transfer some money form my savings into my checking. or else we could have some problems. but my grandfather is the president of the bank and my aunt is the CEO so I don't think that they'd let me bounce a check. That's going to be a shock when I have to go out and get  a real job and find a real bank. Time's up. Yea!   ",1
1360,"Hi, I will start off by introducing myself. My name is Eric Michael Beeson, and I am 19 years old and a second year student at the University of Texas at Austin. I chose this time to talk because I have something very important on my mind. I met this girl about 3 months ago exactly, to this day at summer school (ACC), and we've been going out for about 1 month and 1/2 now. Within the last 2 weeks, I've been becoming very sad, and I think it may be due to our relationship. She does something that i've never had an exgirlfriend do before, and that is. she likes to ""hangout"" with her exboyfriend. It didn't bother me at first, I guess probably because we were just dating and not serious, but within the last month we became very serious and fell in love with each other. This is the first time i've ever been in love, by the way. I have become very jealous of this guy and sometimes even suspicious. I don't think I have suspicions of my girlfriend cheating on me, but that her exboyfriend will put a move on her, and she will realize she misses him and go back to him. I really don't know what to do. She promises me that they are just friends (you can tell we've talked about this a lot), and she does spend more time with me. Maybe i'm just insecure. I've never had a girlfriend stay loyal to me, and that's probably why I fear the same thing happening again. While i'm writing this paper she is with this guy. Let me tell you a story about what happened 2 days ago. It was a Saturday night, and I just got back to my dorm room from work around 9:00pm. At 9:10 pm, my girlfriend calls, and I ask her ""What's up?"" I was expecting her to have some plans for us, but instead she calls to tell me she's ""checking on me"" and that she's going to her exboyfriend's house to watch Saturday Night Live with him because it's a tradition they have had for awhile. I became upset, as you could imagine, and she could tell on the phone. I told her that my roommate and I were going out, and that I would talk to her some other time then. So, my roommate and I prep to go out. I should probably mention that I have had a habit of doing dip, snuff, tobacco, or whatever the proper term is for it, and i've been attempting to break the habit for my girlfriend since she hates it. Well, I grab the last dip can I had in my room (it was in the trash can half empty), and I put the biggest dip all along my lower lip. I was so pissed off! My roommate and I then start walking out the doors to our cars, and as I walk out the sliding door, there she is! First thing she says to me is. ""You have dip in. "" We were a couple of very angry people that night. She had canceled plans with her exbf to come see me. I was then obligated to cancel with my roommate. We walked into my dorm room, and had a long talk that night. She was very upset at me for dipping, but she is also trying to reassure me that she and her exboyfriend are just friends and nothing more. It's very hard for me to cope with. I don't want to break up with her because I like her so much, and I feel we are very compatible aside from this one issue that I don't see eyetoeye with her on. I'm going to try to go along with this and maybe get to know her exboyfriend a little bit better. Maybe that will help me. Only time will tell. Well, it's been fun, but my time is up now. Thanks. ",1
196,"IÃ¯Â¿Â½m in my apartment with my new desk, everything is finally getting organized. I feel like this year will be a good one, I am not the same person that I used to be. I feel so much more secure. sure there were times when I would see people gathered in a huge group and think to myself that I wanted to join and be a part of it but when it comes right down to it, I am the kind of person who likes to have a couple of really close friends and then a lot of friends who I can say hi to and visit with on occasion. I really believe that that is okay. my boyfriend and I are great, I think it has a lot to do with the fact that I don't need to be with him all the time so we enjoy each other's company a lot when we are together because it is not so often. he sees me in a totally different light this year and I feel the same way about him. I wonder if Naomi is having a good time tonight with Ira. I think that she is trying to convince herself that she doesn't want any relationships with guys. I wonder if it bothers her that David is here. I hope not but I am not going to ban my boyfriend from coming to the apartment just because she doesn't have someone to come see her. I hope that isn't horrible. Hillel is going really well. it's going to be a really busy year I can already tell but I think that I can definitely handle it this year, I have the right mind set. the meeting last night was way to long though. who wants to sit in a chair for three hours discussing what seems like today as absolutely nothing!!! it was crazy. so many times I wanted to jump out of my chair and leave the room but I sat there and listened to all of the nonsense. this sorority thing is driving me crazy. on the one hand, it has the potential to be a lot of fun, on the other hand it is a huge time commitment and I am not sure if I want to put myself into something that leaves little time for anything else, on the other hand the old Kim wouldn't get involved at all because she would be too nervous. I don't want to be that Kim anymore. I never realized how hard it would be to write for twenty minutes. I feel like I have said a lot and it has only been ten minutes maybe. my boyfriend is in the other room studying, ha he has to go next. my classes are good this semester. history is going to be boring not because I hate the subject but because I am more interested in a discussion class and 1492 to the Civil War is so long ago and I feel like I studied it to satisfaction in high school. last year at UT I remember thinking it would be fun to study history again and I was irritated that as a freshman I couldn't take the class, look how times change. I think I am more organized this year than ever before in my life. my walls need paintings though or at least posters, I wonder where I can get cheap ones. I want to buy those glow in the dark stars and planets for my walls too. I think those are great. I wonder what my brother is doing right now. I hope he does better at school this year than he did last year. I am sure he will. he seems to have more control over himself this year. I can't believe he is taking drivers ed. how weird. I am so tired right now. I have so much reading to do. I am not going to sleep until it is all done, I must be prepared this year. I can stop thinking about some song where it says that the hardest to learn is the least complicated. it's hard to learn to study but once you do your life is so easy. I am going to learn that this year. that was an indigo girls song. what a fun concert. I wish they would come back to town. how great it was seeing Lauren Gasbar and Jamie. I can't believe I didn't see Rysse there. I missed her this summer. she and David will work well together I am sure. I am glad he is working at Hillel it will be nice spending time with him in that setting. ",0
1068,"Well today I feel really stressed since there are so many things to be done for my classes. Like today I had to do this writing assignment to get it out of the way and do my math homework. By the way, I have no idea how to do my math homework which adds on more stress to my life. Anyways this weekend was pretty fun since I went to a retreat for freshman and transfer students. I am a transfer student and I really miss Austin Community College (the college I went to last year). At ACC you get more individual attention and school work is a lot easier than here at the University of Texas. Today I have a class that is three hours long, and since this is the first Monday out of the semester it will be first time going to this class since it only meets on Mondays. Next week will be my first week to start work so I am really looking forward to it but also worried about how much rest I am going to get with school and work. It is my first job so I don't know how I am going to deal with it. Well this psychology class seems kind of scary because half of the time I don't know what the professor means by what he says and personally I am not a real psychology fan. I mean it isn't my favorite subject in the world and it is my first time taking a course dealing with how the mind works and why things are the way they are. I believe that God does everything for a reason so why question what God has done he knows everything. Don't get me wrong it is good to question things, but one is not going to understand everything in this world anyways. For example, if someone is brought up raising chickens in a farm and then goes to a city, that person is going to feel uncomfortable or out of place since he or she has been brought up in a farm. Well they are going to look at everything in a different point of view as if someone who has been living in a city all of their life. Also, people who lived in different countries with different customs and traditions, everyone is different in their own way so what good will it do to question everything since there are different answers for all of us. Another example is that I still don't know what correlation is we talked about it in the Discussion session and think it is some kind of relationship between two things and that is all I know. There are other terms that I am not to familiar with also and I hope I understand them better soon before the test. I really want to get good grades this semester so I don't have to be catching up in future semesters at the University Of Texas. I really don't know that many people here, but I have met a lot of new friends at my church and that has helped me to get used to University life and the moral aspect of what not to do and what is good for me. Well I think that is about all I have to say today, hopefully I will understand the psychology class better as the semester progresses. ",1
1644,"     Right now I am sitting in my room. my TV ison and I'm actually feeling a bit nervous about this incoming school year. I have never been away from home and i have never been on a university campus that had as many people as UT does. Right now I'm here in my dorm room, it kind of smells like B. O. , but I think that's because we prolly haven't cleaned up the mess that my room-mate and I have made. The TV is on right now and it's kind of distracting but I'm not going to say anythign because I would consider that rude. Is it bad that I put other peoples concerns and feelings ahead of mine. Dosen't that make me a less ambitious person?to tell yout he truth I really don't care what others think about me. All i care about is what I think of myself, and whether I'm happy with myself or not. At this point I'm happy that i actually got out of my home town. I miss it though. I really don't think that I was ready to go, maybe in another year or so. Is it bad that I don't like school?I know that it's only going to   benefit my future   and get em a six figure income with a house, three kids, two cars, a cat and be able to spend money and not worry about it. it sounds pretty sweet doesn't it. People don't really consider all the work that has to go into it but that's only to be expected. It does not cost anything to dream. I'm sure that it's all worth it though. having completed something that has put you farther ahea in life then the next guy. I'm sure that there will be plenty of oppotunities to make really good money with a degree, or two for that matter. I think that i'm really just nervous about living up to my own expectations. I set really high standards for myself and if they are not met then I have a total break down. I feel as though I am a failure and I probably will not amount to anything. If you can't tell i don't have that great of a self-esteem. I'm sure that by now you can tell that. I'm very intimidated by stadium classrooms. I'm very much more comfortable with a 35:1 ratio classes. I'm only hoping to pass all my classes with the very least a   B   I would say   A   but that goes back to my really high standards. Instead of being dissappointed I would rather achieve something that I know that I can probably complete. I think that this kind of puts me in a comfort zone because then i will never find out what my full potential might be. I will always wonder if I was ever able to fufill that   A   that i wasnt but never really went for. Does this make me a bad person? I think not. I'm really considering going to a university back home. I'm here in the college of Fine Arts in the Dance department. What can you really do with a BFA in Dance? I'm sorry but you can only dance for so long, and what happens if you have an injury? There goes your career and you have nothing to fall back on. I think that it's rediculous that you can't minor in dance. I'm very dissappointed in the dance department here. i actually thought that it would be better than it came out to be. I understand that UT isn't a specialized conservatory in the Arts, but if you are going to offer a major in Dance, at least offer an emphasis or a concentration. I am really considering majoring in Psychology with a minor in Dance. The university back home, University of the Incarnet Word, offers a minor in dance and a major in Psychology which sounds like the perfect program. I was also thinking about Mass Media. I was thinking about being a talent agent. I need to do something that i can see myself doing for the rest of my life. I'm not sure what that is right now. ",0
1398,"Isn't it amazing how lifting weights can make you so aware of your muscles? Every last inch of me is sore. I am such a weenie. Exercising is fun though. It helps me relieve stress. I'm already starting to feel a little stressed here. I wonder if I am an abnormally stressed person. What is a normal stress level? I'm having a hard time deciding which organizations to be in. I want to be in communication organizations to help me be prepared for my career but I also want to be involved in a Christian organization. Sigma Phi Lambda sounds neat but it takes up a lot of time. I wish I were better at knowing what God wants me to do. I want to follow Him and to be patient but I also don't want to not be assertive and let opportunities slid past me. I feel like much of my life I have been too laid back, letting things come to me. I'm tired of being out to lunch. I want to prove to my dad and my brother that I can be responsible and detail minded. I want so badly to get a 4. 0 this semester. I feel so torn. Part of me says drive hard! Study hard! Don't let organizations take time away from academics! Prove you are worthy! But I know that I need to follow God and the He is what gives me value. I am probably making too big of a deal out of all of this. I think I'm just frustrated with mistakes I've made in the past. I need to let those go and not worry about what my dad and brother think. I know my dad has faith in me deep down. I just feel sad and I don't really know why. I just wish I had more direction but even as I type that I know I just need to listen to God. I guess that's the problem  I'm mad that I don't get a clear answer from God. It's so hard. I've never been totally sure of what God wanted for me. Well maybe that's not true, but I never hear his voice telling me what to do. I wasn't even sure if coming to UT was what He wanted. I saw lots of doors open up for UT and when I was expecting to see bad things about UT I found that it really wasn't that bad and the students were really friendly. Now I'm trying to figure out what decision to make about organizations and I'm secondguessing every phone call from members in the organizations and the gut feelings I have when I go to the meetings. I don't feel any strong direction and I'm mad, frustrated. There must be something I'm doing wrong. I want to be closer to God but every time I try I end up getting so confused and frustrated with Him and myself. Why does being on the verge of tears for a long time make you have a headache? Man I hate how my desk is set up. Gosh, I'm being so negative. I really hope my paper is the one out of 540 that y'all decide to read. This really isn't representative of what I am like. Tonight is just a bad night. God has given me so much yet I worry about so much. Like my business and professional speaking class. I don't like the idea of being graded on my performance. I know I won't make eye contact and make all sorts of other mistakes and get a bad grade. Wow! Listen to me. I'm going to be one of the people they call to do a study of depressed people with low selfesteem. I put on that questionnaire that I am generally happy and have a high selfesteem but that was last week. Tonight for the first time since moving down here I feel sad. I was so proud of myself for not freaking out and adjusting well. Maybe God is trying to show me that I really can't do this on my own. ",0

I must go Junda Hu's office hours  today and hand in me homework, lest I be penalized. Where is RLM?  Where will I  go after that. Will I take a shower. Yes. Will I wear my pledge pin or on the  same plane, will I wear a collard shirt around campus this afternoon. I've had  a pleasant and not so well deserved morning lounging around the room while my  good buddy went off to an 8oclock class this morning. Too bad for him, although  I probably should have ittited off to Junda Hu's. We go over stuff that I know  too well already, but the homework definately should have been put up then. After Pledge Line I probably will not make class in the morning Friday, but I  know that I really should go. That would be a very terrible habit to fall into  although I know many upperclassmen that not only do not go to class on a whim,  but sell back half their newly bought books Like Brent right at the beginning of  the semester just for full retail reimbursement and on hopes to just wing it all  from the course packets and what not.

1452,"Right now I am a little worried that I am not doing this right because I don't really know what I am suppose to be writing about. Well, I am excited because my best friend, Courtney, is going to be in Austin in about two hours. She started school in Waxahachie about two weeks ago and I haven't seen her since then. We are going to the lake tomorrow and Labor Day and I can't wait. I love going to the lake with Courtney because her grandma has two jet skis and she lets us use them as much as we want. I am excited about school starting. I have always planned on coming to UT, but I never thought the day would ever actually come. All my classes seem okay and all my teachers seem very nice and helpful. I think that I will do pretty well in all my classes this semester, but next semester I am going to have to take a nursing 310 class and the main part of the grade will be based on a major speech that I have to give. I hate giving speeches. I always think that I'll do okay, but when get up to give the speech I start to shake and sweat. I am getting better at it though. I believe that the more you do something like that the better you get at it. My freshman year in high school I was terrified of getting up in front of the class. I would be shaking so bad they could hardly understand what I was saying. It was also hard to play my flute solos in front of my band class. During my junior year I was getting better and had more confidence in myself and during my senior I played at region band and almost made district. I also performed skits and memorized a Shakespeare sonnet and recited it in front of the class. I am glad that it has gotten easier for me, but it is still difficult for me to stand up and give speeches in front of people that I don't know very well. It's not as hard for me if it is in front of people that I know well or my family and friends. I just feel like people that I don't know are staring at me and judging me or something. Now I just try to forget about that and try to focus on what I have to say. As a nurse I will have to deal with people a lot. I enjoy talking to people one on one, but I will probably eventually have to teach others or give speeches so I will have to overcome my fears and realize that it is really not that big of a deal. I hope that by the time I graduate college I will have no problem speaking in front of people and that I might even enjoy it. ",0
544,"Everyone likes to party, but at parties, the girls are very stingy and very hard to approach. Even though I am polite and nice. I consider myself and average looking guy, not ugly. So I don't see what the problem is. So far, the first 2 1/2 weeks of school, I have not yet to meet a nice girl. I don't know what's wrong. It is sort of making me depressed. During orientation it wasn't that hard for me to meet girls. So far, I still hang around my friends that I had during high school. I want to meet new people as well as keep my old friends. I hope the meetings at FSA and VSA will aide me in meeting new people. The parties here are pretty cool though. I just wish they played different music. My neighbors seem pretty nice but they're total dorks. The girls on my floor are also hard to approach. I don't know if it's me. Maybe I'm thinking too much. The time I spend here seems to go by so fast. I get homesick quite often. I want to go back to Houston. Maybe the homesickness will go away as time pasts by. I haven't been spending quite as much money as I planned to spend. so far I have spent probably around 30 bucks a week. which is average I guess. My classes so far has been good. I just hate oversleeping. Right now all of my thoughts seem to be about college. College is sort of a different experience for me, but its gradually absorbing into me. ",1
1258,"Just sitting here and I decided that this would be a good time to write my stream of consciousness. I'm usually tired and don't feel like doing anything, but tonight I have this extra kick of energy (maybe it's the Lone Star). I've got MTV in the background. I swear all I've been hearing about is the Video Music Awards. Well. they'll finally be coming to TV tomorrow night. We had a hall meeting tonight to talk about the Fire Sprinkler Installation, but we didn't go. We decided to go to the one Thursday night, because my roommate was talking to her boyfriend. I always just sit there and listen to her talk. I wish I could talk to my boyfriend! I haven't talked to him for so long. let's see. since Friday night! I swear our relationship is so strange. We hardly ever get the chance to talk or see each other. I get mad at him during this time because I feel like he's not trying to put anything into the relationship, but the minute I start talking to him I forget about all those feelings. I'm just so happy to hear his voice that I don't care about anything else. He's supposed to be coming to Austin this weekend. I bought him a ticket to the 101 XFest. I haven't even bee able to tell him that he has one because he's never home so that I can call him. Oh well! I'm so excited that I get to see him soon. All of a sudden my thinking process stopped. I don't know what to write. This is how I usually feel when I get a writing assignment. My brain just freezes up. I put it off until l the very last minute. I absolutely dread having to take English next semester. I wish that I had tried a little harder on the AP English exam I took my junior year. I scored a 2 the minimum score you can get is a three to test out of it. I remember sitting in the biology lab room, it stunk like formaldehyde frogs. I have no idea why that's where we took our test. It took so long! On the last essay I wrote one sentence and then gave up. I wasn't thinking that scoring a good grade on this test would save from having to take English in college. Blah! Blah! Blah! I can't stop yawning. My eyes are starting to hurt from this bright computer screen. Ok it's 9:12. I can stop now. ",1
1805,"     I'M REALLY FULL RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I ATE A LOT OF FOOD TONIGHT. I AS GOING TO GO OUT TO DINNER WITH OTHER FRIENDS, BUT JUST DECIDED NOT TO GO. TE REASON IS THAT IDID'T WANT TO BOTHER THEM. They are all guys, and I didn't want to be the only girl. Anyway, I found out later that there were some other girls coming, but I just eating at that time already. A guy I like went there, too. I was going to go there because of him, but just didn't want to make it obvious taht I wanted to be with him. I am worried that he may not like me, but I'm pretty positive that he at least is interested in me. I was very worried in the biginning, though, because I wanted everything to happen so fast. All my friends advised me not to be that way since the most stable relationship is usually formed after a long time of being together. I guess I'm too impatient and too negative. I envy a lot of people who are positiv and self-confident. They are very proud of who they atr and not afraid of doing anything they want to do. I want to be that way. Sometimes I'm just too scary to start doing anything. However, what is really strange is that I am self-confident. I am usually a leader among my classmates and always think I will do good at most of things. I think I'm not confident of love. Especially, whenever I have somebody I like, I never consider myself worthy for him. Usually, I will think he won't think I'm pretty and so on. All these negative images are pictured in my brain. I do that because I don't want to be so positive, What if I think of all these good things, and they never happen? What if something bad happens? What if he says he doesn't like me? It's much better to think of worse and let good things happen. However, sad thoughts make me really depressed often. I become so biased that I won't see what really is going on. I'd like to be so wise. I don't want to be biased or anything. I guess in order to be wise, I need to read as many books as I can. Also, I think I need more experience. Experience makes one mature and smart. When I was young, I didn't understand why people call the old the wise. However, as I grow, I realized so many things that I now started to understand. The longer I live, the more I see, hear, and think. I am so grateful that I'm still alive and anxious to learn more about the world. There are so many things I don't know, and that fact just makes me go on. I love learning, and sometimes, I get frustrated becuase I feel like there's not enough time for me to know all these things. It's just wonderful to see the world and all there different things within. Different cultures, people, languages,and all these other things are very fascinating. I wonder how and when I will be able to experience everything! It is my dream to travel aroungd the world. I would love to travel and learn many things. I wonder I will be able to get a job and still traveil while working. I hope that can happen. Maybe, I can travel during vacations, but that sounds not enought for me. I will like to travel several times a year. I really think ther's not enough time to see and learn. This is why I try to do more things everyday, but now I'm getting too lazy. College life is exciting, but also make ",1

1623,"     I'm sitting in the library not much is going on in the building or in my head. I was hoping to have more to type, to be more prepared, but this is the best I can do with how ready I am now. It's very quiet, just the hum of my computer and that of one other guy's, people coughing, talking below a whisper, throwing things noisily into trash cans . . . or perhaps it's only apparently noisily, as this is a library, I've been here a while and thus am habituated to the relative soundlessness. Habituation is interesting, it's as though any noise could be going on for a day or so and after the first couple hours you'd hardly pay attention anymore. You'd only recognize it again once someone pointed it out, then it'd fade. So much is like that, for instance, it is only through feeling sad that we can fully appreciate our times of happiness. Only through experience of evil that we can differentiate good from it. That which makes things most apparent is contrast. I could draw you a picture of a polar bear in a blizzard or a black dog in the middle of a dark forest and you'd probably see a white sheet of paper or a black sheet of paper, respectively, but if I drew you a picture of a grizzly bear in a rainstorm or a green dog in broad daylight then I'd have to actually have some artistic talent, which I don't, but once again, it's only through viewing my doodling and bad sketches that you can recognize the masterpieces of van gogh, rembrandt, escher. Escher's an interesting one, his pictures representing in 2 dimensions that which is impossible in three, or simply tesselating objects that wouldn't normally be juxtaposed . . . it's like listening to bach, the crab cannon, sorry to use the stuff straight from GEB, EGB, but it's a great book and the several recognitions today of godel's theorem in action around me have brought it to mind. Even if you're prepared for everything, even if nothing can catch you off guard, something will. With any logical system that is sufficiently complex, all theorems within that system are not derivable using the logic of that system. The anomalous terms, numbers, theorems, whateveryoulike, are put into a new group, and labeled, still underivable, but at least named. But what is to name something?  Very far from actually understanding it. So we separate those out, create a class for them, etc, and say we've rendered godel's proof useless, but he answers, pulling yet more whateveryoulikes out of your system, causing it to constantly divide, in infinite schisms rendering scientific method, mathematics, logic, thought, computers, money, the world senseless, but hell sartre, camus, kafka all did that in their own ways. Murphy and Godel, two sides of the same coin, one the observationalist who saw that the other's mathematical explanation of Murphy's law was true. I hope that makes sense to someone besides me. How can anyone ever trust words?  They give us so little to go on. Try describing an experience you had to someone else. They'll hear your words, take them to mean something, then perhaps if your experience was interesting they'll attempt to pass it on to someone else, but all they have to go on is your original words, remembered imperfectly, thus if they're asked to elaborate they cannot. Divorced from your own head, your own experiences this same thing could happen to you as an individual as opposed to spanning people. The impossible to deny separation of the observer and the observed defies the unity each of us feels exists in the world. I am the universe and I act in the universe. I can view only so much of it and wow this has gone to quite an odd part of my head. Let's try some meditation. You hide, they seek. Sound should precede action, light should precede all, but that is not always the case. Instantaneous data transfer thru entanglement disrupts causality. This is as true now as it will be now. Hahaha. oops. I don't know what it means. My ass hurts. I should shift or something. That's better. I think I forgot what I was supposed to be thinking about. Don't take points off, please, haha. I still don't know what it means. Any of it. I've done this type of thing before but the time I remember best the words that came out were absolute nonsense. The goal was to choose your next word based on how it sounded being connected to the previous words. Phrases like 'other ear' came up, each word having a similar 'er' sound in it, and other odd things like that, and that one I was handwriting and somehow, I still can't explain it, I just got stuck repeatedly, perhaps recursively, writing the letter ddddddd ",1
1491,"The light above my computer is shining so brightly onto the screen. The bright light, almost blinding as I try not to look straight into it. My mind works rapidly as I am trying to focus on my thoughts. Whenever I actually try to think of something my head seems to go blank and I can think of nothing. I guess I don't really think of nothing because the brain is working all the time. There is always some sort of idea or made up story in my head. When I am alone, such as when I walk to class I always daydream about fictional stories or ideal occurrences that I would want to happen in my life. Then I worry that since I thought of it, it would never actually happen like that. I do not believe we can predict the future. Unless dreams are a prediction. Usually my dreams predict nothing and just are a picture in my head of the things I have been thinking about most often. Sometimes they are ridiculous and make absolutely no sense but that could be our imaginations working. I don't seem to get very much sleep. I wonder if that is bad because I am not resting enough and do not have as many chances to dream. I think dreaming is healthy and so much fun when you have a good, inspirational one. Our minds our so interesting. Why do they work the way they do? Will this question ever be answered? Why are people the way they are? It is so interesting to analyze people and their actions but many times I cannot comprehend why they think and act the way they do. Such as when they focus on all the unimportant aspects of life that really have no meaning. It is so special when I can actually find a person that I have a good conversation with. I left all my friends like that and am searching for those people here in Austin. They have to be somewhere, considering there are thousands of people here. Those conversations that leave you feeling in the best mood with a huge smile on your face are the best ones. When you've realized you've shared something amazing with that person or when you were just able to really understand what each other were thinking. Those are the people that leave an impact in my life. Those are the people that moved far away from me and are only reachable by a long distance phone call. These amazing friends are irreplaceable and I am only hoping to find people that come close the type of people I have known. This was something I was kind of worried about when I came here. Would I be drawn into the bubble of people's lives that move in a cycle with no positive direction at all as to who they are going be? Will I be strong enough to keep my attitude, hopes, and feelings about the person I am or want to be? I have found direction, the getting there is the problem. I am actually listening to the song Patience right now and I think it has a good message. This song makes me sad every time I listen to it. It is tied to such strong memories and now especially because I have left many of the people I love. It is hard when I think about this person. I miss them so and my body aches when I think about not seeing them for such a long time. This is maybe one of the hardest parts about college: the fact of moving on and leading a new life with out the people you have loved for so many years. Maybe, but my time is up now, and the rest of my thoughts will only exist in my mind. ",1
1539,"The timer is already on 15 seconds and I was thinking what to write. I am waiting for my boyfriend Nathan to call me because we just talked and he beeped over and said he'd call back.

I guess I am nervous about writing this because my foot will not stop tapping. I am so tired. I do not want to go to my Nutrition class today. It's the same thing every day and it lasts for an hour and a half. I have so much homework to do also. I just found out that my e-mail in the UT Directory is wrong and I have no idea who to contact to change that either. My eyes are drooping so bad. I have so much to do today and just not enough time.

I'm looking at the timer now and it is only on 3 minutes and 47 seconds. It feels like I've been writing for a lot longer already. I guess I should be lucky to even be on the Internet. My dorm, (Dobie), has had a lot of problems with Ethernet, and this morning (for the second time) when I awoke, my Internet would not work. It really sucked. My room is so dirty and I need to clean it. I hate making my bed and waking up to start another long day. My stomach hurts because I ate too much at lunch. The food wasn't really that great today either. I shouldn't have eaten any ice cream. I need to start eating a lot healthier than I have been. I feel bad that I have been cheating on my diet. It was a protein/no carbs diet and at first I did well, but lately I've been cheating. I need to go to Wal-Mart today to buy a friend of mine a wedding present. I can't beleive she's getting married. I'll probably be the last of my friends to get married. Three of the 5 of us are already married. My eyes are soooo tired. I just want to crawl back in bed. I really really wish today were Friday. I can't even imagine what next week will be like. after all, the past two weeks have been short weeks. Next week is our first full week. I am so ready for this weekend. I am going home and sleeping in my own bed finally. The phone is ringing. It is my boyfriend, Nathan. I'm explaining to him that I have to get off the phone because I am doing this assignment. Okay he is gone now. I told him to call me back in ten minutes and he said he'd call me back in a little while. that means by the time he calls I'll probably be in my 3:30 class. Sometimes he gets on my nerves so bad, but I love him so much. I just feel like he doesn't hardly ever have time for me. It's even harder now that I'm in school. We hardly have time to talk because he's at work from six a. m. to 5 p. m. and I don't get out of class m-f until 5 p. m. By that time both of us have to eat dinner, and I have homework or he has errands to run. sometimes he comes and sees me or I go see him. Seguin isn't really that far. But it is an annoying drive. This summer we're supposed to move in together. I almost wonder if we'll still be together then. It makes me sad to even think about us breaking up. He's the best thing that has ever happened to me and I've never been happier. I've also never been sadder sometimes. I guess that's just part of being in an adult relationship. If we live together this summer, we're going to live in San Marcos. I wish we could live in Austin, but he would have to drive to San Antonio every day. Oh well. I still have six minutes left to type. I need to call my mom today and see how my family is doing. They came up to see me on Sunday, but didn't get to stay long. It really is amazing how our relationship has changed. They finally respect me and give me my own space. Before, me and my parents argued ALL the time. Now we actually have phone conversations without even saying one cross word. it's pretty nice. I know it's just because they miss me though. The lights in my room are so annoying. the ones that came affixed to the walls are bright harsh florescent lights. the other ones we bought are sooo bright they hurt my eyes. I guess I'm not going to get to work out today. It's already 12:45 and I still have a lot to do before my three thirty class. I wonder what you guys are going to learn from all this babbling of mine?  To me, I wouldn't see anything interesting about a bunch of kids rambling on about their thoughts. Damn my typing needs work. I used to be a great typist, now I have to backspace a million times to get it right. It's terribly annoying. I think after I'm done with this I might sign up for my experiments for this class. I did the pretest the other day. it took way longer than I expected. My arms and hands are getting tired of typing. I can't wait until this is over. only 48 more seconds. that fan is still making that stupid noise, and my suitemate just got home. She always slams the door. I really need to clean my room and I guess I will in about 5 seconds. Okay well bye for now. I'm not going to finish my writing now that my 20 min. are up. I've got lots of other things to do today. bye ",1
1508,"I am thinking about an email I just read. It's from a friend from a      kickboxing class. He was giving me a hard time, Which is fine because I make fun of him too. He's a pretty funny guy but I am really trying to come up with a good joke to really bust his chops. I am also thinking about  how depressed everyone is today, being September 11th and all. I wonder how Sept. 11th will be in like 50 years. I also wonder how long it will take for it to get into student's text books. I hope they don't do the same thing that they did for Pearl Harbor and Titanic, and make a love story out of it. That's rediculous, there is more to it than some guy going off to work while his wife is at home and his lover is at his secret apartment. I bet a lot of people will be angry if someone manages to come up with one. I would hate to be President Bush now. He has some tough decisions to make. Half of the country says: Kill 'em all! While the others are screaming:   PEACE.   No matter what, someone will not get what they want. Even in the West Mall today, there are tons of people speaking their opinion, showing signs and passing out ribbons. But it's not totally black and white. I think there is a grey area. Some people say war and some say peace, but I think we can find some in-between. Killing innocent children isn't a good idea but we have to stand up for ourselves if we want this to stop. I don't know. . I don't like talking about politics or religion. Too much controversy. Everyone is too stubborn to see the sides of others. I am also thinking about when I was here in the computer lab yesterday. Some girl started crying really loud in the hallway. It was just like out of the movies. None of us knew what was going on. Some people got up and went to see, which (although curious myself) I thought was rude. I went to my kickboxing class last night. It really makes me feel self-confident. Learning those moves last night was a lot of fun. Why isn't the time and minutes thing doing anything? I am afraid that I will have to do this all over again. I am looking around the room and noticing that just about everyone here is checking their email. I guess no one does work on computers!!!  I like coming in here to check my email but I always feel like someone is reading what I am typing behind me. If they want to know so bad, they should just ask. I am very tired. I went to bed late, and slept through my alarm. But somehow I still made it to my 9:00 class. Barely! That class is fun. Learning sign language is very important I think. Just as important as learning Spanish or French or something. Going to the social events will be sort of weird though. Since I am not very good at signing, I will pretty much be a wall flower.    ",1
1423,"Well, I suppose since this is a stream of consciousness exercise I will just say whatever is on my mind, which at the moment happens to be how incredibly horrible this past weekend was. But, let's back up and get the basics down. For graduation, my grandparents promised to buy me a new computer. New, being the operative word. So they told me to go find one that I liked and tell them where it was. My mother and I went out and looked at computers and found a nice setup that included a printer for about $1500. We thought that sounded reasonable, so we informed my grandparents of the computer's location and they said it sounded good. HOWEVER, they went to see my Uncle's family in Dallas for my cousin's birthday and decided to go a cheaper route and not buy a namebrand computer. So I ended up with this piece of crap that keeps shutting down on me. My Dad has been freaking out for the past two weeks how he knew all along we should have gotten a different computer in the first place and how my grandparents always go the cheaper route even when it means less quality and now my entire college career is jeopardized because I cannot get online. So I spent Saturday messing with my computer, trying to reinstall stuff to see if it was a software problem. It wasn't. My Uncle drove in from Dallas on Sunday and took Windows off, reinstalled it, deleted my C drive (which is a big deal), then created a new one and repartitioned it, Everything SEEMED to work for a brief period of time before my computer decided to do one more mad little dance of irony and shut itself down. Now I am stuck with a computer that doesn't even partially compute and my Dad has to come pick it up to take it to some store called ""Computer Doctor"" and meanwhile he's still ranting about how he was right all along and my Mother should talk my grandparents into getting me a new computer, and if they don't how my parents should because if they don't I'm going to flunk because after all everything is online nowadays, etc. So I wasted my weekend sitting up in my room with my family when I could have been in the music room practicing. And I'm a music major, not computer science, so the music building is where I should be. But my mother wouldn't let me go to the music building because she wanted me to be around while they were messing with my computer. So I didn't practice AT ALL this weekend when my professor says I should practice 4 hours a day at least, and I just got a bunch of new music and now I'm totally screwed for my lesson on Friday. I also am having trouble in my music theory class because my teacher never bothered to tell me what an augmented interval or a diminished interval is, and they expect us to learn this stuff in one night, and since we have the class everyday, it's not like we can procrastinate at all. It's very frustrating. or maybe it's just me. I don't know. All I know is that I haven't even typed for ten minutes yet and I'm still complaining. It's not like I usually procrastinate about anything anyway. I mean, I was valedictorian of my high school, I think I know something about time management. Although, being valedictorian of my school was no terrible feat. I went to all the parties and pulled all the typical high school stunts, and had the highest number of ""unexcused absences"" you could have without being held back. And I wrote my speech at three in the morning the day of graduation. So I guess I know a little about procrastination anyway. But I had a reason for waiting that long really! When it was certain that I was going to be valedictorian, everybody started giving me tips, like they knew what they were talking about. ""Don't make it too long, I'll pay you five dollars to say my name, don't make it too boring. I don't want to sit through some damn boring speech. "" Even friends' parents were giving me tips. Everybody wanted to know what I was going to say, so I just didn't even try to come up with anything until the last minute, so I wouldn't have anything to tell them. Most people like me speech I guess. I worked in a favorite quote of mine by Theodore Roosevelt about how the real cowards are the ones who never try. It's a really encouraging quote, and I always used to repeat it to myself when I went to violin auditions because I am an extremely nervous performer. I also used to repeat that thing from Dune by Frank Herbert that the main character Paul used to say ""I will not fear. Fear is the mind killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. "" etc, etc. It always sort of helped me get a grip on myself I guess which I need because I'm a very insecure person. And I'm sure that my typing is annoying my roommate right now because I have to use her computer and she's trying to sleep and her computer is right by where her head is on her bed. It's only 12:34 though, and she always goes to sleep around midnight which I think is weird. But then I'm an insomniac and I can never sleep anyway, so I'm usually up until about three. I also am a coffee addict. have been since the age of seven. I think it usually surprises people that I've been drinking coffee so long, but my Dad used to drink at least a pot a day, to that was a drink that was always available. You'd think it would have stunted my growth, but I'm 5'7"". Then again, my brother is only 15 and he's 5'9"", so maybe I would have been taller. Maybe not. I sort of like my height. Hmm, I've got two minutes to go, and I lost my train of thought, so I guess I'll just keep typing until something comes to me. Oh, I'm listening to the soundtrack from ""Schindler's List"" right now. I totally love that movie and the music makes me cry. Music always makes me emotional, but this cd is played by Itzhak Perlman whom I personally feel is the greatest violinist in the world, although Joshua Bell, who did the soundtrack for the ""Red Violin"" is also really good, but younger so he doesn't have as much experience. I'm sure he will be so much better when he's older though. Well, it's been twenty minutes. It was interesting. a little personal odyssey of the mind there. Bye! ",1
821,"I'm kind of frustrated right now with Callie. She just left to go to meeting and she just bothers me. It's like she's annoyed with me but she won't say anything. I hate it when people do that-it's like just tell me what's going on, don't just act nonchalant about it. It pisses me off. It's like she just kind of ignores me all the time. I thought it would be better when she came back this weekend, since we spent time apart, but it's not. Gosh I sound like I'm talking about my boyfriend or something. But nope, it's my roommate. I'm feeling kind of pissed off about a lot of things actually. I ate way too much yesterday which sucked. And I was doing really well about working out here, and now all of a sudden I'm getting lazy. I don't get it at all. I talked to Price last night which made me feel happy and sad at the same time. It usually does when I'm here at school. He always makes me homesick. It just sucks because I was home the entire summer and he just didn't take advantage of it. I tried, I really did, but he didn't really make the effort until like the day before I left. Figures. It's so hard because we both like each other, but there's nothing we can do about it. It is so stupid that we are not in the same grade. I just keep thinking that God does everything for a reason, and that I should just feel lucky He found a way to bring us together in the first place. I went to church for the second time since being at UT. It felt good, but sad too. Kind of like talking to Price. I don't know-I know everyone says over and over again that it's hard to find a church in college and that you just have to keep an open mind, etc, etc. But it's true and I keep comparing everything to MDUMC. I miss it so much, especially Steve and Kristi. I miss everyone there. I wonder what it would be like to go home again next summer and do staff. I would probably be really bored, but I guess God will lead me where I'm meant to be. I just don't want to spend all summer in Austin drinking my life away. I mean, don't get me wrong, I like drinking, but I just don't enjoy doing it all the time. I just really need to get involved with some Christian organizations here. I also need to find a bible study that I enjoy. I feel so lost if I don't have fellowship to keep me on track in my faith walk. I hate being so close to God in the summer and then straying so during the school year. That's just not how it should be. I have got to work on it. I especially need to do my part here, like praying and quiet times. It's like working out-no never mind, that's an awful comparison that I really don't want to make. I wonder and daydream way too much. I wonder about stupid girly stuff sometimes like who I'm going to marry and when. I wonder if I'm going to get a job. I wonder about why I'm such a moody person. Sometimes I feel really different from everyone else around me. Sometimes I wonder what I would be like if I went to A&M. Would Cal and I still be inseperable? Would RT and I be good friends? I don't know, it's just weird. I wonder how it's going to be with Price when he goes to college. I wonder if he'll meet some girl and totally forget about me. I'd probably be so jealous if he ever found someone that he was closer to than me. But I shouldn't if he does-I should simply be incredibly happy for him. We just have a weird relationship. I wonder how Mike's doing really. I mean, I know he acts the same, but he has to be going through a lot. I can't even imagine. Sometimes I want to ask him about it, but I don't know how to put it or what to say. I mean, I can't just randomly bring it up. I wish sometimes that we still talked like we did in high school. It was weird last night when Callie and Todd were talking about Travis on the phone. I haven't thought about that boy in a long, long time. He still makes me mad. what a stupid thing he did. I still can't believe he threw away our friendship. we really clicked. we could talk about anything, and that just doesn't happen very often with two people. I mean, I obviously got over him romantically, but we could have been lifelong friends. Too bad for him I guess. I still wish sometime down the road that he would apologize, but I think a lot of people in life wait for apologies that they will never receive, or for people to come back into their lives that never will. It's foolish I know. I love my parents so much. I wish that I could treat them the way I want to deep inside. The way I know I will wish I did all of my life when they are gone. It's just ridiculous how much they do for me. ",0
1628,"     well i guess the first thing or the thing that i am sort of forcing myself to now think about is what i was thinking about before. and that would be how much i miss my best friend. i was eating at Wendy's and i was really hungry because i hadnt eaten anything all day and it was already 5 by then. so i ate a jr. cheese burger, medium fries, and some orange juice. then i went bak and got a salad, frosty, and some water. but i dint really know anyone there because the two friends i came with went to a HOSA meeting so i was by myself for a while so i started thinking. and my thoughts were many but they sort of led back to my best friend Rakhi at Texas A&M. i don't really know exactly what i was thinking or what i am thinking but i know it was something along the lines of i just really wish i could spend some time with her. i guess i'll get bak to her later when i think of more. my cell phone just rang so i guess that interrupted my train of thought. and iM guessing its most probably Amit because it said   unknown   for the caller ID which most prob. means that its him because his phone is the only one that does that. Also i am really use to pushing   Ctrl S   and i can't really do that here because i am not  writing a word document - i am glad i have developed this habit because it ensures that 90% of the work i have done is saved every few minutes because i really hate having to redo work. now i guess i was just thinking of the clock. i was sort of seeing how fast it would go - like i am sort of surprised that it is already 7 minutes. i thought because of what Monique said that it would take quite a bit of time but time seems to be going by fast enough. my eyes are burning i think because of my contacts because i have gotten enough sleep since i sort of woke up at 2 o' clock today. Once again. i guess my mind - - she just called and it made me feel a lot better because i just told her that she was going to live a thousand years since i was thinking about her. and she was like   awwww I Love You   in the cutest little voice and hten i told her i had to finish this and i also have like no daytime minutes due to a family plan. and now the dorm phone rang and Arpan called. i guess we don't have too much peace and quiet in this dorm. lol. but ya it was really cool that she called. and she is stored on my cell phone as 'princess' so its really cool seeing that pop up on my phone!  Well besides i guess really wanting to see and hug her i don't know much else that i am thinking about currently. i guess maybe finding out how much a Greyhound ticket to A&M costs since i would love to go there. Well i guess i also need to figure out what i need to do for the remainder of the day such as finish my MIS homework, chek the emails from Dell, check out the Sprint family plans so i can see how to get more daytime minutes, read some Eco, go over Eco notes, read some Philosophy, and the Philosophy book, read the beginning of the Psychology book, and finish Chapter 1 of MIS, and finish reading Developing You Into Me of Ba101. wow i guess i have quite a bit of reading to catch up on. so maybe i should take care of that for the remainder of the day rather than wake up at 2 o' clock. i really need to wake up earlier and get my homework done. it would be really beneficial to me if i started doing that. Besides all that, Sid, my roommate, also suggested a movie at 9 playing for free at the Union so i may look into that. besides all of that i think i need to use the restroom after i am done with this and i don't really know why i just wrote that down besides the fact that it says write everything you are thinking about and so i was thinking about that so i thought id write it down - just like i was thinking about writing about thinking about going to the bathroom - so i did write it. now my mind is just free i guess. in regards to tom. which is Friday and now the phone just rang and now 20 minutes is over but i was just thinking in regards to tomorrow and the rest of the weekend what i am going to do - whether im going to go home or just stay here but i guess i'll think more about that later ",0
507,"john is talking a lot. I don't care if a lot is supposed to be 2 separate words. I like this song. wow It's already been 1 minute. I guess I just think slowly. hmmm, my mind just went blank. oh crap, I have 4 classes tomorrow. did I finish all my homework yet?  oh shit, I have a lot of calculus to catch up on. I've only done like 1 assignment out of 4!  John is talking to Alice and it's interrupting my stream of consciousness. hey. if you're unconscious, and you have a dream, is that stream of Unconsciousness??  hahaahahaha  that's a cool thought!!   ahhahahha!! oh cool, my friend is online!  she was at the party on Saturday that I dj'ed. I thought I dj'ed crappy but everyone says I DJ like a club DJ. I wish I could DJ Austin but Austin is owned by DJ boombai. I wonder if he's any good. he uses records instead of CD's. I hear he spins hip hop. I guess I have a chance since I mix club music and not hip hop. Sam is instant messaging me!  argh, I've written so much and it's only been 5 minutes. do I really have to do this for 20 minutes?  this is pretty brainless. I wish all writing assignments were like this. wow it's late already. I go to sleep too late everyday. I better go to sleep early. all we do is watch TV. marc mcgwire broke the homerun record today. that's pretty cool. I wonder how Sammy sosa feels. I bet he's happy for him but deep inside he was like ""damn, I almost had it!""  he still has a chance though. wow my bed is messy. the covers are like everywhere. I like my posters. chow yun-fat's gun is cool looking. Acura integra is such a cool car, especially the type R. I wish I had a type R. after college, I want to get a type R. I wonder if I'll be rich after college. I hope I'm rich. I wonder what my future will be like. I wonder if I'll be living in an apartment or a house. I wonder when I'll get married. I want to get married around 25 - 29. I wonder who I'll marry. I wonder if it'll be my girlfriend right now. I really like her a lot. I can't imagine being without her. she was at the party on Saturday too. I wonder if anyone else will get me to DJ their parties. I hope so - I want to make some extra money. what the hell kind of song is this?  mp3's are the coolest things!  I can download them for free and burn them onto a CD and make my own favorite CD's. I might go for a masters degree. I might get more money. I know!  when I get my bachelors, I'll look for a high paying job. then if I don't get a good job, I'll go back for the masters. I can imagine myself as a traveling type of businessman, getting up early in the morning, taking a shower, putting on my armani suit, kissing my wife goodbye, driving my Benz to work, coming back in rush hour traffic, and doing it all over again. ooh how long has it been?  it's been 15 minutes. cool!  I'm almost done with this one. I wonder how long the next assignment is. I still have to do that pretesting thing. Ben and Tony have been gone for a long time. I wonder when they'll be back. I wonder what they're doing. did they work out or hoop?  my girlfriend is a private investigator. hahhahhahaa  lethal weapon 4 was a cool movie. jet li is awesome. he kicks ass. I wonder if I'll have time to take martial arts next year. should I take capoeira or kung fu with my because?  I hate this song. john's taking a shower. something is beeping. my contacts are dry. I want to play starcraft. that's a fun game. I like to build up and overwhelm the opponent. oop, times up. ",0
1602,"Ok, well here's the first writing assnment. To begin with, i'm really, really hungry. As is the case, in many college student's lives, i only woke up about an hour ago, and so havent' eaten anything. I've already done laundry though, so I guess you could say i'm semi=productive. I've also talked to Road Runner because they came out the other day and installed the new cable modem in my apartment, but it didn't work. So i tried all the diagnostics that they told me to do, and it still didn't work so i called them this morning. As is always the case, it worked when they asked me to go to the internet, so I seemed like a fool. Well, as soon as we hung up the phone, i tried the internet again, and it didn't work. . I'm pissed. So now i have to use my roommate's computer and a regular internet connection, which is slower than anything else you can imagine.  But on to other things. I'm going to play football with my co-workers from the club on 6th street (the VIBE). It's amazing how you never know when or where a friend might come from. It has always been my belief that a boss will never be a friend, even though it may seem so at times. . . it's really just business. But these guys are different. Perhaps it's the type of business, or maybe they are the one-in-a-million type, or maybe even i'm mistaken, but either way, we're going out to play football as soon as i finish writing this journalistic internet assignment. My best friend had his truck towed yesterday, and the day before he had his wallet stolen, so of course he came to me wanting to know if i'd lend him some money and take him to get his truck back. So, being the good friend that i am, i went to the bank and withdrew 150 dollars and took him to the towyard to get his truck. However, since he didn't have a liscense, i had to sign for the truck, wich only means that i could get into a world of trouble if he ever wanted to screw with me. Apparently by me signing for the truck, my friend could come back the next day and ask for his truck, and since it wouldn't be there, it would be   stolen   which meant i would be held accountable for grand=theft=auto. But i assured my friend that even though he is bigger than i am, i have a lot more friends that are bigger than he is. . you never can tell with people. So back to being hungry again, now my stomach is growling, and i wish i would have eaten before doing this thing. Of course, i am only half way finished, and i grow hungrier as each minute passes. I really shouldn't be playing football today though, because i should be reading all the assignments for my various classes, but what good would that do me?. . . really, i would be a unsocial. . . and besides, i like football better than studying. I guess that's wjhy my grades are the way they are, but who cares, i was a grade worrier all through high school. . i never got a B in my entire li8fe and graduated top 2% (14th of 720). BIG DEAL. I've realized now after 2 years of college that grades really don't mean that much. I mean, yes, you have to graduate and all, but how hard is it to make a 2. 5?  I've failed a couple of classes now, and still have a 3. 2, so you obviously have to REALLY screw up in order to make below a 2 GPA. I guess i shouldn't talk that way, because school is hard for some people, but then again, htat's just an excuse, because i think that anyone can learn somehting, you just have to find the right way to get to them. It's like physics. I can teach anyone physics, it's just a matter of how you explain things. BAck in highschool, my physics teacher was horrible at explaining things, and everyone was alwyas confused, but i would re-explain using every-day examples, and then they would understand. I explained circuit-theory using the large highways in houston (where i lived) as the   circuits  . The cars were the   moving charges  , on-ramps were like batteries, and so forth. Using this method, all the people that i tutored on average scored at least a grade point higher. . give or take. ANyway, i just wish i had it in me to be a teacher because i know i'd be a good one. I just can't see myself teaching. I want to own businesses, and yezs, make a lot of money. I have a business eye. everywhere i go, i'm always seeking a new way to make money, or what business i could start that would flourish. Well, it's almost over, and i must say, i'm not as hungy \as i was at first. So thats it. There's my mind in a nutshell! ",1
178,"wow, I want to go talk to the socialist organization they have a booth out on the west mall, but I am scared. I called them a long time ago. do they remember? I was supposed to go to that march but I didn't I hope they don't remember me-as  not showing up-IÃ¯Â¿Â½ll go in a little while. I hope the toadies don't open up for rage on Saturday, the toadies don't deserve to open up for a band like rage-rage has energy and pizzazz. the toadies suck, they're okay. i dunno, that boy looks like Andy, I don't know what to write, I am trying to write whatever pops into my head first, I wonder what they're gonna do with this I thought he was sam, I  look around at people  a lot, I wonder what people think o f me when they see me,  I think I am pretty thin, but I have a poofy stomach. liposuction would be great, what am I gonna say when I go up to the socialists? hello?

I hope I have been writing long enough I think so  adios ",1
1080,"I am the egg man whoo I am the egg man whoo i am the walrus coo coo cachoopp? and that girl with the intriguing eyes looked through my spectacles and I could sense her ability to discern my anxiety. she knew she was pretty, and my sudden glance away from her, told her exactly what I was thinking. just from one moment, a bug's seconds glance, I was ashamed. as if I had stumbled upon a lady, naked or something horrible that would define my clumsiness of timing. but its all the same if you don't mind dear reader. I'm just a bit antsy, anxious, looking for colors undiscovered of nature yet. I am positive God has a predestined pastel palette that he has not yet utilized. I mean who knows? with all the toxins in the air, it makes one wonder who is the greater painter of a sky or landscape, man or God? so my friend and I are walking in a park and I said, ""wow what pink skies, I am so amazed at the beauty that surrounds me at this moment, I mean its all celestial, you know all of it """"hey, want me to burst your bubble,?"" she says. ""I know I'm going to regret this, but yeah tell me why!,"" I said. ""its because of pollution. the gases in the air. "" and then everything drowned in the void of her gibberish, hogwash, drivel, and my subconscious began to speak for her almost. I wanted to believe that it was something supernatural. something that was not polluted or tainted by the industry of man's ambition and stuff. ""no"" I said. ""that's not true,"" I rebutted. ""because if you look at the painters of 18th century romanticism, you notice the Delacroix pinks and blues of paint in the skies. or Turner's exaggerated oranges and stuff ""she didn't know what I meant, and I don't think I was talking much sense either. but those faded or bleached greens never leave do they? the trees, like that of an oil painting. its all too much it seems for some, I guess even me. they, those greens, speak of nature's affinity with the species it serves, and the congruence of it all. I think that if she, my friend, would have told Vincent van Gogh that same monstrous factoid she had told me, I could probably imagine him in a self portrait without any ears at all. coo coo cachoop? that damn Beatles tune.

1783,"     My roommate just asked me if I have any homework due tomorrow and I don't but yet I still feel as if I need to be reading or studying gor something. I'm afraid I'm doing what I sould be doing, what everybody else is doing, studying. I feel as if my classes aren't hard. I also feel as if everyone knows what they want to do in life and I have no clue. I feel so ashamed that I don't know. Before I came to college, I knew what I wanted to be and do so I was going to come here and work for that goal. I would rather do nothing else but be a teacher. I want to teach so much but there is absolutely no money in it. And thats terrible because teachers can be so influencial. I have had several teachers that have been awesome and make me want to teach even more. I want to help and to influence and to have that feeling that I was a part in that student's recieving and A on a test or a paper. I would want to teach either a math class or biology for highschool students. I was always tutoring and helping my friends or anyone that needed help and I enjoyed it so much. I graduated in a whole year early to get out of highschool. Don't get me wrong, I had a great time in highschool but it was time for me to leave. It was time to start my life. I am in a hurry to grow up, I'm tired of being young. I feel as if I've been the youngest in everything. I was the youngest one at all my family reunions, I was the youngest model. Yeah, I model. It goes on like that for a lot of things. And now I'm the youngest in college, its seems anyway. I graduated early for lots of reasons. Everyone asks me what made me decide to do it and I never really go in to it because I din't like to tell people my sob stories unless I trust them or they know my background. But since I have to write for 20 minutes, I'll tell you. It all got started when my parents got divorced when I was in 8th grade. I really feel as if I had the perfect life if thats even possible. Both my parents got remarried to other people within a year of their divorce. I went through a really hard time then, and I know its completely cliche but I would love it if they got back together. I think they're perfect together. The woman my dad married was a complete idiot. I mean, its sad being 10 times smarter than someone twice your age. But now they're divorced, my dad just wasn't happy with her. I'm happy she's out of the picture. The man my mom married is a big reason I graduated early. I loathe and despise him with a burning passion. I know its immature and selfish, but I will go out of my way to be a bitch to him. I think he's a horrible, miserable man and is completely wrong for my mom. A lot of people say, no youjust don't like him because he's not your dad, blah blah blah. But then they meet him and understand exactly what I mean. I think my mom was a little selfish when I she decided to bring this man into our lives knowing no one liked him. I have this wierd ability to pick out people I know are not good people. My parents had this friend who I hated since I was a little girl, the first day I met him. Later, when I grew up i find out he was a big cocain addict and was always calling my parents to pick him from jail or get him out of whatever mess he got himeself into. I never liked him. I get the same feeling with my step father. I don't even like calling him. I usually refer to him as my mom's husband. I feel so bad about leaving my little brother. He's 9 years old. I hate to leave him with at home with no one to defend him against my step dad. I always stood up for him shen Bert, thats my stepdad's name, would be rediculously rude for no reason. There's sometimes when my mom would step in and say something. My real dad is there, always around doing things with us, don't get me wrong. I have the greatest dad. I feel sorry because my dad is not onw for being alone and I think he's very lonely right now. Especially not that I'm gone, thats one less child for him to be with. I have an older brother too who goes to school at Vasser in New York. He's kind of lonely there right now and he's thinking about coming home and going to school in Texas. I love texas, I wouldn't want to live anywhere else.    ",1
1453,". I never thought it would be this hard to think about my stream of consciousness. Now that I am aware that I am actually thinking to myself, it makes it really difficult to think normally. I keep giving myself all these weird things to write about but really none of them are really representational of the real way I think. My thoughts are usually random and irrelevant to anything going on around me. You could say I daydream often. I really wish that I were doing this in a quiet room because the things going on around me are effecting what I want to type about. Julie, my roommate, is usually in the library so I guess I should have taken advantage of that earlier and done this assignment then. My attention span is short. I keep finding myself drawn into her conversation. It makes me think about talking to my friends on the phone, which eventually leads to me reminiscing about some past event involving my friends. The funny thing about my situation now, is that only actual people talking, interrupts my thought process. The television doesn't disturb me at all. I have gotten very good at tuning it out. Maybe its because I have made it a habit of doing just about everything with the television on, including sleeping. I am growing impatient with the time now. It seems like 20 minutes has gone by, but when I check my clock it always reads the same. Time always passes slowly when you grow anxious for a certain amount of it to pass. This assignment is difficult for me. I am really having trouble recording my natural thought process instead of just making these random thoughts up for the sake of using up my 20 minutes. I just keep looking around my room hoping that it will spark some thought and give me something more to write about instead of this meaningless rambling. I don't know, my mind is blank now; I am pretty much out of time, so I think I will end on this statement. ",0
318,The one thing that I miss here at school is my drums. I couldn't bring them with me to college because there is no where to put them. I used to play in a band and people used to tell me that I was really good but then I stopped playing and I got worse. When they were always there for me to play I never wanted to but now I wish I could play them more than anything. My best friend is a drummer but he always kept on practicing and he got really good. So good that now he is moving to Maryland to join a band. The band he is joining is pretty successful death metal band and they have two albums. I miss my friend and I hope that he is doing alright up there. He left all of his friends and family back in San Antonio and he doesn't know anyone in Maryland except for his band members and he really doesn't know them too well. I wish I could go up and see him and watch his band play since I am a big fan of death metal music. I listen to all types of music but death metal is definitely one of my favorites. I don't like it when people talk bad about death metal when they don't even know anything about it. I want death metal artists to be able to someday get rich off there music like all of the other pop artists. Because the talent that comes along with death metal music is remarkable.  ,0
906,"I hope no one heard me yelling and screaming for the Cowboys game. That was the most awesome season opener I have ever seen. I really haven't been keeping up with the Boys but I'm glad I got to watch them. I really have been missing football. I can't believe I haven't even been to the Longhorns games. I watched their games more when I wasn't even a student here. I guess I got so caught up in the Spurs mania happening in my city. That excitement will be hard to beat. I remember the night the Spurs won the championship I was downtown because my friend since first grade was having a graduation party at La Villita. I knew I had to go since I was so close to her family for so long. Her mom was my coach. I still call her Coach. Anyways, Analissa promised that there would be a tv there for me to watch the Spurs game because I am a die-hard Spurs fan. Several years ago when they would play really well during regular season but then lose in the playoffs, I would go in the guest room, put my head under the pillow and start to cry. I was embarassed that I was crying but my hopes had gotten so high and they had really let me down. So when they finally had an awesome chance at winning the NBA title, you better believe that I wanted to witness it. I was so disappointed when my friend didn't have a tv at her party. I seriously wanted to cry. I am not just one of those fans who likes their team only when they're winning. I had been waiting so many years for that night and then I didn't even get to really enjoy it. I wonder if anyone is writing to Professor Pennebaker about their sexual thoughts. I bet he is thinking, ""That's not what I had in mind when I told you to write anything you're thinking. "" Back to what I was saying, I was so desperate to see the game that I called my friend on my mom's cell phone and told her to call me and pretend to be my mom, telling me to come home because if the Spurs won it could get too rowdy downtown. So I left with my best friend, but I felt really bad that I lied to her family, because her mom was thanking everyone who showed up to the party despite the fact that the night would go down in Spurs history. She said that we were Anie's true friends. Ouch. So Rae Ann and I walked downtown to different smoky sports bars trying to find a decent place to watch the game, which was already three quarters over. Finally we just went to the Marriot hotel and found a tv. There were a bunch of drunk older men hitting on us, but at that point I could care less, because I was so into the game. I wonder if the professor is going to think what I'm writing is boring. My roomate just came in the door. She was out of town for the weekend. I hope she doesn't mind me using her computer, cause I still haven't gotten mine yet. Back to my story, I watched my game and we won of course and it was one of the happiest and adrenaline-running moments of my life. How pathetic right? Just kidding, but it was exciting just like the game today. I wonder if Eddie saw the end. I know he had been watching it. I hope he calls later because I miss J. c. I love their apartment. I definitely want to move there next year if I have enough money. Those were the best apartments. An artist must have designed them, because they looked so modern. I'm looking at my watch and there is a minute and three seconds left. This assignment is really neat but it is kind of hard to track my stream of consciousness when in my mind I know I am writing for an audience of at least one person. Oops, my watch is beeping- time's up. ",0
282,"I am sitting here writing this on a Sunday afternoon. Tomorrow is my birthday. I will be 20 years old. I think I am going out to eat with my parents tomorrow night. It is sunny outside right now. I do not feel like sitting inside and working. I think this is cool how we can turn this assignment in over the web. I wish more assignments could be like this. In almost 6 and a half hours I will be 20. That sounds so weird to me right now. Last night I went to the Rage Against the Machine concert. It was pretty fun. I went with a bunch of friends. Sort of like an early birthday present. I am running out of things to write. I have a Spanish project to do after this. I still have Rage songs in my head from last night. There were so many people there last night. I heard that over 10,000 tickets were sold. It seemed like that many people were there. I am still tired from the show last night. I was disappointed that one of the opening acts for the show didn't make it. I wonder what I will get for my birthday. I already got a GoodFellas poster from one of my friends. GoodFellas is my favorite movie. I have the movie and seen it at least 40 times. I want to take a nap, but I have to much work to do. Hmm, can't think of what to type. I hope I get some money for my birthday. I guess I'll just have to wait till tomorrow to find out. Later I am going to call a friend of mine who I haven't talked to in a while. Last night I slept with my contacts on. I better go take them off after this. I don't think that is good for my eyes. So far the school year is off to a good start. I am seeing friends I haven't seen in a while. ",0
1192,"I am extremely tired having recently returned from classes. The bus ride wasn't as cramped as usual but just as long because of the heat, and because I had nothing to look at or it'd seem very much like I was staring at someone. Not that it really matters though, but either way, I prefer looking at the 'view. ' Anyways, I'm not much in the writing mood right now. I'm so used to just rambling on like in my journal entries only I tend to forget almost that I'm turning this in. Well, actually, I haven't forgotten that because I am not getting personal with this. Which reminds me, I haven't written anything in a while. I mean, anything all together, not just journal entries and such. Did I ever tell you how I started writing in a journal? First, let me note that I call it a journal, not a diary because it sounds much too feminine and prissy. A silly thought, I know, but that just shows how immature I was when I first started. That also reflects another aspect of the way my family is, but I won't go there. It's too complicated and no one will ever be able to figure it out. Really, my family and I are all about each other. People who know any or all of us may find that odd especially if they aren't so content with their family or at least at the moment. But, like I said, completely different, controversial, complex topic. I'll just end up talking myself in circles again. But like I was saying, my first journal was from Mrs. Stevens, my seventh grade English teacher who I used to help sometimes in the mornings when we actually got to school early enough for me to have time to assist her. I was her teacher aide, which was something that junior honor society students got to do. It (the honor society and everything else involved with junior high) really is petty, among other generally negative things. Well, let me type faster so that I can finish this lame, boring story. Well, at the end of the year, as is customary, we exchanged presents once again. I of course was broke as usual so I think I ended up giving her some flowers that I got from my aunt's wedding the weekend before. Hey, I think I did that with my secret teacher too. Yup. Anyways, she (Mrs. Stevens) gave me a journal because of the one almost actual conversation that we had (I wasn't very good at being social then, if you can't tell). We had talked about writing and I mentioned how I thought that it would be awesome to actually write a book someday, something great that I can sit back and just stare at knowing that I put all those words together, I wrote all of that. I don't know, I like to see good effects of hard labor. You know, the finished product. I guess that's why I enjoy writing, drawing, coloring, making things, and putting things together. Oh, and reading too of course. Anyways, back to my story again. Well, I also mentioned how I thought it was neat how one of my friends, Vicky Walsh, who had just moved to this school from the northeast, had written a sort of book that told you how to draw horses. The plan was that she would write and draw the pictures and another girl whom she later became better friends with in high school, Lindsey Day, would type it and get paid for that. Well, Mrs. Stevens gave me the journal at our last morning together and told me that this could be my start. In fact, she wrote inside something cliche like, ""just think, one of these days when you write your book, I can say that you used to be my student. "" Except, it didn't sound so cliche as that when I read the inscription. She also said how she had always regretted not keeping a journal especially now. Then, I was just happy that I received a present, a pretty yellow one with stripes on it. Yes, I was a very selfish and greedy person. Needless to say, I did start writing in that journal. In fact, my journal collection has grown to about four or five maybe. I'm really not sure. I stopped writing for a long time then I started again. I've been too busy and lazy to write lately, which always makes me feel guilty for some reason. I guess I am really grateful to her for that first journal though. I wonder if either of us realizes what kind of a difference that has made for me, especially during the hard times I guess. Time is up now. I'll write more later. Bye bye. ",0
1429,"Sometimes I like Stream of Conscience writing because when I write fictional or nonfictional stories, that is usually the style of writing I use. I used to write a lot when I was younger and planned on becoming a writer. I stopped at about the 6th grade because that is when I began to focus more on school. I think that middle schools and especially high schools place too much emphasis on grades. Those institutions should be places for students to WANT to learn, but now it's all competition and people care less about what they actually learn and get out of the class and care way too much about whether they get an A in the class. Now that I'm in college, I'm trying to start fresh and actually become passionate about the classes I take, whether they are required or not. I still have no idea what I want to be when I ""grow up"" besides a movie star. I'm open for all sorts of things. When I applied to U. T. I wanted to be a big time advertising CEO, but then I decided that would be selling out too much. Within the last couple of months I thought about dental school and becoming a dentist, but I still don't know. I would really like to be a movie star and I plan to save up money and go to Los Angeles 2 summers from now and just live on my own for the summer and audition for jobs. I know so many people go there and do stuff like that and still don't become famous I haven't even taken a theater arts class since the 9th grade! I don't think taking theater classes do much though, unless one wants to be in theater, but I don't want to stage acting, I want to do films. I think in films to start out with all you need is a little talent (which I think I have) and a good looking face/body (which I am working on. haha) So that's my plan so far. I haven't told really anyone. My best friend thinks that I am going with her to backpack in Europe next summer, but I can't afford it at all. I plan on working at a pool hall next summer so I can make a lot of money and save up for my next years apt. and my famous L. A. trip. I would also like to take a bus to New York sometime and live independently. My brother Danny did that a few years ago and wrote in a journal the whole time. I would love to get that kind of experience and keep it in a journal. I should probably get a journal now so I can record my little experiences right now, but so far nothing spectacular has happened. I thought that since I'm a freshmen in college I'd be meeting TONS of new people and be going on a billion crazy adventures, but I haven't at all. Most of the people at U. T. are from my high school (I have at least one person from my high school in each class) so it's hard to branch out and meet new people. I've also been stressing over money lately because I have to pay for everything (books, tuition, housing) myself and I haven't had time to think about doing fun stuff. I just got a wristband for the Texas/OU game, I'm not that interested in football though. I like basketball a lot and can't wait until UT basketball season starts though. I would like to make the most of my time in Austin, since it's such a beautiful and fun city, but I don't know when to start. I'm going to Dallas this weekend, so maybe next weekend I'll hop on one of the buses and tour the city. Sometimes I like not knowing where I'm going. I just like to relax and look at all the things around me and see the sights of Austin away from the campus and the tourist parts. One day my sister and I took the wrong bus and it went throughout the more ghetto/barrio part of town. It was real interesting to see the different people get on the bus. We saw 3 cute little boys around the ages of 9,10, and 11 and I admired how independent they seemed for such a young age. They got on the bus not knowing where they wanted to go, but just decided to go anywhere and I overheard them say ""We've got 2 hours, where do y'all want to go?"" I think I'm mature compared to my peers at times because I had a dysfunctional family life growing up. Through high school though, we moved into an upper class neighborhood and I attended a very affluent high school which I sometimes felt like a liberal outcast amongst a bunch of conservatives. Some of the things people at my school would say about poor people really pissed me off. But it's been 20 minutes so I will finish up. This was very cathartic, I should really invest in a journal!

1984,"I don't know I fell kind of weird talking to a computer. Well today has been a really strange day. I didn't start school until 2pm so that was great. It lets me get lots of sleep. I think if I didn't get enough sleep I would be more stressed out then what I already am. Ok feeling weird again. I don't know what to type about. Ok, well yesterday I realized this guy that has three classes with me. So that is kind of cool. I went up to him and talked to him and told him that he was in my two classes. We later found out we had another class together, Philosophy. It is such a big class, I was not surprised I never notice this guy was in my class. After that I went to read by Psychology book because I'm kind of behind on my reading. Today I finally caught up. I feel better in that sense, but I'm still behind in my other courses. It's really stressful to have so many classes at the same time. But I see other people and they seem to be doing less work then I am. They are either smarter than me or they or procrastinating. If none applies then I kind of feel sorry for them. This weekend I finally get to go home. I'm kind of happy to go back because I miss my baby sister. She is like one year old, so I hate to miss her growing up. She is really funny and I love her a lot. When I'm at home she follows me everywhere. As for my parents I miss them too, buts its kind of relaxing to not live with them. More stress when you live at home because you have to live to impress. ""  I love my parents and all, but I like living on my one; well kind of, still have a roommate. When I go back home I get preferred treatment. This is because my parents miss me a lot. I'm actually not that home struck, I don't find it too difficult to live afar. I think this is partially because I know that if anything arises they are about a two or three hour drive away. I do feel sad that I'm not spending time with my family though. In this sense I feel inhumane, because I made the final choice of coming to Austin. Well it seems like half my time is over and I am starting to run out of mind speech. Ok, I'm just typing to type. Well, then that water bottle looks really good about now. I actually find college possible as long as I find time to study. That is the hard part because I spend most of my time walking from class to class, cleaning my room, doing laundry, taking a shower, eating, or just relaxing for a moment. There are so many little things that we have to do everyday that actually take a lot of our time. It's kind of aggravating but I guess that's just the way life is. I guess someday I'll get to rejoice in all that I have accomplished in the far future. I am scared of failure, but I deal with it. It's not the end of the world. I like this concepts but try not to remind myself of it or else I will use it as an excuse to not do something. I think Psychology is going to be my hardest exam because those old tests are really specific. I was like wow, I remember reading about that but don't exactly remember the detail to answer the question. That is another thing I am afraid of. Not being capable to learn all the stuff I need too. I know that if I gave myself enough time, like years I could definitely remember the details. But in the allotted time I have to learn all this information, along with other classes, just thinking about it makes my head hurt. I can't picture myself learning every single thing the book has. Especially when I have 5 books, and I have to learn almost all the information in all the books. Yeah, well I got my head hurting again. One good side is that this typing thing is almost over and I can continue studying. Although this might seem like a summarization of my daily life, this is what actually goes on in my head all the time. Especially the headache part. I think one of my major weaknesses is my English. Basically I learned English from tv because no one at my house spoke it. I guess my first language was Spanish, until I began watching tv and understood it. I hate having weak English skills though because I always below average. I guess its the one thing I'll never be good at. ",0
2241,"I am sitting here thinking about what I am going to eat . I am very hungry. for lunch i had a sala, some pasta and some soup, oh that guy was really hot . when I work out today those guys are going to be really hot too. oh god something stinks. i wonder what it is . I hope its not the person sitting next tome. what is that girl wearing she looks very tacky. when I go to my dorm later I am going to fall out. First I have to call my parents or they will get mad . this is a library why are people walking around and talking so much. I wonder why my roommate does the stuff she does, and why is this person talking so what is wrong with his hear okay it is really starting to stink. oh crap I'm supposed to meet my roommate for lunch but oh well it doesn't matter, this is much more important. Last night the MTV music wards were so crazy, there were a lot of crazy things happening everywhere, I thought I was going to flip. I absolutely loved what Beyonce and Alicia Keys were wearing. I wonder when will Destiny's child get back together hopefully soon. Man I hope I did good on my Spanish quiz it was fairly easy I think. What classes do I have tomorrow hopefully easy ones because I can't stand some of my classes. i wonder what my roommate is doing right now. I wonder if my exboyfriend has a girlfriend right now. man when will this be over 20 minutes is a long time to just write about anything. ooh another hot boy oh and there is his girlfriend. That's okay I look better than her anyways. I wonder what my friends are doing in El Paso maybe I'll give them  a call when I have time. I'm so excited the first football game is this week what am i going to wear who am I going to go with Hopefully we will beat north Texas. oh my god games mean after parties and after parties mean really hot football players too bad I'm only 17 I can probably still get into some clubs. the ones that allow babies. Man it seems like I have been on here for years when is this crap going to end. wow my stomach just growled really loud, hopefully no one heard me but if they did ohg well I know they are probably having the same problem. I wonder what my brother is doing I wonder if he quit the football team yet I told him he should just do track but he didn't believe me so that is his fault, but he'll learn they always do. I wonder did my mom send my money for my ATM because I know I could still use it Oh crap the time is almost up I thought my brain would explode ",1
233,"Well I am sitting here in my room and it's about 2:30 PM. My roommate  is on the phone so it's not very quiet in here right now. Last week my boyfriend hooked up the Ethernet on my computer. After trying to get it to work we finally got everything hooked up. It seemed to be working, well all of the programs  were working but when I went to shut the computer down it came to a blue screen and my computer was messed up. It said a bunch of stuff about pressing a key  to terminate a program that wasn't working, well I pressed a key and the screen was frozen. What's wrong!!!!  I restarted the computer and shut it down again and it still did the same thing. Today I turned the computer on and it did the  same thing. I called the computer center and after being on hold for an hour I finally go help, well I guess you can call it help. He couldn't help me but he set up an appointment for Friday with someone who will help me. Hopefully I can get this thing figured out. I just bought this computer a few months ago and  it was very expensive. Well enough about computers. I am a little tired. I had an 8 o'clock class, after the class though I came back to the room and took a  nap until 12:30. I think that made me even more tired. Well I need to start reading my English. I have a book I have to finish by Thursday. I am half-way through, but there's still 120 pages to go. I hate reading!  I read slow and it takes forever. That's not very good for an English major. I should enjoy to read, especially  because I will be doing a lot of it in the future. I am a sophomore student here but this is my first year here. This is a big change, I am very close to my  family and it was hard to leave them. I am 2 1/2 hours from home so it's not that far, but it's still a lot of driving for the weekend. I went home this weekend. I was glad to be home. I'm not sure if I like this place yet or not. I think it will take a little time. At least my roommate is sweet, we get along good. That's a positive thing. The bad thing is that last night we found roaches under the sink. Babies so they're everywhere under the sink. It is really gross. I never saw roaches before so I freaked out. The weird thing is that we don't  have any open food, I guess the roaches are looking for the water and it's also  dark under there. We put a request in to have someone come and spray. They  haven't yet. I hope they come soon!  Well my time is almost up. This was really  weird just writing off of the top of my head. Actually it's kind of peaceful because I enjoy typing. Well I have my psychology class next, at 3:30 PM. I need to get ready for class. I need to check if they got the books in yet. Last Friday they didn't have the book in. Well my time is up so I will submit now. Until the next assignment. see you later!!!!   ",1
613,"This is my first year at UT and I am not used to doing everything on my own. I am scared that I am not strong enough to make it. I am trying hardest though, I do not want to disappoint my parents. I feel like there is so much to get done and I will not to be able to finish everything on time. I am also worried because I do not understand a lot of what is being taught in my classes. This is extremely frustrating because I took these classes in high school and I did well in all of them. I am confident that I will be able to pull through all of this, and hopefully I will be a stronger person for it. I do like this new environment, however. Austin is a beautiful city. I love being here, and being on my own. I feel like I am discovering so much, and it is great!  I think I have all these different feelings because I am in a new place, with totally different surroundings, and most of all I am on my own. There is no one to depend on but myself. I already see how I am changing and growing. Even though everything seems so overwhelming, I love the experience!     ",1
2028,"I'm so tired right now. I wish I could just sleep in my bed at home right now. Man, my feet smells. I guess it's time to wash the slippers. Gosh, right now would be a good time to get a nice massage. My back is aching now. When will I get used to this new change? I don't know if I can make it. Well, I have to. I must. Everyone expects me to. Of course I expect myself to succeed as well but everything has just been so overwhelming. So much information is given in the class and I don't know what I should write down. Ok. I'm tired of listening to the same song. What are they talking about? It makes no sense to me. Alright. Piano music is the way to go. Yeah. This will relax me. I need to rest my eyes. Can I type with my eyes close? No, I'll probably start typing some wrong stuff and then it'll be a waste of time. Hm. I think I should put this printer box somewhere else. It's kind of annoying me in a way. But then again, I need to put my feet over it for support. Books, books, books. I'm tired of them already. I can't believe I was actually excited about learning all this new stuff. Now I'm dreading every minute of it. My forehead itches. I'm so bored. This is really crazy. My goodness, there's about twelve more minutes remaining. Ah! I think I'm about to fall asleep on this laptop. Hm, roommate's back now. I wonder if she ate dinner yet. She probably went to eat with her boyfriend or so. Hm, do I need anything else for my dorm? I think I should decorate it more. It still looks a little plain at the moment. I guess I should utilize some of my time for creative matters. Yeah. I should make more cranes and turtles to put around my area. Aww. The crane and turtle on my laptop looks so cute. Ouch. I bite my lip. Where did roommate go? She left again already? Maybe she is just now going out to eat since she came back with her backpack just now. I don't know. Geez. Now that guy finally decides to respond me. It's about time. I instant messaged him like a while back. hm. The Asian talent show was quite interesting. That one skit by VSA was pretty cool. Too bad the guy's voice was spoken by a girl. That made him seem pretty gay. Oh okay. So it was a girl's voice because it was suppose to be the voice of a young boy. I see now. Yay! I have four minutes remaining. So what am I thinking about now? Oh man, JAY is so fine looking. I need a bigger poster of him to put on the wall. Gosh I don't like this chair I'm sitting now. It's not very comfortable. I feel like rolling back and forth but there arent any wheels. This sucks! Hm. I should go work out tonight. I have not done that in about a week already. This is not good. I have to stay in shape. I don't want to gain the freshman fifteen like people say. Either way, I just want to be fit. I think I should head out there right now. ",1
2357,"  Okay I was asked to write about the way that I'm thinking this is an pretty easy assignment, but then comes what am I suppose to write about and is it really that easy to put thoughts to paper. I know one thing is I sure do really want to go back to houston where life was much easier and fun. Here people are to damn concieted and full of them selves, theis mainly means the females, maybe its cause I'm hispanic or something. Either way I never had diffulty meeting girls. Well its probably cause I miss my gurl my lil china back in h-town. Hmmmmmmmmmmm what else mann I'm bored and tired and I wonder why my led hurts. Its been doing that all week. I'm not as athletic as I use to be that makes me sound like an old person. But foreal though its so boring out here parties are bunk. Who the called me today have no idea who was that girl I wish I knew who she was thought she sounded reallly good though. Lets see what else is there to say I don't really feel like college has got hard yet but I feel it coming. I hope I'm ready when all the hard works hits me BAAaMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmm!!!!!!!!!!!!

1905,"I finally have the time to sit down here and work on this assignment. Today was my first day of work, and it went well. I met a lot of friendly people. I am trying to type while my roommate tries to distract me, punk. What am I going to have for breakfast tomorrow?  What am I going to wear tomorrow?  Is it going to rain tomorrow?  I really want to barbeque and have a cold one. The only class I have tomorrow is Integral Calculus, so that's cool. My arms are somewhat sore from working out right now, and my mind will not stop thinking about the steak that I want to cook. I have the A1 marinade ready to marinade my steak. The season all and lemon pepper. I'm hungry. What all am I going to have for supper?  I know that I will have the steak, but should I have a salad or pasta with it or both?  Often times I stop and think about how my mind wonders around from thought to thought. My friends tell me that I always just from one idea to another. My roommate is going to cook his supper. I don't think that that is some sort of 'disease' or illness, I believe it's just that my mind thinks a lot. Will I be rich and have the house that I have always wanted; Will I have the money to retire early in life and buy that house on the lake for my father. That is my goal in life. To retire early. I want to be retired at the age of about 35 so that I can repay my parents for everything that they have done for me. Man, this time thing is going soooooo slow. I'm on 6 min and 10 sec. I know after this assignment I plan to have dinner and do some dishes, but then what am I going to do?  I have the option of working on work or ironing, sleeping, calculus. so many options. what to choose. The weather is awesome right now. A nice cool breeze is blowing through with the rain. I wish I did not have to work on a damn apple computer at work. I am capable of functioning on the MacOS, but would much rather use a pc. 8 mind 15 sec. I wish I would have had time to have seen some of the documentaries on TV  today about sept. 11. O well, my parents are planning on visiting me this weekend. My mom wanted to see me and my aunt wants to come up to do some shopping. That means that I am going to have to wait until next weekend to go out to Lake Travis if I get the chance to. I know. I'll eat, shower, do my work, calculus, then sleep. When I wake up in the morning, I can do some reading for mythology and MIS 310 maybe. Na, I'll finish the cal since it will be do tomorrow night. I need to get that done, but I knew that I had this assignment to do first, so I decided to take care of this. Who decided to name a bottle Captain Morgan's Parrot Bay""?  I feel like watching The General's Daughter. Good movie. I wonder. hopefully a girl I met at orientation and I can get together sometime when we are away from school. We've been tied up with a lot lately. She is beautiful, nice, funny. and so on, but no relationships for me for a while. I feel that I need to enjoy myself right now. Now the time seems to be going faster. crazy 12 min. 50 sec. That food that my roommate is cooking has an awesome aroma, and that damn lightening. better not mess up my computer because that would piss me off. I don't know what I am going to do for spring break this year. I think I should go out and enjoy it and party again at South Padre Island. actually I would only like to go there if I can DJ there. My friend and I were super close to DJing during this past spring break, but I would rather go to Mexico or something. Crazy how so many college students travel countless hours to go to a beach during this time. I understand it's a lot of fun and all, but for me. I lived an hour away, so I took my computer and bumped some jamz while I was out at the beach. I remember being on the balcony, pretty smashed, and looking at the waves roll in. The hotels lining the shoreline and nothing but a beach view, it was great. Then at some place called Tequila Frogs, some crazy chick from New Jersey jumped into the hot tub fully clothed and took some off. Girls Gone Wild was going to be there. U know, I think it's stupid that the beaches are getting tougher on underage drinking during this time. I understand that they want for people to be sage, but if they don't take their economic situation into consideration. they are going to loose a lot of people. I was reading the paper one time and it reported that South Padre Island lost a great deal of spring breakers. I'm sure partly because of the tough laws. They could make so much more money if they created a SEMI safe environment. but let people have some fun. It's like 6th street. punks are extremely strict on underage drinking, but I know the law . whatever 19 minutes. almost out of time. sorry. My steak is waiting for me. and I am tired. Still trying to think of what to have for breakfast tomorrow. I'll think of something. well. think everything is planned out. Can't wait to party this weekend and all. it'll be cool. ",0
1818,"     I am wondering how I am going to type because I do not type very well. I also think that you are going to think that i am stupid for misspelling words and what not. i feel anxious. i do not know why. i feel stressed beyond belief. i want to got to sleep right now. i am wondering what i am going to type next. i try to write in journals but when i write about my feelings i go off on tangents, like writing my stream of concsiousness (however you spell it) i feel as though my mind goes a mile a minute and i want o verbalize, write/type, etc what i feel or think but i think that my body is too slow. like i start to studder, or i am not able to formulate my thoughts completely, i don't type fast to keep up with my thoughts. i have a fear about writing, i do not know why. some insecurity i must have developed and know it makes me really nervous to the point of where i begin to sweat and feel . i do not know?   today was the yr anniv of 9/11, i thought it weird that one of my prof kept referring sept. 11 as 9-1-1. i thought how strange is that, how strange that prof is in general. there is osmething about her that is really weird. i hate to be so judgemental, but there is somethiing weird there.    i had a wonderful conversation with my mother today it was great, i love her  we talked for about an hour. i talked about my fears and growth as a person. she seemed truely interested in me. i feel that people are not interested in me (except my bf, but he gets on my nerves)  like i talk to people and i want to get to know them, i ask questions, and people just love to talk about themselves, but as for me, i do to, but no one seems to care (except my annoying bf, he seems to want to know everything down to the second. this is him calling me right know on my mobile, how weird!!!!   i told you. he wants to talk to me every five seconds, he is like a girl or something, always wanting to know what the hell you are doing.  i hope this has spell check on it because i know i have probably mispelled a lot of words. don't you hate it when someone sends you an email or something and there is a mispelled word on it?  i feel really embarressed for that person, so i never want that to happen to me so I always spell check, but i guess i can't this time. i am not that stupid. or am i?   well i have about 2 min left, it wasn't that painful   i thought i was going to be staring at a blank screen wondering what the hell to write. the 20 mins went by really quickly 10, 9, 8,7,6, 5,4,3,2,1 yea!!!!!  its over!  not bad, eh?  enjoy   ",1

1612,"     I really don't know what I am thinking at this moment. I am in a state of emotional turmoil at the moment. I can't believe they cancelled Farscape. I see no logical reason why that was necessary. I mean, the show had decent ratings and Scifi had already agreed to pick it up for another season. It has to be something that doesn't concern the show. If I were paranoid I would say it was a big government conspiracy to see how people react to great emotional turmoil. I can't believe this is happening. There is no reason for it. It can't be financial difficulties. Farscape is the highest rated series on the Scifi Channel. This is completely unbelievable. This is a major flaw on  their part. They cannot possibly be sane or sober. Maybe all of the executives are are currrently in the process of overdosing on crack, coccaine, heroine, and ecstasy. They have to be mad. There is no other logical explanation for this. It is freaking stupid. Complete idiocy. This only further proves that the Scifi Channel and USA Networks is truly run by a bunch of apes who have no grasp on reality. This sucks. They might need to be tortured to see the error of their ways. all of them. I wonder if the police are goign to get a  hold of me for writting some of this. oh well, at thist point i really couldn't care. i really have  no idea why i decided tto write this now, i guess i j ust needed a distraction from my own thoughts on this tragedy, at least a tragedy in my mind. Damn, this is so fucking stupid that they are doing  this. This really sucks because i just realized that the time counter thing on this paage that keeps track of how long i have been writing is not working. So i have no idea how long i have been writing. I am quite aggitated now, i have to write for an even longer period of time  to make sure that i write at least the required 20 minutes. i hope a new network decides to pick up Farscape. I really hope so. It really sucks taht it is being canceled after its current season. This is totally screwed up. THERE  IS NO LOGICAL EXPLANATION. Every CEO and executive HAS to be high on something to come  to this decision.  I wonder how long i have been writing?  I guess i t started a t about 1:44. Taht is only a guess though, i reallly have no clue when I started this. I hate not having controll over a situation. I hate that there is not a whole  lot  i can do to reverse the fate of Farscape. I hate that i don't know how long i have been writing this thisn. My leg hurts. I hope all the letters i sent to all of  the higher brain function deficient Scifi and USA Network execs can see the error of their ways and NOT cancel a great show. I would like to boycott the channel but i also watch another series on it. DAMN ME FOR LIKING STARGATE: SG-1!!!  I wish i didn't like taht other sereies so  i could wholeheardedly boycott the sons of trelks.  My sister hates math, she jsut asked me a math question. I don't like teaching people things, i get easily frustrated when i know something and have explain to others.  If the Scifi Channel was STUPID enought to cancel thier highest rated show then  no  other program is safe, the will probably cancel Stargate nec (the assholes) and then i would REALLY have a reason  to boycott. i wonder how long i have been writing this?  Alll of the Scifi execs and USA Network boneheads should be tortured for thieir stupidity in this matter. I would like to be a major contributor in their pain at this moment. Those bastards. how can they do this to me?  how can they do this to my sister?  This blows goats. Damn them. I wonder what it  would be like for them to scream in uninhibited pain and angiush, does this make me a bad person?  I don't think so, not at the moment. They deserve whatever the get. My sister would tie them down for me so i could get to the torturing without fear of them escaping. I think  that time has run  out. I don't know   if it has. The damn counter is all screwed up. If i submit this and i don't get credit because i didn't write for a long enough period of time, i will be pissed. It's not my fault that this damn time thing isn't working. I wish they would reevaluate their decision to cancel. i hope this has beeen and adequate amoutn of time. Well Hell, I'm getting more angry writing about how wronged i have been, like everyone else that they are canceling what is possibly the greates show on the air. ",1

1085,"I have to my homework. I have to study for my chemistry and history. I have to go to Houston this Thursday, so I wont attend class. I have so much shit to do. my mind is going blank right now. oh yeah. I have to go home and clean the dishes, wash my clothes, wake up at 9:00am, get ready and because of my homework I will not be able to go to sleep until 12:00. Tomorrow first thing in the morning, I have to pay my tuition bill of 4 dollars, go to the bookstore and buy my precal book and psy. book. right after I type this I have to go to HEB and do some grocery shopping. since I have no food at home I will buy milk, cereal, junk food, chips, pizza, juice, Gatorade, water, bathroom, paper, tilex mildew stain remover. this is hurting my neck. it really hurts. I need to go home and go to sleep I will be so happy after I get this assignment done; I will be done with at least one of my homework for school. I feel so tired right now; I just want to go home and go to sleep. I cannot stand being here [library] any longer than I have to. ",1
1979,"I really like the song that was on MTV just now. Simple Plan is a cool band. I wonder what my friends are doing later for supper. I don't feel like going to class at 6. I just want to sleep. I wish my boyfriend and I would stop getting into arguments. It really sucks when we fight, I hate it!  I'm kind of hungry. Where is my roommate?  It seems like she is never here. Oh well, more private time for me. I miss my mom. I have so much to read for my classes. Chapters and chapters and chapters!  Looks like I have my work cut out for me for a long time. My Spanish class seems really easy, I hope it gets harder, so I feel more challenged. I wonder when I should go talk to an advisor about my major. Should I change it, not change it, minor, or double major. why is everything so difficult?  All questions and decisions in life should be yes/no or multiple choice!  That would be so wonderful. Celebrities are so gorgeous, they suck. Although, they are pretty cool people. I guess, I don't really know them. I have an itch on my leg. I hope I don't get sick, that would be horrible. I can't wait for the game on Saturday. It's going to be so much fun. Rap music gets on my nerves. I need to finish taking pictures on my camera so I can get them film developed. Why is so cold in here. I turn the air warmer, and it gets too hot, then I turn it cooler, and it gets too cold!  That sound is annoying, I wonder if the AC is supposed to make that noise. This room needs to be vacuumed. It's gross. My mom sent me a letter. Yay!  I'm excited, but I can't open it until I'm done writing this assignment!  I need to turn my closet light off. I'm thirsty. I feel like drinking a Dr. Pepper. That sounds so yummy!  I think I might eat a pickle when I'm done too. That sounds like a plan. I'm almost done with this thing. Mom uses ugly stamps. Oh well, I have cute ones. ",1
2037,"I just got back to my dorm from my friend's dorm. I'm so tired. My eyes feel blurry cause I need to take out my contacts and my head hurts. Oh man my head really hurts. At Johnny's dorm, he tried to tickle me by grabbing my neck which is where I'm most ticklish. Everyone knows that and yet he still grabbed my neck. SO I leaned back away from him in order to escape and I hit my head on the shelf thing by the bed. What a loud noise there was. It hurts so much. Anyways, I can hear the fridge making sounds right now and it smells like Korean food in my dorm. My roommate just had Korean food. I'm not really used to the smell and it kinda bothers me but there is nothing I can do about it. Speaking of which, that is why I'm never in my dorm and I'm always at my other friends' dorm. It's because of the Korean food smell. Plus, we don't have a tv in our room and it makes it kinda boring. I can now hear clicking noises from the mouse that my roommate is using and the typing on the keyboard. I like the clicking sounds. I don't know why but for some reason I think of horses walking everytime I hear the keyboard. I've always liked the sound. Man this room smells like Korean food and I don't like my jeans because they feel too short on me. I think they shrunk because yesterday I was an idiot and I washed them in HOT water. I don't know what I was thinking. I meant to put warm water but I accidentally pushed hot. I told my friend Danny about it and he was so nice. He came over to try to help me cancel the wash but he was not able to. My pants feel short now and they are exposing my ankles and I'm wearing low ankle socks and its annoying because my ankles feel cold. My hair is also in my face and the A/C is making it move in my face and its really annoying because its blowing in my face. My roommate just went to the restroom. I hate the sound of the door opening. The door makes this stupid and annoying creaking sound. I don't know of any door that does that. WHy does she have to slam the door? Why can't she close it quietly? How come when I leave I am nice enough to close the door. AHHH! the phone is ringing. Its a scary sound cause its so loud. But yea anyways, why can't she close the door quietly? Well, I don't like my laptop. I hate typing on this thing. I spent so much on it and I don't know but the keyboard seems to be malfunctioning. Everytime I type something it jumps back a few spaces and then I have to erase and retype. So I put in a new cordless keyboard and its much better. I really ought to get my laptop checked out. I mean I spent so much on it. It has to work! I need Danny to come and look at it for me. He is like the computer genius. Speaking of which, I forgot to ask him today what a database is. Today in MIS, I had a guest speaker and she kept using the word database and I didn't know what it meant. I hate computers. I really do. I don't know anything about them and it makes me feel dumb. My neck itches now and so does my head and my hair doesn't look so nice today. I would have had time to straighten it except that my friend Phan wanted to go eat breakfast and so I had to rush. I hear noises in the ceiling. Its probably from the people living above me. At first when I heard noises, I thought they sounded like rats scurrying in the roof but then I realized it can't be the roof because I don't live on the top floor of the dorm. Man I'm glad I don't live in Jester East cause it smells over there. In JEster West it is so much nicer. Gosh, I'm itching all over! I need to shower tonight. My back also hurts. Its been hurting for a while now. I keep asking my friends to give me a massage. I think I have back problems. I hope they aren't severe. I can hear the bathroom door closing even though the bathroom is across the hall. That's the thing I don't like about living in a dorm. You can hear everything all around you. I think my roommate may be coming back cause the door closed and I hear footsteps. The water is dripping in the sink. I can't make it stop. I just realized it right now and its really bothering me. Drip, drop, drip, drop. Its really bothering me now. I just thought of something. I wonder if I'm suppose to be putting indentions and starting new paragraphs for this writing assignment. Oops. I should have thought of it sooner because now its just one really long paper. I hope I don't get points taken off. I hear my cell phone ringing but I'm not going to pick it up. I'll call the person back later I guess. Oh yeah, my cell phone. Its really weird. I set a certain ringer and it does not ring with the ring tone that I picked out. It rings with a totally different one. I don't get it. My roommate just got back and my friend Lena is also hear. I see that she has Starbucks. I love starbucks. I want coffee now. Ooo, coffee. I have this coffee chocolate candy bar. NO one likes it. I don't know why. It tastes so good. People just don't know anything about chocolate. Why did my roommate and Lena leave again? Its quite again and I can hear the water dripping. Man, my arm keeps itching and I have to keep scratching it. They've reentered and now they have just left. I wonder what Jennie and Lena are up to. And she slammed the door again. Geez! Anyway, I just remembered that I'm suppose to call my mom. She told me to call her every night and I've forgotten to call her. So now I've got to call her. ",0
188,"The first thing that comes to my mind is how unbelievably long the web address is to this web page. My gawd!  Now I am wondering if this text box has automatic text wrap-around, because, so far, everything is on one line. Oh, I guess I will have to do it manually, and hit return after every line. Now my roommate Brandon is berating me for not knowing how to format this text. Maybe if I ignore him for long enough, he will go away. My glance has caught the sight of the Daily Texan. What a lousy newspaper. It is really short, and the best-written articles are from the Associated Press. That's really pitiful, because the Associated Press writes the most boring, dry articles on the face of the planet. But that is better than the grammatically incorrect and content-devoid writing of the staff writers. I see that they (ah, the non-descript ""they"") have created a virus that destroys the AIDS virus in at least some instances. Supposedly, this new virus has worked in the testtubes, but they will not test the virus on animals until next month. That brings up the issue of testing on animals. I have mixed feelings about the issue. If only the animals were voluntary to (almost certainly) die, then it would be different. And if the animal testing ultimately leads to the eradication of a disease or virus, then, of course, it is worth it. But that doesn't make it any easier to do such a terrible thing to an animal. I saw a Twenty-Twenty about these apes who had been tested on and then were taught to talk. They were so intelligent, and so smart. They were depressed, and so sad. Poor babies. Why do I call them babies?  Because that implies that they are poor and innocent. I hate the ""dart"" board in our dorm room. It is not a true dart board, but one of those Velcro kind with the plastic balls that never stick. ""Bulls-eye!  Oh, dang it, it fell off. Never mind. ""  That is quite typical. I hate studying!  The thought of it makes me sick to my stomach. I hate to puke!  Just kidding. It's just that I have gotten a little behind in my reading for both astronomy and psychology, so now I am having to read last week's chapters just to get to this weeks. Needless to say, I could use some improvement in my study habits. And the astronomy is so dry!  What up with that, G-dawg in da' house?  You ask any G-dawg, and that dawg will agree straight-up, you know what I'm sayin', fool?  School tomorrow!  I don't even want to think about it, so I won't. Church went well today. I played pretty well, with the exception of jumping the gun on the opening hymn in the 9:30 service today, altogether skipping the call to worship. Oops!  Thank god my salary is not based on number of mistakes. No, actually, I usually do well, and, that mistake notwithstanding, that held true today. I must say, though, the sermon was pretty boring. Especially since I had to hear three sermons. Two is my limit, and three is just too much. Now I am singing in my head. I cannot stopping ""playing"" in my head the new version of ""Candle in the Wind"" that Elton John wrote for Princess Di's funeral. ""It seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind. Never fading in the sunset when the rains set in. ""  I believe it has been twenty minutes, so I'm OUTTA HERE! ",1
650,"Tomorrow I'm going to go back to my hometown of Grapevine, Texas, where I get the chance to revisit some of my old high school friends that are still in high school, and some friends that have graduated as well, that will be home as well. I guess I'm looking forward to the weekend, however I realize that I am still missing a lot of the social activities that are going on at UT. Currently my roommate is pondering why I listen to so much music all the time. To tell you the truth, I really don't know why I do. One of the reasons may be that I grew up surrounded by music, my brother being a person that played a lot of it around the house, as well as the fact that a lof of my friends also listen to music a whole lot. I just saw the MTV music awards, which was ok. I mean it started out cool and such. with three great bands on stage at once, however it kinda declined from there into some trendy mush of junk. Some bands these days I can hardly consider a ""band"" in the least sense of the word. I just remembered that I missed my SI meeting tonight. that which I am not too happy about, but I shall make an even harder attempt to make the next one. Sometimes I wonder why people don't like dorm life that much. I mean its a nice social place where you get to meet people, and sometimes the rooms arent THAT bad. not even in jester, which is supposedly the biggest dorm in the nation or something to that effect. I've been to other places and apartments, and I think I still like mine the best. or maybe its just my way of rationalizing to myself the living conditions that I recieved. I hope my ride back home tomorrow is expedient. I get so darn tired after car rides. you wouldnt think so after sitting down for three or more hours, but you always are. maybe its because the body expects you to be sleeping or something. who knows. I'm also doing laundry at the same time. really different than the laundry back home, seeing as how the dryers take the whole freaking day to dry your clothes. geez, I'll be up for a while. Sometimes I wonder why people can be such jerks to others, especially in relationships. In this summer alone, 4 of my close friends experienced breakups in relationships, either due to faults of their own, or others. 2 of them cheated on the other, which is something that is really bad. I guess the human mind likes to think that when you commit to someone else, you expect the same in return, no matter if you are drunk, stupid, wasted, etc. It's prolly also the lowest of things that one can do to another in a relationship as well. Luckily I was not immediately affected by any of the aforementioned incidents. I never really know what to say to people that get the sharp end of the stick in those situations either. I mean what can you say?? I'm sorry?  you'll do better next time?? hardly. It feels like I'm typing into a diary or something. which I don't keep. I really want to go see some live bands here in austin. I mean it IS supposedly the Live Music Capital of the world. or nation. whichever. its supposed to have something more than just 6th street. at least things in austin aren't that bad. my roommate's pretty cool, better than someone else I could've ended up with. the food. could be better. but its not too bad. Overall university life is pretty ok. a lot of people here are nice and friendly. barton springs is really really REALLY cold. man is it cold. I wish I had something to eat as of right now. I'm kinda hungry. at least the jester express is still open for a while. Some of my friends are wanting to go the jester late night express right now. which is a really good idea. good thing the time thingy is almost over. hopefully my laundry will almost be done as well. I hate doing laundry. I especially hate ironing. but I guess they're something that I'm just going to have to live with for the rest of my lfie. carpe diem. seize the day. dead poets society. a great movie. seizing the day however. I think at least. should only be done in short bursts, and not always. It just seems like looking at the short term benefits or consequences and never at the long term just seems kinda idiotic. right?  Some people I know take it way to the extreme. I wouldnt even know how to write it down. so now I'm wondering who's going to read this paper, and what they're going to think. or if anyone is going to even read it at all? pennebaker? the asian guy? that michelle girl?  who knows. that video that was showed last class was pretty weird. that guy/girl strapped to the machine. and all those brian waves. I guess it wasnt ""weird. "" just something that we don't see that often. it was pretty cool I guess. now I also know how to escape a lie detector test if there was ever a chance that I would be detained by the FBI for some criminal knowledge that I may possess for some odd reason. who knows.

2155,"Wow, I really don't feel like typing for 20 minutes, especially because I can't type all that well. My foot really itches. It is so hot in here, my roommates keep the air up way to high. My hands are sweating, and it takes a lot fir me to sweat. I feel terrible. I really hope that I'm not getting sick. MY nose really itches. BAD! sniffle. I really miss Thomas. I wish he were here right now. Now my elbow itches. And my nose again. This commercial is so gross. I would run the other direction too. my legs are sweaty too. I wonder if the sweat will mess up my keyboard. I wonder where Ky is. gahh I really hope he doesn't like me. He is cool but I just don't want to go past friendship. My eyebrow itches too. man, stuff really itches when you are paying attention to yourself. My shoulder and nose both do. I have a lot of knots in my shoulders too. Maybe Thomas will I have me a massage when I go home this weekend. That hair is on my nerves. I have so much reading to do, I don't think I will ever get caught up. I am really worried about Kim. I hope she can get everything figured out money wise and also with her math. I don't know what I would do if she weren't here. Man my hands are sweaty, it is so hot in here. I wonder what Thomas is doing. He is having that dumb study group at his house tonight so I probably won't be able to talk to him that much. I love him. I wish he would be able to come here and visit. His parents would never let that happen. He is coming to the Nebraska game so maybe him and his dad can come see my place. My arm itches. Now the other one does, and my shoulder. I have a lot of knots. It felt great for them to be rubbed. My nose itches. I am so stopped up. There comes the air, maybe it will cool off. Kari must keep her air on like 80. I cannot type at all! my legs are stuck to this leather couch. I really need to go to Kim's to use her nair. My foot itches. I really need to go work out. I cannot gain weight this year. I need to shave too. I have so much that I need to do, but there's no way I can do it all. My hands are still sweating, but it feels better now that the air came on. Only 3 more minutes. This sweat better not mess up my computer. There goes Jayme's alarm. My eye itches but I can't scratch it because of my make-up. I have to change the TV. felicity just gets on my nerves. My ear itches. and my thigh. and my other ear. and my eye. wow! oooh Friends is on. but so is Trading Spaces. I love that show. Genevieve really gets on my nerves. Oh this is the kids version ugh I sneezed. I guess I will watch Friends now. Oh my 20 minutes is up! yay I can stop     ",1
2172,"Basically right now I am feeling a little bit stressed out. I have to go to this Fiesta tonight for my sorority and I think it will be really fun, but we have to dress up. I have no idea yet what I am going to wear. On top of all of that I have class pretty much all day today. My Freshmen Seminar is really interesting, but we stayed last week for the entire 3 hours and that is just kind of a long time to be hearing about libraries. For some reason I am also feeling kind of overwhelmed by school. I don't know if I am behind or if I will be prepared for the tests or what. I always thought that I would have so much more time in college because I wouldn't be at school for 9 hours a day, but for some reason I never seem to have enough time. And wow, right now I am really tired. I wanted to try to get to sleep kind of early last night so I could wake up early today and get some things done, but of course that didn't happen. I'm also pretty hungry so I need to decide on something to have for lunch. We really need to go to the grocery store because we don't really have any good food. I could go eat in the cafeteria, but for some reason I don't just love that food. I mean it's not really bad, but I just don't really like everything that they  have downstairs. I'm really glad that we have the kitchens in Towers because I like being able to make my own food. Now I'm back to worrying about what I am going to wear tonight. I should have thought about this a lot sooner. I tried to go get something yesterday, but I couldn't find anything. From now on I am going to get all of my costumes together much sooner. My problem is that everyone always goes to do all of that stuff in the afternoon and I always have class in the afternoon. Oh well though! I'm pretty excited about tonight, but I really just don't want to stay out too late. And then one of my friends from high school is coming in to town on Friday so I think that should be really fun. I'm excited to see her. I've been feeling randomly kind of homesick lately, but I am going home for a visit in like 2 weeks and I can't wait! Now I am seriously getting so hungry. As soon as I finish this I am going to make some lunch and I then I have to do some reading. Reading is really the only homework I have, but it is so time consuming and I feel like I always kind of put it off. I don't know why I feel like that because I am not really behind in my reading or anything. oh my, my alarm clock is going off and that is really annoying, I guess I never turned it off. I wonder if there is anyone here. I know my roommate is at class, but I'm not sure whether my suitemates are here or not. It's really quiet so I'm thinking maybe not. I am definitely going to go get a Coke and some lunch after I finish with this. I am so tired, maybe the Coke will wake me up a little bit. Goodness, I just wish I knew what I was going to wear tonight. I think maybe I'll call my sister later and see what she thinks. I just don't know though. My Zeta Bud never called me which is strange, but I can't go to the activity today anyway because I have class. Oh well. I think someone just walked in. I wonder which one of my roommates is here. I will have to go check on that and then I have a lot to do before my class at 2. I also need to find a map to where I am supposed to go for my Seminar discussion today. ",0
1399,"Today I woke up to the sun sinning in to the room and it gave me much joy. the warm sun rays lighting up the room starts a day off very nicely. sweetie now that made me feel all warm and fussy in side. I just had to sit back and take it in for a few moments before closing the chat window. she called me sweetie, Wow! I hope she knows that made me feel special. I hope I make her feel special. because she is special to me. JoAnna what a unique name. It is a lovely name. one with two capital letters. laptops, this is so cool I am typing on a laptop, I wish I could have my own. maybe I could save some money some how. I wonder if my mom will give me some for it. hmmm. must likely not. my sis is doing better. she needs to eat more healthy. this summer was a great summer. God really blessed me. I worked a lot help on the house met one great family and to great friends in it. I got all the classes I wanted to switch in to these fall. so awesome. God is awesome. I am so bless through his love. I pray I make the most of it and continue be focused. I have so much time and yet I always want things faster. I seem to want it now. but time and patients will help me through. Sweetie wow I just can't get over it. I am so lucky to have some like that in my life. just to look at her brings me joy. and those eyes. I love getting lost in those eyes. what if I didn't say anything? will she turn away? will she be embarrassed? I hope not. does she feel the same way? If she does is this the one? or maybe it is another I have not met. I wish I knew. I have to be patient. all good things come in time. I wonder if she knows that I wonder what she is doing sometimes. does she do the same? when can I see her again. when is too soon to talk to her. what is to much? who knows! her smile is so beautiful. no wonder I am so at tracked to her. the smile is the first things I notice in a girl. and my mom likes her too, what are the odds. something must be right. maybe I thinking too far ahead. all I now is I like it. I like JoAnna and she likes me. That is what I know. I know I want to see more of her but that will have to go slow because school is why I am here in Austin. maybe over Christmas we can see more of each other. ",1
1760,"RIght now I'm thinking about not that much. I'm actaulyl ratehr relaxed. I'm thinking about how I miss my boyfirend, even though he is jsut on the otehr side of the room. It's one of those thigns where you're just really happy about a person and you can't stop thinking about them. He's just sitting there playing a video game and I'm really excited, but yet I still miss him and think about him. It's a rather cool feeling. I'm also thinking about my writting assingment in my rhetoric class. I've been trying to find stuff for it all day, and it's driving me crazy,a nd I still have more homework to do for it later, so that is still on my mind. I'm thinking also that I want to listen to music. Music relaxes me a lot, and I really enjoy listening to it will I'm doing mindless things. I enjoy it at other times too. I'm also craving sweets a lot. I'm addicted to them, so that's not really that unusual. I'm trying to rmemeber where a resturatnt is in Houston. Prior to this I read an email from my mother telling me about wehre her and my father ate for their 30th weding anneversary, but I couoldn't really htink of where it is. I'm also trying to think about waht kind of food htey sereve. Earlier in teh day I watched hte first half of hte TExns game, so I'm also wondering if they won or not. My sister is also awayu at college, we're twins, and I'm wondering if any day things willl get better. It's the first time we've been apart and she's having a miserable time, so I'm wondering constantly how she's doing,a nd what I can do to make it better for her. Randomly I also think about my parents. I just read an email from one of htem, so taht's why they are currently on my mind. Normally I wouldn't miss them, but my dad had a heart attack a few days before I moved up here, so I think about him a lot more htat I probably would. My email from my mom realated to how they're eating, so that got me thinking on that. I'm also thinking about my math class. I have homework to do in tehre later tonight. I really don't like the calss. It's riddle math, so I spend my time wondering about how I'm going to get thropugh there. Currently I  m trying to think of how to jsut get through my homework, muchless my tests. THer are no equations, so it drives me crazy. I really don't want to even look at my homework. It's about the only homework I've procratinated on since I  ve been here. I'm also wondering what is wrong with me in my current medical condition. I have dizzyness problems, and I'm trying ot think of a time when I can see a doctor. My sister is having them now too, so it's on my mind a lot more. Now I'm starting to feel stressed. Usually I don't feel stressed, but then again I usually don't write out things that have been flowing through my mind. I'm wondering if I can think of things to talk about for twenty minutes. It's actually somewhat hard given that it's only me talking, well typing and there is no one or anything to converse with on the other end. I'm also trying to figure out when I'll have time to get my boyfriends birthday gift. I've spent all day, and all week,a nd the past montsh trying to figure it out. But now   m going to go to  a store tommorrow to finally get something. But I'm worrying about if the store will actually have somethign that I can get. I've never been to this store, but at 5 tommorrow I will find out about the stuff int ehre. According to my firned she says that I'll be able to find stuff there. Hopefully I will, otehrewise I'll have to rushdeliver something here, and that cost extra money,a nd I'm constantly worrying about money. I am botehrd especially when I have to pay for unneccessary things. Which the extra shipping cost would fall into that category. I'm also thinking about what position I would like to run for. Earlier today I went to an RHA meeting. Unfortuantly I missed the first half, so I didn't get all the information. I'm thinking about being something for my wing, which is good if I want to be an RA next year. THe other positions seem like high positions where I would have to campaign a lot, and I  m not that type of person. I'm still worrying somewhat about if I would have to campaign for my wing thing. I really would preffer to do that, I just hope I don't lose to someone who just casually felt like running for it, and wasn't as into it as me. Kind of like the girls who I think of who voted not to keep the bathroom door unlocked. THose eveil people. Everytime I go to the bathroom, I really hate them, and wish they weren't so casual about their voting no. Everyone had to vote yes, otherwise it would remain unlocked. Rather unfair. But I really get annoyed even when I see them. I've been sitting in front of htis computer too long today doing school work. I  m actaully quite frustrated with the internet. I needed to find a very simple thing, but yet the search engines would not co-operate and gave me horrible feedback for the sites. THe noise of hte video game in the background is rather interesting. I'm not much into video games, unless I get to shoot something, but I still wonder what's going on over there. Or how guys are entrigued for hours by a simple mouse or control set. The same screen, all day long. I've wondered if it actually   fries   people's brains when they play. Or if it interferes with their education, as in if they played video games their whole childhood. The noises on the video game are starting to remind me of hte noises that my boyfriend makes. I'm wondering howmuch time the wing representative will take. Supposedly it's only one hour, but I wonder if there's something hidden in tehre. I'm not sure if I'll be able to manage that, flag football, with practices nad games, and a soccer team with my floor. I'm not sure how to tell my best friend if I dont' want to play. I do want to play, I just don't know if I'll have the time. But I also wnat to meet peoiple on my floor and spend time with my best friend. So that is a rather hard argument. Why does life have so many conflicting htings, and not enough hours in teh day. I want to just expand time, and do everythign I want, and stop rushing through it and      ",1

I wish that I never sined up for this classs as a freshman. I wish I could go home and not be stuck in a place like this and I wish things could change for me. I don't know how I am supposed to think about the way I think. I think thats stupid no one understans fully how the brain works. no one will ever understand the way I work and I wish they would all stop trying. I live my life for everyone else iu thats wrong, but I can't ever live up to any expectauions and it upsets me. I will most likely grow up to become a psyco! thats all. I'm stopping now.

1014,"Today was fun. it was more fun than usual. Psychology is a fun class. I had more fun in than usual. Poor Tracy. I feel so bad for her. Why do guys treat her the way they do. She's such a good girl. If I were a guy, I would be happy to have a girl like her. maybe it's because at times she can be submissive. it seems like guys always want a challenge in life. How awkward. oh well I hope she transfers soon. I hate Judy. she's such a bitch. I dunno how she is going to become a psychologist. Gross. she's so insensitive and mean. i have no clue how she is going to become a psychologist. Aren't psychologists supposed to be nice, friendly, understanding, etc. ?? Well anyways. i just found another person with Charlie's birthday. i was reminded of him once again. Gosh he's such an asshole. i'm so happy I left him. i don't know what he's thinking. Why the hell would I ever want to get back with a shit head like him. He's so stupid. oh wells. i miss my mommy. it seems like I love her a lot lot more now that I'm away from home. I finally realize how much she loves me and devotes herself to me. oh well. i'm going to show her I love her a lot more eventually. i miss her so much. sometimes I wish I could just hold her and stuff but I guess not. Gosh this psycology class requires a lot of writing and etc. oh wells. wow I can't believe I met another Japanese girl like me. hehe. she's so nice and cute =) Anyways, I better study harder in all my classes or I'm going to completely fall behind in all my classes. the other Charles is stupid but he's fun to hang out with. why am I such an abusive person. it's like I always like to hit people and pinch them. oh well. Hung is really sad. well that's what Thao and Tracy says. what can I say. He shouldn't have said all the things he said. He's so dumb. typical guy I suppose. why did he say the things he said anyways. He really hurt my feelings. i may seem like I'm not a sensitive person, but I am so sensitive and some of the smallest things get to me. that really sucks. Grrrr!!! I hate my step dad. He's so superficial and stupid. i hope his son doesn't come to Houston and live with us. that would suck so bad. i really have no idea what I would do. He would definitely mess up the whole family. i wonder what Charles is doing right now. i wonder if he really does have feelings for me like he says. i wonder if he still thinks about me and stuff. He's such a dickhead. i bet h already slept with another girl already. Grrrr. what a damn loser. He's almost 24 years old yet he is still a junior. i really would not be suprised if I graduated before he did. hehe. michael is a really nice and cool guy. i'm glad I met him. i wonder if he is gay. that really sucks. guys who usually talk about their fatness usually seem to be gay. i have no clue though. i kinda miss Charlie pooh. oh well I must forget about him. i really need to catch up on my studies I must make a 4. 0 gpa so I can get into a good med school with scholarships and etc. Gosh Poor Catherine. i know her and Eric are having problems. it's just that she doesn't want to admit it. Everytime I bring the subject of him, she tries to avoid it like she doesn't care but I know she does. oh well Poor girl. i hope we have fun this weekend. that would be really great. Yup =) Ok now. it seems like I am running out of ideas to write for this class. i need a haircut bad. Hehe. oh my god I can't believe 90210 is still showing . that's pretty amazing. it's the 10th year since its been running. wow. Jenny Garth is still my idol. she's soo pretty and she dresses so nice and is skinny. i want to lose another 10 lbs. then I will be soo happy. the girl from party of 5 has really grown. i love her hair. thats the next haircut I'm going to have. it looks so nice. ok now. i think it's been 20 minuties and I'm tired of writing so I'm going to go now. byebye =) ",0
2431,"     I enjoy doing writing assignments liek these. You get to write about just about anything that pops into your mind. the bad part about this type of assignment is when you really don't have anything to think about or when you have a brian fart. I wounder just how my performance in this class is going to be. Whether I will do poorly in the class or good or just average enough to pass the class. But among those thought, I also wounder how this semester is going to go. I hope that I am going to be able to do well enough to bring my GPA up so that I am able to get more scholarships fo next year. Man, when I notice what I am thinking about, I notice that I really think about things that may affect me in certain ways. Like doing homework for my classes or whether or not I'm going to have enough money to pay my rent or my cell phone bill or my other bills. But as I take the time to think, I feel that I will be forced to get another job so that I will be able to afford all this new responseablity that I have taken on. Its not always easy to write exactly what your thinking about a certain time. But right now its hard for me to do anything when all I'm thinking about it how bad I feel right now. Right now I have a stuffed and runny nose, and I am also sore from working out on wensday. It hurts for me to walk up the stairs or to strech out of to even lift up anything heavy. I think I worked myself out a little too much, I feel that I tried to push myself a little more then I should have since it was my first day working out since last semester. I think I screwed myself by not continuing to workout over the summer break. All I did was work to pay off some of my bills that I acquired over last semester for books and other various reasons. Its funny how when you set yourself to doing something and son't pay attention to the time, time really seems to fly by. Take this assignment for example. I started to write what I was thinking and now that I look at how long I've been writing, I've noticed that I have already been writing for a little over 16 minutes now and it does even seem like it. It merely seems like I've been writing for about 5 minutes. If all the assignments were like this one, I bet pretty much every one would do good, cause its not hard to talk about what your thinking about at a particular time. You can just about write about anything you want, whether it is a event happening in your life or just something you feel like getting off your chest, all you have to to is merely just type it in and be able to get it off your chest and get a grade while doing it too.

1135,"Boy Bands  They suck big time. I'm listening to the radio right now and one of the 50 is on. I do not see the huge interest in them. They all seem fake since New Kids on the Block. They were the original hotties! I can't tell if it's my allergies or if I'm getting sick, but my nose has been running ever since this past weekend. I got to go see my niece and nephew this weekend. I really enjoyed that. For once I got to go out of town on Labor day. My parents always said next year, or later this year. I'm amazed we got out of Texas this year. We were supposed to go to Italy this summer, but that fell through. Then we were supposed to go to New York, and that didn't feel right. Then we all finally decided on Orlando. My brother was going to bring his girlfriend and we were all going to have a great weekend break from the routine. That didn't work either. We ended up cutting that one to. Finally we decided that it was our turn to go to California to see my nieces and nephews. It was fun, but they sure are weird. I have an older half brother, an older half sister, and an older halfhalf sister. We really aren't related, but we are still pretty close. We have a lot of fun together. I don't talk to my half sister anymore. She's a bit. Sorry. She's mean and selfish. She told me that I stole her dad from her. She has some serious problems. She has to be the center of attention, and she's always trying to be better than everyone else. If something good is happening between two people she has to stir things up. She's a complete brat. She's too used to getting everything her way. I hope my roommate can't see up my shorts. I don't know if this is something that happens with time, but I really don't like underwear anymore. I don't understand how some people can wear the granny kind of underwear. Sorry if I am offending you. But hey, this is my stream of consciousness. I'm really looking forward to this class. My mom had a lot of fun teaching it. I've always wanted to be like her in some way or another. I've always looked up to her. Somehow she is always right. There are the few occasions, but for the most part she's always right. Sometimes it makes me sick. I'm running out of things to talk about. Hmmm. I miss my friends from Wimberley. I'm a freshman. So many of my friends went to different schools or are still in high school. I was the oldest in my group of friends. My parents keep telling me how some of the girls are looking up to me, and want to be like me when they get to college. I love to hear that kind of stuff. It really keeps me in check. Yeah! One of the songs I always sing with a girl I hung out with all summer is on. It's weird, but it seems like juniors and freshmen always hook up. I don't mean like going out, but also in just hanging out. It seems like there's always two years in between close friends. I have a friend who just turned 16 and she is so pumped. I feel really bad, because her mom and step dad are getting divorced right now. She just moved from her last home. I'm pissed at her step dad. He said that he wanted a divorce because he felt he wasn't providing enough for his child, which is crap!. He gave her everything she ever asked for, plus some. So now he has put my friend, her mom, and her brother out in the cold. He's a jerk. I'm not going to go any more into this subject. I'd get too heated. This time has really passed pretty fast. I'm surprised! I don't get why people drink alcohol. I just don't get it. I have plenty of fun sober. Sometimes more fun than my friends have, and they have hang overs the next day. It makes no sense to me. Being sober's the way for me! Well, this was fun. I'll chat with you later! ",0
353,"Is there a reason?  These questions have been filling my mind often lately. When I talk to my friends about it they say that they have the same problem. Is this a problem that every young man encounters?  It kin of scary because maybe I'll never find out. Also, can I ever be satisfied. Whenever I gain something I find my self always wanting more. I am incomplete. I have pushed many limits and yet have found no real answers. Some say a man with out a purpose will drive himself insane. Maybe , a man with all the answers has no purpose.  ",1
2153,"Hey what is up. Just writing my homework. I wanted to get it done before I forgot. I hate when I forget to do homework. Most of it is pretty easy but I just have bad memory sometimes. I write things down now in a little blue spiral that fits in my back pocket. I like to write down things in there that I feel are necessary to remember. Today I watched a movie called  The Rules of Attraction "". It was cool. It was meant to be one of those ""teen movies"" but it told things on a more real basis. Most teen movies end with happy endings and the main characters fall in love. Life is not like that always though. It consisted of a big love triangle that went terribly wrong. I cannot spell very well. I like microsoft Word because it makes those wavy red lines underneath words that I screwed up on. My computer is making a funny noise. My head hurts. I am running out of ideas to write about. 4 minutes 22 seconds. Still a while to go. I get my braces off in 2 days. I cannot wait. If you have never had braces, take it from me, they suck. Imagine not being able to smile for one year. It sucks really bad. I like music. My roommate is playing some music on his computer right now. He was playing a cool song but he turned it off and is playing something crappy. I told him to change it back but he did not. Now he did. Sweet. 6 min 8 seconds. Still a while to go. When I started this I did not know how much I could write in 20 minutes. I can remember assignments in high school that I would write in under 20 minutes. I really had an easy time in high school. It was fun. My school was small nothing like it is here. I lived in Little Elm, Tx, which is in the dallas area. I liked it there but Austin is so much better. I want to go to school here and finish my major (kinesiology) and go to graduate school in California. I really want to check that place out. Most people that go to school here have become Longhorn fans but I have been a fan as long as I can remember. That is cool and all but it just seems like they go to games and like the team just because they are wining. I can remember seasons where the Longhorns would win only 4 games. It sucked but you have to stick with a team. My roommate is asking me how to work the dvd player in the living room. I wonder if the teacher is actually going to read this. That was funny how that kid did not even write anything he just pasted something on the screen. good times. 11 min 20 sec. Today is Wednesday. 9/3/03. September 11 is coming up again. I read on the internet that 9/11 was a drug deal gone bad with George Bush Jr. and Osama Bin Laden. Heroin is a major export out of the middle east. The USA Gov't controls the drug flow weather we like to believe it or not. Heroin was the largest import into the United States in 2001. I bet you did not know that. Something went wrong so terrorist attacked us. I wonder if the truth will ever come out. George is a moron. If I ever saw him I would call him that. I would probably say f-ing moron. I hope he would get mad. I do not like him. I also believe he is a member of illuminati. One the one dollar bill, there is a picture of a triangle with and eye in it. The eye is a symbol that represents the devil's eye. Also in bar codes, there are three lines that represent 666. That kind of shows how evil money is and everything we buy we are supporting the devil. These are just some crazy conspiracy theories I believe. I also believe that we have not been to the moon. Woogie from borrington high. Sorry my roommate is watching Something About Marry and that is a line from it. Have you seen my baseball. 17 min 23 secs. I am getting close. So what up. I rented two movies from blockbuster. I am hungry. after I am done with this I will eat. No eat. eat eat eat. I like to eat. This is getting boring. I am almost done though. It is almost time to go. I got really drunk on Friday night and threw up in front of the building we have this class. I tried to walk home from the fraternity houses. I made it to the stadium and passes out. Eventually my roommate picked me up. It was good times. And I am done ",0
1537,"     Well, I am sitting here fighting with myself about whether or not I should go out tongight. It looks like i will probably give in and go to the KA house. I don't think I should because I have a lot of work to do. I am excited to go and see my grandmother tomorrow. I miss my friends a lot especially justin. I am wondering why I haven't been able to get a hold of him. so I don't have a lot on my mind, but this is fun because I get to listen to all of the music I just downloaded. our tv in the living room is super loud! I can hear it over my music and through a closed door. Things with bryan seem to be going well, but I definitely don't see things progressing too much further. I am really tired today. I should be sleeping a lot more than I have been. oh well. I need to do my devotional before I go anywhere tonight because I will feel really bad if i forget. I am very concerned about justin. I cannot stop thinking about what our issues are or aren't. I wonder what my parents are doing tonight. I miss seeing them every day, but at least I talk to them a lot. It feels super weird to be away and completely on my own, but I think I will surprise myself at how well I will do. That pizza that I ate earlier was not good. I guess it doesn't settle well because I don't eat it very often. I am so excited about my KIN class. It is so awesome, and I love that the professors are married and christians. That's so great. Paige is really cool, too, and I am very glad that she is in that class with me. I hope we end up hanging out a lot this year. I was so worried about meeting people who loved God, and it's been really reassuring so far. The tri-delts are perfect girls for me. They're so good, and they have 3 bible studies!  Yea!  Elton John is really talented. It cracks me up that I've gotten so into this computer business. It's really fun, though. I got my first email today. Who better from but Sebastian?  He's awesome, but it sucks that he lives in Chile. Okay, I am having a lull. I really feel very exhausted, but of course I will go out as soon as I finish this assignment. It is so stupid how vain I have gotten since I have been here, but I am sure that that will go away after a little time. I am so nervous about taking my first tests. I love all of my classes, but I wonder about how prepared I am from high school, and how well my study habits will allow me to do. This assignment is really very cool. I thought it would  take forever, but the time is flying. So I am very cold right now; surprise, surprise. I think of my girls from Kerrville every time that I begin a sentence with so. I definitely should not do that very much. My mother would not be proud of me.   Unchained Melody   must be one of the most romantic songs ever recorded. It makes me miss Justin. I suppose I will try to call him again right now. ",1
1228,"I just woke up and I'm a little confused as I try to figure out what subject I should be studying and which assignments I should be working on. This is all new to me. High school was nothing like this, never had to study. Now I really know what stress is supposed to feel like. Not that the classes are tough yet. I guess I'm used to being lazy. The food here is getting old and I'm scared of gaining that ""freshman 15. "" Tonight family is coming in, can't wait, a nice paid for meal. Lately I've been feeling sad. I parted from my 2 best friends a month ago to be here and now I can see how much I really depended on them. My life is so different. I have to try and fit into the friendships that were already made here this summer during provisionals. It's not fun. They're all in the sorority and I'm sick of going out every night. I talked to my best friends Amy and Christa everyday either on the phone or Internet. I don't know what I'd do without AIM. I miss them so much. I'm going home this weekend I need to see some familiar faces. I'm not one to be homesick I just feel I have no sort of comfort zone here even though I should. I mean my brother lives here but has his own life with his job and girlfriend. So I barely get to see him ever. I've been really sad the past 2 weeks. It's just been really hard. My boyfriend of 8 months is in the Marines and lives in 29 Palms, California. He doesn't get much time off with his new duties that he was promoted to so he had 96 hours off during Labor Day weekend and drove 1600miles to see me. I can't even believe it still, that 21hour drive had to be horrible. That's what keeps me going everyday. How much I can see by the way he's shown me, how much he cares and loves me that he would come all the way here. He finally bought a cell phone so we could talk easier instead of him waiting in the 2hour phone lines they have at the payphones everyday. He's also getting a job for his days off at a western wear store. He wants more money, he's so responsible, as if being in the marines isn't hard enough work already. Its really expensive with all the gas to drive here all they time and the flights are just crazy. I'm going to try and fly there for his birthday. I know my parents would absolutely kill me. I love him so much and we're of different religions so almost for a year now I've had to deal with my parents. I can't stand it, its drives me crazy inside sometimes how disapproving they are of someone they won't even get to know. It's not fair to me. They should be happy as long as he makes me happy. I would never not be with someone because of a religion that they were born into. Not to mention, the fact that we're both not deeply committed to our religions or were brought up that way. I can feel the tension and hurt coming up in the future. When he gets out we will be very close. He'll go to Southwest and we'll be together everyday, hopefully for the rest of our lives. I don't know, its just one more thing added on to my stress factors. Sometimes it's just easier to cry it all out but when I let that happen sometimes it lasts for almost 24 hours straight and I make myself sick. I've been sick all week and I hate it. I should be studying and I can't focus or keep myself to concentrate. I have to learn. I have to stick with it. I've decided I'm not going to go out at night unless it's a big function that I care about. It's not worth it. The party scene is old. I've been coming up to Austin the past 4 years for the big parties, pat O's, Atlantic city, and they just don't do anything for me anymore. I guess that would probably be because I don't drink and I don't' care to ""hook up"" with anyone so basically since those are the 2 main reasons that those fraternities have parties, they really just don't interest me. I'm personally fine with going to dinner with a couple of my girlfriends and renting a sappy movie and eating a lot of junk food. But that's just me. Something I do love here though is that I don't shower to go to class, don't get dressed up nor have I touched my make up bag since I left home. How fun is that? I love it. I just really don't care. Basically my plan is to try and focus on my studies, I won't have any boys here to distract me cause the only one I love isn't here. I'll do well in school and in the end we'll be able to be together. He has about 1 year and 10months left, but I figure I can make it. I mean he's already been in there for 2yrs and 2months and I've stood by his side the entire time, even before he joined. He means the world to me. I just can't even imagine my life without him and that's why I plan on staying with him. I know people think I'm dumb, that I'm wasting my college years staying committed to a long distance relationship, but I don't know why it would be dumb. As long as I'm happy why should I care right? I don't know, this whole college thing is really going to take some getting used to. I mean, me, doing my own laundry? That's just funny. ",0
1917,"It is 4:07 and I am supposed to be in psychology right now. When I got out of class at 3 I just walked to the bus and came home. Then at 4 I realized that I had skipped class. I have no idea how I could do that without even realizing it. My mind is working too fast and I am too focused on other things. Maybe starting Adderral again yesterday had some effect. It speeds up my thoughts rather than focusing them on the matter at hand. Now I'm not sure if that is going to be as helpful to me with school as it will be harmful. My apartment is too quiet. I just wrote to Coody and asked him to play a Modest Mouse song next time. He won't. That would be too weird for everyone. I would have volunteered to be class dj if I thought everyone wouldn't hate it and glare at me. I was also afraid my cd's would skip. They're all scratched. I can't believe I missed class, especially by accident. I feel ridiculous. Especially since I don't know anyone in the class to get notes from. Or I probably do but I don't know it because there are 500 people in there. I wonder. It has only been 4 minutes and 16 seconds, this feels a lot longer than I thought it would. I'm writing a lot more than I thought I could. Friendster is improving my typing, that's a depressing thought. I need to get off the internet and study. I need to study the Jeffersonian idea, how interesting. I think if I could go back and stop the manufacturing and the advance of technology I would. It would be so nice to live off my own land, to be self-sufficient. I wish I could have started that way, because I'm too selfish to give it all up now. It would be impossible as well. The world doesn't leave room for that anymore. Anti-Flag sang about the kid saying, If you hate America so much, why don't you move to Russia?!"" Ignorance is funny. My foot itches. I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow morning after philosophy. I really don't want to go. Or I wish there was no reason for me to go. I am never healthy for more than a week straight. There is always something wrong, something to deal with, worry about, or panic over. I am so tired of that. 8 minutes and 22 seconds, almost half way. This is very strange. I haven't done this since 7th grade. Then it wasn't for 20 minutes and it was more like ""poetic"" rambling, not full sentences. This is strange because my mind is going way faster than my fingers. My typing is not good. I never learned to keep my fingers on the ""home keys"", and for that Mrs. somebody smacked me on the head with her rolled up papers. That was special. Now I am halfway through. Is halfway a word? I think it is two words. Oops. I have so much work to do; it is overwhelming. I could stay in all weekend and finish it, but then I might go stir crazy. Plus so many people want to meet me this weekend. I don't want to meet anyone with this stuff on my face. I felt good until I got it, now I really don't want anyone looking at me. And now the antibiotics are making the rest of me worse. Plus my face is not getting any better. I am looking forward to the vegan potluck anyway though. Maybe it will be dark in there and I can be a little bit more comfortable. I wish Ross and Jimmy weren't going though. The sound of typing is starting to annoy me and make me space out. I wish they weren't going because I want to meet all new people without anyone who knows the ""old me"". And without anyone who will report back to Drew. I want to feel free, not be looking over my shoulder. This is so frustrating. I was so glad to move away from everyone, and three people followed me here. And now probably another will. No, I want only new friends. Not that I don't like the old, I just want to move own. I don't want to be tied down to one me forever. I have never gotten a fresh start in my life and college is the time to do it. After it will be way too hard because I won't meet people. After school people don't really make an effort to reach out and make friends and involve people. What do you do when you meet someone new? Do 35 year olds go around exchanging phone numbers and hanging out? Maybe they do, I don't know. But I wanted to start over and now I can't. And there is nothing I can do about it. Absolutely nothing. Now my face itches. Car tires are screeching outside. The bus driver drove us home in an insane manner today. He told us to hold on, and we did. It was strange. Now it's been 17 minutes. Birds are chirping outside. Something in my room just made a noise. Ramsi is sleeping under her box. She was out eating this morning. It was cute. I feel good that I've given her a better home. I need to go shopping for some new clothes and I really need to cut my hair before everyone I know does it, and then I look like I'm copying everyone. I hate that. I think I'll cut it chin length and get blonde highlights. I need to find a Goodwill to shop at. But I bet all the good clothes are bought up in Austin. I don't want to go to one of those expensive vintage stores on the drag though. Oh, less than 40 seconds left. Now I'm just thinking about the forty seconds and where I'm going to get cut off and that's strange. Is it going to stop me? Or am I ",0
1521,"     I feel like I am under a lot of stress right now at this time. All that I have been doing is wondering if I am going to make it through college alright. I am very hungry at this time. I do not know if I will get something to eat right after I am done with this assignment or if I will wait until I have done some other homework from another one of my classes. I know that I will have to get something very soon because I can smell the food that my friend is eating over there in the corner. I smells sooooo good that my stomach feels like it will never stop making the noises that it is making until I give some food to it. I feel sort of tired at this point in the day. I have just recently finished all of my classes which begin early in the morning and do not finish until late in the afternoon. That is sort of a good thing because I get a big break in the middle of the day, but I would rather get my school day over with early so that I could do homework at any time that I want to instead of being forced to do it right after class. The reason that I have a schedule that is this way is because I went to one of the last sessions of orientation and I did not get the times for the classes that I wanted. Right now my eyes are sort of getting tired because I am not used to typing for this many minutes straight without a single break. Usually when I type I will take a lot of breaks and I will waste a lot of time that I should not be wasting. Therefore, I guess that this is a beneficial assignment because it is teaching me something that I am not used to doing. There are many assingments that I am not used to doing that I have had to do for all of my classes. I get a lot of math homework, which is something that is completely different from high school. Back in high school I really did not have that difficult of a time with the work that I was given. I feel now that I will have to work very hard to attain grades similar to my high school ones. The reason that I figure this is because I have talked to many people that used to go to the University of Texas. Some say it is not that hard, but the majority of the people that I talk to say that I will have to work my tail off if I want to be at the top. They have said that everyone is just as smart as me at this school. I feel that this fact is a good thing. I like to be challeged against others who are at the same level as me or above. I feel that if I work hard that I can do anything that my mind imagines. I think that all people should have that kind of confidence because everyone in this world is worth something. Maaaannnn, I am really really really hungry because that food smells really good. I think that I am going to go and get something to eat after I finsh this assignment. I may have a burger or a few tacos or something. Whatever I get to eat, I know that it will be delicious because my stomach is turning and wishing for something to be put in it right now. I forgot to tell myself that my left foot hurts a whole lot. Yesterday I dropped a big can on the top of my foot and it swelled up a little bit and it still kind of hurts when I walk for a long time on it. I know that if I just gave it a little time to rest that it would probably be fine, but I have an active life and I really cannot do that. ",1
978,"I really enjoy college life, I love being away from my parents but my boyfriend is still in dallas and I miss him so much that it hurts. Sometimes I feel as though I am alone and that this college world is so enormous it feels intimidating. psychology has been an interest for me since I was in middle school because when I was younger there were six guys who came up to me and my brother and asked us for our money and then pproceeded to hit my brother. this experience was very traumatizing to me and after that I went to my school counselor to talk to her about it all she helped me so much that I really got interested in what all the mind does and what one mind can do to another through therapy I went to my medical terminology class today and I was so tired because I stayed up until like 330 last night and now I am very tired and would like to just go to sleep, but I have another class college is completely different from high school I never believed people that said that until I got here ever since I have been here all I think about is my boyfriend and how I wish he was here and my studies I am really getting serious about school and I am excited about my years to come because I love the environment of everyone caring about school and their studies which is completely different than what people thought of in high school I love this environment I am in the computer lab right now doing this assignment  I hope I am doing this right even though it says there are no right or wrong answers to this writing assignment  this weekend jovan, my boyfriend's uncle is having his wedding party and I am going home for it at 500 I have to meet my brother at his fraternity house to get the car so I can get on the road to dallas I am excited about seeing everyone and everyhting but the drive by myself kinda makes me nervous just as long as I don't have to drive in the dark for a long time I will be okay cause it just kinda scares me when I am driving a long way in the dark by myself I did that survey thing for this class the pretesting last night on my friensd natalies computer and I thought it was pretty funny some of it the spider part actually made me scared even though I have never really had a fear of spiders before not like I was extremely scared of it but itr made me start thingking about spiders for a moment this day has been so busy it feels like anyway but then again I have had worse  I wonder if I will really fulfill my dreams of becoming a psychiatrist or what will happen in my future I know that me and jovan are going to get married in probably about 5 or 6 years - I hope anyway he is moving down here next year so we can be together I love him more than anything - everything about him my best friend is in utah right now at byu and I miss her so much I just read her email a few minuites ago and she is having a blast I wont get tosee her until christmas and it will only be for like 2 days because she has to go to california and then she has a football game to go to she is in band there with my friend john I was in band in high school but there was no way I was going to be in band in college because I really didnt like it that much in high school my parents wanted me to stay in it me and my mom have been arguing a lot lately and it has really bothered me but I think and hope things are getting better since italked to her last night this weekend is going to be so busy tomorrow I am going to take jovans car tot he shop to get something done to it while he is at work and then I am going to go help his family get ready for the big day on saturday then saturday we are going to party all day and sunday I need to study all day I have studied all week but I need to review for monday cause I have a quiz in medical terminology over suffixes prefixes and roots my first college quiz!!

903,"Computers, I hate them. Today has been a very fustrating day. Hours spent on waiting on people. Hours that I have wasted. I am nerous about not what is coming soon. I have so much work to do. I still don't have my Organic Book for organic. Gosh, I am so behind and the first exam is coming up really soon and I still haven't study for it. Worries, how come people have to have all different kind of worries. Isn't that dumb. I need to start studying soon. I guess I just work sleep tonight. Stay up for a while studying. I also got to understand Mirco. I am also behind in mirco. School. ahhh. Oh well, school is ok, but I really miss my friends in Purdue. They call and write but I really miss them. Everytime I talk to them I feel like flying back to Purdue. hehe Larmie just said something funny. I am hungry. I didn't eat dinner coz I was on the phone waiting for the people on the computer to help me. I have this . I forgot. Anyway. I really miss everything in Purdue. My friends and that fall is coming. My friend just wrote me and told me about how fall is coming. That makes me very jealous coz fall is my favorite season and I won't be able to enjoy it. I am stuck here in Texas, hot hot hot. Gosh, I really miss Purdue. Evi, Jerry, everyone one else. I am getting annoy. I am using a friends comp coz my doesn't work now. anyway her boyfriend is online and wants to talk to her but I am using it doing this assignment but he keep on making these noise. My friend is on the phone talking to a friend from back home. I . can't wait until thanksgiving or xmas. Coz then my friends from PUrdue is coming to visit me and I am planni to visit them on xmas. One thing I like aobut UT, I guess, is that we have 5 weeks off. That is good. But if I go to work, I probably won't be able to go to IN. I want to eat, I guess, I will after I finish with  this assignment. her boyfriend is making knocking noises now. I really want to tell him that I am doing an assignment now but then he will keep on asking and then I will waste my time, but he is really getting on my nerves. I don't want to be rude to him, since I am using my friends comp and he is her boyfriend. I still thinking about Purdue. How I miss that stupid place. I use to complain how I don't like it that much. But now, I trhink in many ways it is better than UT. I guess it is because I am not use to this place and that I haven't met that many friends yet. I don't think I will met that many friends now. Coz the people in my classes are either junior or senior. Some sophomore but not much. They all have there own group already and I guess they are not really interested in meeting anymore people. I just reply to her boyfriend and I don't know what I was going to say. Oh, well, Oh, people here I guess they are not in the stage where they want to make that many new friends. I understand coz if I were them I guess I won't either. If I was in Purdue, I probably won't make any new friends coz I already have my own. They know me and right now,here I still don't care much coz I still have friends back home. Not really home coz home is now in Texas. I wish I was back there sometimes but I also glad I am here, maybe I get to learn to be more independent. If I was in PUrdue right now, I probably don't have to worry about the comp coz I will have plenty of friends helping me setup. I don't even have to do it myself. I think I might learn something from this. I hope I do, coz if not, I will be upset coz going though all this and still don't know hope to fix the mistake I will feel useless. I don't want to feel useless. wow I think I am really hungry coz my stomach is making a lot of noise. Maybe in a few more minutes I can go to eat. i have to eat noodles, I guess it isn't that bad. After that I think I will go do assignment 2 and then I will go study , can't study orgo, coz I don't have the book, maybe microbiology. I need to understand that. I hope I can find someone who can help me with  my problems. Just some friends like I have in Purdue, who cna help me when I need help. Some people who understand computers, some who can help me with  classes and some who can help bring me places. Hmmm I wonder if I will make those kind of friends. If so, I hope soon. Until then, I guess I will miss PUrdue a lot. well, got to go eat coz I am really hungry. I think , I hope this is long enough. ",1
668,"ok, so my grandfather died yesterday. why don't I feel sad yet. what is wrong with me, do I have no conscionce?  When my mother told my sister and I, she told us like we should pitty her, not like we should also be sad, what the f*** he was my grandfather. it was all about her, when can you come down to houston to watch the animals, so I can go to the funeral, not, do you wnat to come with me to the funeral?  how can she possible be so selfish. but then look at me, I am so busy being angry, I haven't had a chance to be sad yet. what if I don't get sad?  Is that bad?  Am I a bad person?  I only saw him once every couple of years, if that. I didn't really know him,  and when I did see him he was very generous, but also a real jerk. his intensions were always really good, but he always was very bosy and rude. I remember once when I was like 8 we went out to eat, and he yelled at the waitress because they didn't seat us fast enough. but, last year when he came to my graduation we went out to eat . oh had a thought. My sister and I were thinking about him the night before he died. thinking about how he is always so concerned with us, like for example, he always focused in on something important to us, like when I was a vegitarian he always sent we cook books and when I danced he always called me his little princess or his little ballerina. this continued for years, he never forgot. . when we went out to eat for my graduation he was so polite to the waiter, and even joked with him ",1
408,"I even went to summer school here in the Preview Program and I still find myself in amazement sometimes. I am adjusting well-- a great deal better than my mom. That could be because college is something I knew I had to do and the University of Texas at Austin has always been the place I wanted to be. My classes are okay. I have a sort of messed up schedule. I really cannot complain. Tuesdays are the only days that totally messes with my mind. I cannot seem to get signed up for a research experiment in Mezos. I have went by a numerous amount of times. I like to get things done ahead of time. I am just now doing this because the lab is always full. I am too lazy to go to the one at my apartment complex and when I came to the lab yesterday I totally messed up on the waiting list procedure. When it asked for your name, I put in my name instead of my if account. so I couldn't log in and it assigned my computer to someone else. When I used the lab over the summer I never had to get on a waiting list, so I did not know. I did get quite embarrassed though. I did it right today. But I guess I did not anticipate doing so, I did not bring a disk. As far as I can tell though I don't need one to complete this assignment. so let's see, school is doing fine. I am having roommate trouble a little bit. I live off-campus and I have 3 roommates. Well, 3 of us get along fine. But one attends ACC and she is 17 years old (boy, does she act it). Well, that is the only thing that is bothering me. I am stuck with her for a year. She lied to get in our apartment and now we are stuck with her. Oh well. In my Philosophy class, which I just left by the way, Professor martinich is so interesting. He wrote two of our textbooks. He' s real perceptive and insightful. I am taking Philosophy of Religion. There are about 150-200 people in the class, so we have SI Groups. I hate my SI. We are supposed to discuss and we actually get graded for it. But, I don't fell comfortable doing so. I love to talk and I have plenty of opinions, so that's bothering me. The only thing I can come up with is that when talking about a thing like religion everyone comes into the discussion with strong opinions. Like last week, we basically argued. I made a comment and they looked at me like,"" Boy is she stupid. ""  I don't  like that. Even the TA acts like he has his own views and those that are against the grain aren't worth listening to. He questions your comment and accepts others. I don't  know. I am thinking about talking to Dr. MArtinich. I guess I'll give it one more try. that was just the first one. I shouldn't get counted off for being in an uncomfortable environment. ",1
923,"I am presently thinking that I cannot believe that I am actually going to sit here and write fo 20 minutes, that is a really really long time. Well I am also thinking that I am fivxing to go to aerobics from 9:00 to 10:00 and not only is it late but it is also going suck. But I need to get into shape. I am worried that if I don't go and excersise I am going to gain that dreaded freshman 15 which will not at all be cool. I come fram a town of 20,000 and everyone knows everyone and all their business so I am sure that if I go home whith any added pounds everyone will notice, and most likely comment. Well I just looked at the clock and I realized that I have only been typing for four minutes, and this really scares me because I do not want to get cramps in my hands. I hate to type, because I am not very good at it and on top of that I do not use very good grammar or punctuation, even after I checked and rechecked my work. So it does worry me that I will have to turn this assignment in unrevised. I cannot get itout of my head how weird I think this assignment is MY friend is now leaning over my shoulder trying to read the assignment and she is making me very nervous. i can not stand to be nervous. The girl next to me just call the little whistle on her screen which notifies her of new mail, and I was thinking that I love it when I hear that noise. Earlier before I started this assignment I checked my e-mail and I had one new message from my friend Travis who goes to Sam Houston State, I was so excited to hear from him he is one of my really good friends. the lady that is in charge of the computer station just made this girl show her, her id and when she asked for it she was not very nice. Which makes me think of the fact that I very strongly dislike people who are rude when they are providing a serviece to you. I mean it is like they are getting paid to do this so I do not know why a little common courtesy is so hard to come by, I am getting really bored with this assignment because I am having a hard time concentrating on typing while at the same time letting things naturally flow into my thoughts. But I guess that you are used to that, I am like also wondering why I am acting like you are actually going to read this because I know that you are not and it seems stupid to sit here and just jabber about nothing, someone else just got the e-mail alarm and once again I am reminded of my most recent message, which I was very excited about, my friend next to me is the one I go to aerobics with and she is already all dressed in her aerobics outfit ready to go. she just interrupted me again to ask me for the instructions on how to get here, I do not like to be bothered when I am in the middle of doing somthing, but I have found that it is very not to be bothered when you are living in a small space with someone, because no matter how quiet they are trying to be they never seem to be quiet enough, I know glanced at the clock again and I realize that at max I only have to type for 3 more minutes which excites me very much. My fingers are cramping and I am getting very old with this assignment I am hoping that the next assignment will not be timed but I am under the impression that with my luck that is am improbability, I feel sorry for my friend she just started the assignment and she has no idea what she has gotten herself into, I cannot wait until she is done so I can ask her what she thought about. WEll MY TIME IS UP!!! ",1
695,"Today I have only one thing on my mind. Her name is mary. I met her at this party a while back and we kinda hit it off. I never reallly saw her or talked to her, but the other day I saw her and it was on. I am really worried about tonight. I have a date with her tonight. I hope I don't screw it up. I hope that she likes me as much as I like her. I hope that I don't screw things up. Well whatever happens happens. This is weird I havent really thought about a gitl this much since Christine, I think that I still think about her sometimes. I don't know why I always do, I just do. I thik it might be because I liked her so much. It is funny because I never slept with her. It doesn't matter that much though, I am a fucking liar. I need to stop lying. I don't do it to be mean or anything I just tell little lies and they get big. I need to be honest with everyone. I am who I am I can't please everyone. I think that one of these days I am really going to get myself into some major trouble. wow I can't type as accurately as I would like to type I want to be able to type with no errors but I think that will be immpossible. I feel really guilty about missing class. I have missed to many classes already I know I am better that that I think I will see how long I have been writing now. sometimes I feel really dumb and unattractive. I am going to hook up with Marry I like her a lot dammit and for gods sake I am going to hook it up. I mean that I want her to be around for awhile I am not going to be scarred of this one. ever since about my sophmore yeah in high school I have been really scared of relationships, but I am not going to be any more. I know that sometimes I will get hurt, but that is just the game that we play. If I want to win I got to play the game. I do want to win. I will win, if I keep playing I have to remind myself sometimes that the game goes on. it doesn't stop because you are having a bad day. Well lU think that I have really kinda lert my mind go off. I am kinda hungry and a ciggerete would also be nice. I can't eat though cause I just ate and that would be dumb. I have been smoking less and now I only smoke lights I think that it is a good thing that I am only smoking lights. a pack of reds would be really good. But I have to smoke lights for a while. I must remeber to only smoke when it is cool. I can't smoke too much tonightbecause I don't want to send the wrong message. I think that my typing is getting a little better. Well maybe it isn't I don't know I wonder if anyone will ever read this. I doubt it If they did really read this they would probbably think that it was complete shit. Maybe not. Who knows I wonder why nobody ever emails me. Well I get stupid forwards but they are really dumb must of the time I wonder what the fuck is really going on in the world these days I want to drink a beer or two or three. I want to get laid. I want love, sex and euphoria. I want it all and I want it to be given to me. I don't want to work, I want to float through life. I want things to be easy I want to pursue my hobbies. I want to get paid for listening to records or maybe making them if someone else wants to listen. I think that music has to be hyping yourself. nobody puts out a record to listen to it themselves. they try to make money. well it looks like my time is just about up. Bye ",0
1551,"     Well here i am writing this assignment don't know exactly what to make of it but i will give it a try. College has definetly been a weird expierience so far frat life is very different than what i was used to back in my home town. My friends are acting very differently even friends i knew close in high school are pretending like the don't know me and its strange. don't get me wrong i have nothing against branching out and meeting new people but i still like to keep in touch with my friends but i can't seem to do that. Huge decisions permeate my life right now, i mean people keep telling me that the decisions i make over the next couple of years are going to affect me but it seems like the decisions i make right now affect me the most. Whether i join a christian fraternity or not its all so strange. People are often so complex and strange. I guess thats why i am a Psychology major. The mind is so complex and even today hasnt been mastered. For example how do i know if what i am typing here right now is my actual real thoughts and not something i think abuot thinking merely for this expieriement.  What is real. . if it is just electrical impluses interpreted by the brain then what is real   - Morpheus. Just thought i would throw that in there. don't get me wrong i know in my heart the foundation of my life but already in the first chapter of this book i have beef with this writer. He explains coincidences in our lives as totally unrelated and people use extra ordinary beliefs in superstition or God to explain them. I don't believe that at all how is mr Myers so sure he knows what a coincidence is anyways? Too me it seems there are too many coincidences in modern day life that they lose their   coincidentibility   and some greater power has to be in control. I willingly get up every day knowing without a doubt that The Creator of the Universe has sacrificed himself for me and i can't tell you how great a feeling taht is. Knowing that no matter what mistakes i make during the day His blood will cover me. Evolution is a big tub of crap. How can something come from nothing. . its impossible defies the system of physics? Even if one buys into the Big Bang Theory which is a load of crap where did that first star come from? SOMETHING CANNOT COME FROM NOTHING. . and the way that things are spiralling downward the farther and farther we push God out of the picture. The more we take Him out of the Pledge of Allegienace and our money the further we dig ourselves until He comes back like a   theif in night   and to be honest i can't wait.  For the wisdom of man is the foolishness of GOD   so the smartest man on our is a fool compared to Gods infinite wisdom. I guess Jesus just encompasses my life which is why I must place Him in this paper. I know Psychology is where God wants me but I watch guard to be sure taht human s don't think they know everything heck even Freud had some akward ideas about sexual behavior in children people are human God is not that is simple. This 20 minutes is actually very long how can i sit and write this long. WHy am  i listening to 311 right now i mean i got the song yesterday but i didnt think i liked them but i guess they make some good music. These shorts from Foleys are the bomb  they only cost 5 dollars. . they are plaid. Joshua keeps talkin to me and interupting me and hes whacked up. . he is the most judgemental person i have ever met he thinks he can predict the future and it really makes me mad. Hes so certain and hes so wrong and it blows. I did laundry today and it didnt take long but i didnt take anythign with me so it just seemed like forever  You know what is the worst thing ever when girls come to your apartment and steal your dvd's without asking taht is about the worst thing ever. I am kind neat like that and i like to account for all my DVDs and when they are taken without me knowing i like freak out. I wonder how many college guys look at pornography. . i bet its allot. i wonder if girls look at porno probably not but ya never know. Why would yo go to A&M i mean its a terrible school. Welp time is running out so i guess this is winding down but i hope i gave some insight and hope everything turns out well ",0
1876," I am feeling very tired at the beginning of this strange assignment. What a long weekend, and day it has been. Rainy days always seem so long and dreary. It has just recently stopped raining but I wish that it hadn't. In my opinion, days spent studying are much better when it is dark and gloomy out than sunny and shiny. I actually love the rain and really enjoy rainy days. I would really prefer for the rainy days to also be cold but that does not happen very much this time of year. One thing that I have been thinking a lot about recently is this new season that is rapidly approaching. I love the fall more tham anytime of year, especially the month of October. What a fabulous month it is. October is long sleeve and jacket weather, football games, State Fair of Texas, and the time when the leaves change. It is always so pleasant and so comforting. I do not know why or when my obsession with October started but it did, and it has been a part of my life for quite some time. This will be my first October away from home though so my expectations could very likely NOT be met. That would be a dissapointment but it would also serve as a reminder to me to not expect anything. I really wish that I would never expect anything from anybody because I am always setting myself up for a dissapointment when I do that. People that do not have really high expectations from others or situations must really benefit from life because everything that happens to them is better than they though it would be. That is actually probably not always true but, its a thought. I tend to have too high expectations from people. I have a big imagination so I will usually get worked up about something before it ever happens, and spend time imaging what it might be like. When I do that, I always find myself dissapointed when things do not turn out the way that they are supposed to. I am about to be distracted from my stream of conciouseness because my roomate and friends keep talking loudly in the hall and I can hear them. It is late at night so I did not take my medicine to help me focus so I hope this does not become too much of a problem. It is very hard for me to concentrate when I can hear one distinct conversation in the background. It is a strange thing, but I could write a paper in the middle of a crowd if it is just useless, background noise, nothing clear, just a lot of muddled voices. If I hear a conversation though, a really clear conversation among a group of people, it becomes near impossible for me to focus. Why is that?  I really do not know. I hate that I am so easily distracted. It is a joke sometimes to even attempt to have a conversation with me about one topic unless I have taken my medicine. I have had ADD for a long time so I do not mind telling people that it does not come natural for me to stay in one, focused conversation for extended periods of time. It is really very sad at times actually because I feel like I am hurting feelings when I do not give a person my full attention, but I don't mean to be. I just have trouble staying on one topic because almost every topic easily flows into a new topic. What a mess I get myself into. I really do amaze myself at times. People probably think that I am very rude but I am not, I just can't stay focused. Right now I am getting a sore in my mouth and it is really bothering me. I think  that it has formed because of the amount of sugar that I have consumed in the last two days. Someone gave me an enormous sack full of candy as a gift and I have consumed about 1/2 of it in the last 48 hours. That is not something that I normally do. I do not feel good about eating candy, or anything unhealthy most of the time. I am actually proud of myself for indulging though. Everybody needs to treat themselves every once in a while. I have a sweet tooth also so I have to satiate it from time to time. I just hope that I never turn into a glutton. How does one become a glutton?

I wonder what CD I should listen to next. I should try to call Janet again. I really want her to come visit me up her. I know how much she likes Austin. I'm really glad that I didn't buy those tickets for the Chemical Brothers since now I have a math test that night. I wonder when the concert starts. I really do want to go. And the concert is the day after my birthday, it would be a present to myself. Plus, I've been waiting 2 years for them to play in Texas. I really like this song. This room is rather boring. We definitely need to get some more stuff on the walls. I have to make a list of stuff to pick up when I go home, otherwise I will forget everything and I don't know when I'll be going home again. I think I'll listen to Semisonic next. I haven't listened to that CD in awhile. I'm glad I decided to bring the CD with me. Today is Deidre's birthday, and Allison's. I should send Allison a card. I wonder if Kisha got the one I sent her. I need to get a prepaid calling card so I can talk to her. She needs to come visit me too. I should probably email her again. This bed is so hard, it's making my back hurt. But I have to admit, it's not quite as hard as the one I had during orientation. You would think the mattress would give some after having so many people sleeping on it. I miss my bed at home. It's so comfy. Wow there are a lot of people walking by all of a sudden. I think that this is one of the coolest assignments I've gotten in a long time, it's much better than all the busy work I had to do last year. My mom will be happy to know that I like my psychology class. I won't be talking about music all the time, I'll actually have something related to my major to tell her. Well I think that's been my 20 minutes of truly intelligent thinking. ",0
1885,"My name Is Keely and I am a Freshman here at UT. Moving away from home has been a difficult task. I have really been lonely here. I have noticed that it is getting easier though. I do have two brothers that live here in Austin. My oldiest brother also attends UT. He is in his second year of law. My other brother Josh doesn't go to school, but hopefully he will decide to one day. Classes have also been getting more difficult. I have been really stressed out because of all the reading. I am really nervous about some of the upcoming tests. Hopefully I will have prepared myself for them. I have a boyfriend named Jacoby. It was really hard to leave back at home. I miss him very much. This coming weekend is our year anniversary. I really want to go home to see him, but I don't think I'm going to be able to. It is very difficult to be here in Austin without all of my friends. When I'm bored there really isn't anyone to hang out with. My brothers are working a lot so they don't have much time to hang out. My  parents were sad to see me leave for college, my mother expecially. I am the baby of the family. My mother is extremely emotional. She often cries and gets depressed now that all of us are gone. She also calls us a lot more and e-mails me all the time. I feel sorry for her!  The only person she hangs out with is my dad. My dad isn't too bad, he just is set in his ways. He sits in his recliner and watches nascar all the time. My poor mother has to sit there and watch it with him. That really doesn't sound too fun to me. Anyway, I know that I will eventually get used to it here, but it will take some time. I just try to keep myself busy so that I don't have time to think about how homesick I am. At least I have my brothers here. I couldn't imagine being here all alone. I would drive myself crazy!  My roomate is really cool. I got really lucky with that. We have soo much in common. She has the same since of humor as I do. Also, we have all the same classes together, which is really helpful. Now it doesn't seem like I'm alone all the time. I have her there going through the same thing. Another thing is that the bus stop by my dorm takes me straight to my brother's aptartment. This makes it very convinient. I can get off campus and try to get away from it all. Well, I seemed to have come to a block. I can't think of anything to say. I'm trying to keep typing though. Oh, I really am enjoying psy. class. It is really interesting!  I know it is only going to get better too. Psychology is my major (at least for now) so this is my type of thing.           ",1
2197,"It's kind of weird writing about what I am thinking of right now this moment. there is not clear direction what I want to write about. I hope my english is good enough to make a sense to my TAs. well, I am really hungry right now. Maybe I should ask Bora to go to Chipolet with me and have dinner. I just love that place. I think it is the best fast restaurant in America. Well I did remember seeing the news column with Chipolet is voted as the best Fast Restaurant. "" I think it was the Austin local newspaper, because I can not remember the name of the newspaper. By the way I really should start reading the newspaper more. well I wonder if Doctor Griffen is gay or not. He really is funny guy, but today's outfit really was more like cloths that gay people would wear. I really think that he need a exercise. He can loose weight around his stomach. Well I really shouldn't criticizes him with the weight because I know that I really really really and seriously need to loose a lot of weight. I should start swimming again. And bring my old swimming suit from home. I can not believe that I forgot to bring it to school. I really want to go home. I wonder why mom told me not to come home this weekend. I know that I need to find the ride and everything. but This sunday is her birthday and coming up monday is unni's birthday too. I wonder ""Don't come home honey. It's too much trouble to you. "" means like "" Oh yeah come home!"" kind of deal. sometimes I don't really understand her. I hope I would not be like that. well this time thing is really going to slower then I thought. I should have ate first. Man I have only dome 13 min. umm now 14min. ha ha. yeah just 6 more minutes. well let's see. I should be worried about the psy class too. Man the class is too long to stay a wake. and chapters are too long. I feel like I'm reading the whole new different language. but It is fun. I wonder how tough his test is. man I really do need to catch on the reading. (I really will go read after chipolet if you are reading this. ^_~)         Let's see what else am I thinking right now. I really can not think of it any more. Ahhh man this pop-up ads. why can they just leave me a lone. I mean really nobody reads the whole think. man that must be the John. Boyfriend of my roommate. they are just cute couple. ",0

I am just so depressed at the moment because of everything that has been going on right now. geez what to type. I hate katie. she is an evil person and I wish that I had never met her. I am just so tired and exhausted. I don't' want to go do anything. I don't' want to go do anything. my head hurts. wow this is harder than I thought it would be. I keep messing up on my typing and it really sucks. I don't know what Professor Pennebaker wants me to say exactly. how do u spell hmmm. ? I just sighed a big sign of frustration and now I want it gone. I miss my best friends so much it's not even funny. I really wish I was home right now and they were with me so I didn't have to deal with this right now. what do I say next. I know I wanted to say something but I can't remember what it was. haha this is too funny to me for some reason. typing what I'm thinking in my head is funny, but it actually makes my head hurt. I guess that's because I'm typing in the dark. go me. I wish this was over. I wish this was over. I wish this was over. I want to go home. I want to go home. I really don't know what I want right now, but I know I am sick and tired of feeling like crap. I have a sore throat, and I have no idea why, but it really hurts. And I , and I , come on come on come on. what was I about to say? um. oh right I used to be such a happy person and I was until I moved out of my room and now feel like this big outsider that no one wants to associate with. It is really killing me inside. I feel like crying everyday and I have no idea what to do. I was such a happy person in dallas. seriously! nowadays I just sit in this room alone. I know I wish I had a roommate so I could talk to somebody! I really don't like not being able to communicate with the people on my old floor 15. I mean now I feel like I'm betrayed and so much of an outsider that I don't' want to do anything or be anything at the moment. I haven't felt like this since high school where all my friends went to the other school, and I wasn't the pretty enough girl to talk to. Katie sucks so much you have no idea. She is the biggest bitch I have ever met. I wish I never met her. no I just have nothing nice to say about her. it kills me because I don't' want to be the person who hates people because I used to judge people so much back home that gosh I don't' know I don't want to be that way here. I really want to be liked and have fun and just be who I want to be but I can't do that now with this thing thing THING just hanging over my head like a bad mother f**king migraine. I am not typing that. I guess I just did. I don't know what they'll think of my cussing but that is so how I feel right now. I've talked to counselors and people and more people and more people and my mom and my mom and my mom gosh my mom and mom and mom and mom and mom I could keep going on this if you would like but I don't think you would because I would just type mom for like 20 minutes if I could. I don't know why I just said 20 minutes I think that's funny because that' how long I have to do this. gosh kill me now. I'm just so tired mom mom mom mom mom mom  MOM MOM MOM MOM I really hate my mom right now for making those freaking phone calls. all she ever does is not listen or listen too hard. there is a hair in my nose. how do you spell aew no oww like the pain feeling? I don't know. I really don't' care I just want to finish this so I can go scream and cry and jump out that freaking window. I don't even know why I'm saying this stuff because I'm not suicidal I'm just pissed off and don't have any other way to stop my feelings. I don't' know how to stop my feelings. I don't' like typing and thinking at the same time  tickle tickle tickle because then I have to say everything twice so I can type it out because I can't type very fast. I have bad grammar, and my mom would hate that right now especially if this is for a class which it is so I guess she would hate this. my arm is tired from writing so fast. my head my head my head my head my head my head I can't find the h key so I almost typed yeatd. hahaha my leg hurts too and my back and my head and my neck. my leg really hurts. it's tingling now.

2211,"This must be the easiest and hardest writing assignment ever. There is nothing easier in a writing assignment when context and grammar doesn't matter, but there's nothing harder when one has nothing to write about. OK, how am I feeling? Hmm. I have a light headache and my contacts are bothering me. Right when I wrote ""light"" headache, it started to hurt even more.        Anyways, in class Pennebaker did this statistical project or what not between people who are afraid of death are more likely to support Bush. Then, people who are more terrified of terrorists are more likely to support Bush. Hmm. I on the other hand, am not terrified of terrorist because I support Bush and feel safe with his leadership. That's how I would see it. If you are not afraid of terrorism, then you must think that Bush is doing a fantastic job with keeping America safe.        Oh man, it's only been five minutes and my wrists are already starting to hurt. hmm, maybe I'll just type slower.         My eyes are bothering me. Man this really sucks that I can't use the tab button to indent. I don't really want to keep pressing the space button because I am lazy and my wrist hurts. Ok forget any form of organization. I'll just babble about nothing. My eyes are watery. I bet it's due to my stupid contacts. My nose is runny too. Hehehe snot is gross. I wonder when anyone will ever read this. Never. Completion grade. Yay! Ok what am I thinking. I am thinking that I need to think of something so I can type whatever that thing is that I think ok. This is hurting my brain. I bet this is great for my headache. Wow, nine minutes already. This looks pretty lengthy. Ok I am positive that no one will ever read this. I mean who is going to read 300 plus random thoughts. Wow I just felt pressure to make mine interesting and jestful. What if mine is the most boring writing essay. No way, I bet that there's way more boring-er people than I am. I am just so cool like that. hehe no not really. Ok ::sigh:: 11 minutes. Wow. Time just slowed down. Ok I'm out of things to think once again. I rather be sleeping. It's in the afternoon and I just had lunch. I want to take a nap. Like pigs, they take a nap after they eat. I'm a pig. Only one minute has passed. What is this assignment suppose to prove. That class is composed of 300 hamsters in an experiment. Don't get me wrong. I don't mind. I'm in a fishbowl. Who's not a fishbowl? I am getting very sleepy. hehe I just thought of those guys who use a watch to hypnotize someone till they fall asleep and they say ""you are getting very sleepy"" in this creepy tone. well I feel like one of those guys being hypnotized. yayayaya! only 5 minutes to go! wow this is the best writing assignment ever. this should count for %50 of our grade. it's only fair. ok ok ok what am I thinking? I am thinking that I should be thinking of something to think of. ha that was gay. I'm hungry already and I just ate rice and steak. man I am a pig. I just have a big stomach capacity, I can't help it. headache. snot. itchy eyes. 3 minutes to go. I would be so mad if this whole thing got erased. hmm I wonder what everyone else is writing about. oh no, what if theirs is more articuling and witty. oh well I don't care. I hate competition. ha-ha ut's the best place for that. oh my gosh the count down begins. we have seconds left ladies and gentlemen. After much ado this fun is coming to an end. I must say it has been lots of fun. ",1
1525,"     The green leaves outside are a very vibrant color of green today. I really hope it doesn't rain again today because I got really wet yesterday. That ticking closk is really annoying me. I never really notice it until I I have to go to work though. Theres my sisters Harry Potter book. I wonder if the next movie that comes out will be any good. I really hope it is. I have no idea why my Dad is so into trains right now, hes been collecting them everywhere. I think this is his midlife crisis hobby. We had to drive four hours this summer to go to a little dinky town called Rusk just to ride a steam train. It wasn't really worth it. I wanted the train to go under a tunnel or something but it never did. That French toast i made this morning really wasn't very good. I left a funny taste in my mouth. I should probably go brush my teeth, they have syrup all over them. I am so tired I shouldn't have stayed up as late as i did last night. Putting my thoughts on paper is really hard. I have no idea what to write.  My arm hurts. I think its because i haven't streched it since volleyball season last year. I hope the team does well this year. I'm pretty confident they will. They have some really good players this year. i wonder how good of a player Mr. Pace's daughter really is. she made varsiity this year as a freshmen but then again thats really not too hard to do, considering. The new coach seems to be aa good coach though. I really hope she's able to build up a strong team. I wish that I could play for one more year. volleyball is so much fun. I wonder if i could get a team together to play intramural volleyball. That would be a whole lot of fun. Dawn alread y said she didn't want to do it. She is so unmotivated sometimes. I think we need one of those wrist pads for our computer. My hand is getting tired. Its probably just because I haven't typed hardly anything for the entire summer. I really want to take a typing class somewhere so I would learn how to type a lot faster. That would make papers a lot easier to write.   ",1
707,"Hello. My name is Neha Shah, and I'm a freshman this year. So far I love ut and I'm not at all scared of anything here yet. classes are great, and I actually enjoy most of my professors. they keep the class interesting. the only thing I really fear is that I will slack off. I am great at doing my work, and I know that I will get the job done, but when it comes to reading assigned chapters, I have a history of not doing it. that's my greatest fear. most people fear they won't find friends, or will get homesick, but amazingly enough, I'm not homesick at all. I'm actually doing very well here. I met many people at orientation this summer and it turns out that I've come close to two of the people that I met. one of which I am with usually everyday. and friends from home also keep me strong. high school was great and my senior year was so memorable to me. I finally gained the confidence in myself and I gained so much to my self esteem. On a normal, day to day basis, I try to keep an optimistic approach to everything as it comes to me in obstacles. this way of thinking has allowed me to get through hard times, whenever I'm feeling down. My friends and  family have also contributed to that. they are so close to me. my younger brother is someone I love and despise at the same time. he's probably the only person on earth that knows how to make me so angry without saying more than a couple of words. he's a genius. he just doesn't seem to know it. he loves to be different, which isn't exactly the best way to do things. (especially when it comes to my parents). he's not bad at all, just likes to argue his point, even though he knows he's wrong. he's always there to help me out when I have a problem, and I know that. He's very strong too. he never shows what he's really feeling. for example, when I left to college, he acted as if it were no big deal. well, in the last week, I've recieved about 4 or more emails from him. he does care, just doens't know how to show it. my parents are also so great. I'm somewhat conservative and that is due to their parenting. the way they raised me is the best gift they could've given to me. they did an awesome job. I am so proud of being indian, and I'm also very proud to be part of the family that I'm in. I wouldn't change that at all. I grew up in a city that really isn't that small, but to me and my friends. I like growing up there, but I really wanted to get out of there to move on. in a way I'm still home because of the people that surround me and email also lets me talk to everyone I need to, but austin itself is a lively town and something I really wanted. I wanted to move to a big school, where you could meet a diverse crowd, and start over. I had a startover point my freshman year in high school, and now once again in college. I love it. I like to meet new people, because there's so much you can talk about. also, I love the effect of something unknown. in this case, austin is a new adventure to me. when I went to new york city a couple of years ago, all I wanted to do was walk around times square and the surrounding area just to experience the rush and energy. even though danger may come of it, I like to live life like that. doing things I by myself is also something that has been in me all my life. I've always been independent and I'm fairly sure that's becuase I take after my dad (who moved to the us and started a family here), and because I'm the older child. I like doing things on my own, so then I know if I make a mistake, I can fix it. I don't like depending on others all the time, but I love being with people. I know those are two contradicting statements but I do have those that I rely on, and I do consider connections when I need to. it's my word for people you know to get things you need done. overall, I love my life. I can't ask for a better one. the ups and downs just add to it, and I want to live it to the fulliest. coming here was a good decision on my part and I hope to succeed with great pride. ",1
1776, atlast i m here writing this assinments which i was suppose 2 do long back. . i m wondering why am i such a late person doing everything at the last moment. i m just wondering why??i have become such a lazy bum don't feel like doing anything. i have become so boring. and why am i even thikin so much about it. right now i m more concerned about tmorrow. how is it going to be. who am i going to meet. am i going to meet new friends now thta i m in UT. sometimes i feel so intimated becuase its so big that sometimes ur just not noticed anywhere. what can i possibly do so that i make a differnce n people notice me and i make new friends. now that i m so alone. i really want to meet new poeple and make friends to hangout with. these days have been so bad for me. broke up with someone and i just got into UT and i harldy know anyone. i feel so alone sometimes. wondering am i really going to meet good people. sometimes i feel is everything going wrong with me only or what??i have not been studying lately just passing my time doing nothing. while i m writing all this how i wished i could talk to someone right now about what i feel. Its been a year now in this country and i still feel homesick. I still miss my friends back there. I really don't know what i should write. I m wondering what is this writing thing all about??what should i say i desperately want to meet people. Sometimes i feel so lonely in that big world. May be its just temporary feeling because i m just new to this place. Everything should be fine. I m just thinking about what i should be doing tommorow. Infact more worried about what i should be wearing to college. One another hectic day get up early in the morning. Oh god why this torture of geting up early in the morning. I really like that guy i met a few days back. Wish we become friends. I really find him interesting. I hope the bookstore has got the books i wanted. I have been going there for long time but they still don't ahve the book. Where can i possibly find some work its is really boring sitting at home doing nothing. And why is that again i keep thinking about the guy i broke up with. Well we didnt break up technically but its not workin either. Wish i could just make a decision about us. Why is it getting so hard without talkin to him since the last few days. We are just not communicating well. What has really happened to our relationship. I wonder what he must be thinking about me. Why do i feel even the most handsome guy on earth wouldnt be of any interest to me now that i miss him so much. why the hell anythign went wrong. Anyways forget about it. Just snap out of it. Lets see what happens. I don't want to take it seriously. It would work if it has to. Well thats the spirit. wish i could just relax and think     ,0
1860,"     Well. I just finished my first week of college. I can't believe I'm already here, but I wish I was already out. There seems like so much to do but I'm starting to get things under control. I think. My friend Helen is at A&M and shes going to jump for the track team. She is an emblem of success. everytime I think of her, it reminds me of just how bad of a person I am. I guess everyone makes mistakes, but my mistakes seem to be a lot worse when I make them, because I know better. Hopefully  I can keep up with all my reading assignments. reading is definitely not my thing. especially when I'm forced to do it. Tomorrow's reading time will be flled with the SI class, but that's okay I think I'm going to need as much help as I can get. Tonite's church. thank the Lord. Sometimes you just got to get filled up when everything seems so dry. I love church, but sometimes I feel so . . I don't know. not as good as everyone else. like nobody makes mistakes but me. I know that's not true. only I lie from the devil trying to get me down. anyways today in psychology class someone mentioned obessive cumplusive disorders. and I wanted to scream out. I've been caught in that trap beofre. Which I have and thank the Lord I no longer am bound by that chain. only by the grace of God did I get through some of the worst, tearful, confusing years of my life. Oh. El Patio sounds real good right now. not only because of the delicious food, but because I have to right a paper on it and I need to get some intricate details to make my paper a success! I can't wait to be home tonite. I've been up at school since before 7 am. only to realize that my 8 am class had been canceled. my next class was not until 12 noon. Oh well at least I got some studying in and I was able to finish my english homework so that I wouldn't have any tonite. Praise the Lord. Anyways back tonite. my boyfriend is suppose to call me about ten. man I hope he gets his own phone soon. I miss him. I wish could just get married right now. but my father might have other plans for that situation. . but I don't understand sometimes. why do you always have to wait 'til your outa school before you get married. . of course I understand the logical part of it all, but what about love. although love is suppose to be patient. I don't like preaching to myself all the time. it's like I know what's right but I wish things could be different. I don't know. right now my biggest concern is my dad letting me drive down to San Antonio and pick up Stephen (my boyfriend) on friday afteroon. oh Lord please help me to find favor with him on this situation. Wow. twenty minutes is a lot longer than I thought it was going to be. It's like writing in my journal on the computer. what Dr. Pennebaker said today about when your depressed, to write what your feeling down. I totally agree. I know no matter what I'm feeling it always helps to write in my journal and shed a few tears of course! I like journals soo much that lately, I've been giving them to my friends for their birthdays. my time is clicking down. I really hope I can find a job soon and hopefully my friend Lauren found one today. ",1
1090,"I hate driving in Austin. There is never any parking and there are scratches on cars everywhere. People are so impolite when it comes to cars. Jay just kept running in to this car just because he didn't care about his own, someone hit my brand new car. And now I have no paint there, if my parents find out they are going kill me. My mom didn't want me to take it with me. I hope the body shop does a good job. That is my main concern. I had a headache this morning. I think from thinking too much and from drinking last night at the frat house. My roommate was being nice to me this morning. Jerry told me she talks about me and that we both know we annoy each other. my dad said we wouldn't get a long from the beginning. And boys are so much trouble. Why does Sak always have to do this to me? I think I will finally answer his question truthfully now. I thought I had been, but he was right, I'm still hiding something. I don't understand what he means when he keeps asking me what I want. And then he says not to want anything. Why must he always try to be the good guy? I don't know if he is telling me the truth. If he says he could have fallen for me then why does he tell me not to want anything? This boy is driving me nuts. I don't understand why he keeps doing this. Deep down, I think I know the answer. But I guess I hide from things a lot. People always say I hide myself. Sak says I hide myself in questions. I do. I never answer personal questions. I answer them with questions. I don't know why. Maybe I do need a psychiatrist. I think too much. I think I scare Sak. Because he just got out of a long relationship and he fell in love with the girl and she broke his heart. I don't like her. She doesn't like me either. I've never spoken to her face to face but she does not exactly give you those warm fuzzy vibes. She looks at me funny. I think she's stringing him along. That's why he does this to me. But then he told me I was wrong. He said he doesn't want the past and that he can't. I think it scares him to let himself go. For some reason I think he's the person who can help me figure myself out. He saw through me hiding behind questions. But I think it's because I don't doubt him. I trust his opinions and his thoughts. That's something I don't do with most people. I trust him. Which surprised me. It usually takes me a long time to get close to someone. Maybe because I am always hiding. For some reason I think he has the key to unlock whatever it is I am hiding. And I think he knows exactly how to open what ever it is that I can't open myself. That's what I want, I guess. I want to tell him the truth but I can't. Because like him. I am hiding. We're both hiding. Only he does a better job at it. Probably because he is a guy. Why do I trust him? I don't understand that. But sometimes I think he says things just so he is not the bad guy. Why do I trust him so much? I think because sometimes he reminds me of myself. I remember when I first met him; I was not attracted to him. He looked cunning to me. Like he had the wits to take advantage of people because he was so smart. But then I think he also has the heart not to. That's why I think I started to like him. He has a good heart. And I think that's one quality that is hard to find. Oh my gosh! I guess this answers his question of what I think about him. I think I will give him a copy of this one day? I will tell him the truth. The entire truth of what I thought when I first met him until now. But I also want him to tell me too. Because I don't want to be the only one who opens up. But I don't think that will ever happen. I think my twenty minutes is about to be up. And I have such a bad memory; I don't remember anyone's name. I feel so bad. Why can't I remember? That's unfair to me because people know who I am but I have no idea who they are. I need to work on my memory. ",0
100,"Here I am sitting in the computer lab trying to track my thoughts. I am thinking that I shouldn't worry about what to think. I am not exactly sure why this assignment is necessary, but then again I am no psychologist. Whoa, change in thought. Now I am thinking of England and of how I wish I could go there to see the sights and see a close friend who lives there. Now I am sad because this reminds me of Princess Diana and of what a wonderful woman she was. I was truly saddened when I heard she died. She was on of those people that you dream of meeting some day even if you are only around her for  a moment. She was the type of person that could make your whole year just by smiling at you. This sadness takes me to other places, I am now simultaneously thinking of a close friend of mine who is clinically depressed and of old friend of the family who was homosexual and died this year of AIDS. I am a Christian and I have strong Christian beliefs but when tragedy strikes those you love the most there is wonder and doubt involving a supposed loving God. Sometimes I praise God for the things he does but other times you ask yourself why. I have always been a dreamer, setting my goals high, but sometimes I wonder if what I want to do with my life is right or if God wanted me to go off and become a minister. Life is never simple but I just try to roll with the punches. A minister of mine once said that some people build up barriers around themselves in order not to get hurt. They try to experience the least amount of pain as possible by blocking themselves out, but then he said that these same people cannot experience love very much. At the same time as protecting themselves from pain they are limiting themselves to a lesser degree of love then is possible. I want to be one of the people who can experience love greatly, but in reality I have been hurt before and there are definite walls to protect myself from that kind of pain again. Whenever you go on a date and you are nervous everyone says just be yourself. I think that is a huge crock of shit. I am a multi faceted person, I don't even know what being myself would be. Is that the self that you express outwardly, where in my case I am jovial and make people laugh or is that the self inside that has deep emotions and is very, very sensitive and sometimes insecure while also being loving and caring. Sometimes I feel like I have all of this love stored up inside of me and no one to give it to. I try not to dwell in these places for any significant amount of time. I think IO like who I am, but its just that I really haven't figured that out completely yet. At first I didn't know what to write, but now I am glad we did this assignment. It is good to get your feelings out from inside when you don't want to tell anyone and you don't have a diary. Bye-bye. ",0
1225,"The cell phone just rang. It was my roommate's phone so I didn't pick it up. I had a great weekend. All I can think about is my exboyfriend. How stupid am I to be writing about something like my exboyfriend. He makes me feel so weak. He is my Achilles heal. He makes me feel like no other can. He manipulates me like no other. In a good way. He is all I can think about sometimes. I'm listening to Dave Matthews. I am wondering by the time I am done with this assignment whether or not I will selfdiagnose myself with ADD because I know I will jump from one thought to another. I will stop at 3:33PM. Right now it is 3:17. I ate breadsticks today with my good friend Ngozi. We have been friends for 7 years. Tomorrow I get to see Jets to Brazil at Emo's. I am extremely excited. Sometimes I draw blanks on what to type. Interesting. The blinking of the computer is bugging me. I am listening to Dave Matthews right now. He can be a little too jazzy for me. I am not a big fan of the saxophone. I don't like Kenny G. Even though he doesn't play the sax. I just called my best friend at OSU. She hates it there. The thing is, writing for a good twenty minutes is hard. I got all my thoughts out just a minute ago because I wrote in my journal. I have my own website where I have journal entries and pictures and various other interesting things. After this I will do the pretesting. I hear it is pretty long. That's never fun. I hate the food at Andrews. It tastes like a bunch of nothing. I also feel like keeling over after I eat the food, too. I am not using Microsoft Word for this. This is straight typing into the submit form. You think in a room of 540 kids there would be some boy to catch my eye. guess what? Not one. I still love my exboyfriend. Why do I jump back to him? I went to a frat party last Friday. It was fun, but I don't think I could date a frat guy. They are not really my type. I wish I could get over my exboyfriend. But would that be a good thing or bad? Who says I need to get over him? He was my first, possibly my last. I think he has very strong feelings about me too. I wonder though. Boys can be very ambiguous at times. Why can't we all be blunt? My Kirby Lane experience has been forever tainted. My food was cold and I saw a girl toss her cookies in the parking lot. People can be so irresponsible sometimes. They need to know their limit, or just take care of their business in the privacy of their own place not in front of Kirby Lane. My hands are crampy from all this typing. This is an interesting project. Anyway, I am going home this weekend. Back to Grand Prairie. I miss my niece. Her name is Ashley Rene Johnson. She is adorable. She just turned two and I wonder if she remembers me. I hope she is talking more. She is beginning to worry me. she barely talks. A homeless man hit on me today! In front of Bevo's! I was startled, but was I guess flattered. He had sunglasses on, so maybe he saw a distorted version of me. He called me beautiful. Hardly. It is getting cold. I am anxious to reread this writing assignment. It is 3:33. Thank you. ",1
1672,"It's late and the fan is on it keeps spratically blowing on my arm. My arm is getting kind of cold. I have been reading for about an hour now and my eyes are kind of lazy. I have some catching up to do on my homework and i need to go get a book tomorrow, the one i got online was the wrong one. today was a long day, i'm glad it's over. three classes and a long work-out session. i like it though, the working out, it make me feel. . . good. i like to feel good. tomorrow is going to be an easy day. ony one class. my nails look bad i sure need a manicure. the fan is really relaxing with the blowing and the hum sound it makes. there is no other noise, usually there is a radio playing but not tonight, homework was the important thing. i want to do several things this week, attend some meetings for soccer and for this business fraternity that i want to be in. i think it will be fun to be involved with the school. i sure wish i could find some information on the football or baseball spirit groups. thats really what i want to do. i love watching ut play no matter what sport. i was athletic in high school i wish i would have listened to my dad when he said   you should practice, you could get a scholarship   i could have, the demand for girl golfers is pretty high. i didn't listen oh well can't cry over spilt milk. i miss my parents, i know they miss me. my mom calls alot but im glad she calls me because i would fell kind of foolish is i always called home. you know, everytime i visit i get teary eyed. i know that sounds stupid but its getting better though. i love this school though, the only school i ever wanted to go to. been a fan forever. everyone else in my family is an aggie. i will be the first longhorn in family history. pretty cool i think. i wish i could do more with my room. its too small and my closet. man i have no words for that. but i like it here, its close to school and everything else for that matter. the walking across campus kind of sucks but thats ok because its ut campus, that makes all the difference in the world. i can't believe i got into the business school. i still remember finding out like it was yesterday. i was completely speachless. literaly i had to go outside, it was one of the most liberating and self gratifying moments of my life. i am smiling right now. i have alot of pictures of my friends in my room, i miss them too. mainly my best friend kristi, she is getting married in november and i hate that i am not there to help her out with all the wedding stuff, she calls and i always do what i can while i am at home but its not the same. we were neighbors you know. for the better part of out childhood. i am usually not this depressing sounding. i guess its the long day and all the prior homework setting the mood. my arms are starting to hurt because i am typing with my comp on a stool by my bed, sitting on the edge. its a strange position but i havent yet got me a desk. . like i said the room is small and well my comp desk was big. well good night.

942,"I am very stressed out right now for several different reasons. For starters, I was half way done typing this paper when my computer messed up and everything was erased. Also, I have fake nails which makes it very difficult to type. At this moment, I am trying to write this psychology paper yet all I can think about is everything else I have to do. I wish I had a pen and lots of post it notes with me at all times because I am always thinking of things that need to be done, yet I can never seem to remember them. I am constantly bombarded with thoughts of what books I need to go buy, what sections I need to read for what class, and how I am going to pass this semester living in Castilian. It is wild and very loud which makes it very difficult to study. Also, my ex-boyfriend Derek is in the hospital. He has Multiple Sclerosis and it happens to be very bad right now. I feel so guilty because I have not had the chance to visit him since he has been admitted into the hospital. I think that my mom and I are going to send him some flowers, though. We broke up almost two months ago and he has had a difficult time excepting that fact. It makes me sad to know that he is in the hospital doing absoultely nothing while I am away at college having the time of my life. I don't want him to think I don't care about him anymore or that I have forgotten about him, but this is my own way of really moving on. Last night we had our first date dash for my sorority. I invited this guy named Jordan who lives at Castilian. He is really good looking and we had a lot of fun together last night. Usually I am intimidated by good looking guys, but for some reason I find him very easy to talk to. We also had fun dancing together which is a definate plus because I often feel self-conscious when dancing with good-looking guys. I am a little upset becuse he left me after we got back to Castilian. He told me that he was going to go talk to his friends for a few minutes and that he would be right up. Too bad he came up an hour later when we had already left. I am not even that mad though because I know he feels very bad about it. I am hoping that he invites me to Delt pledge line. I am also very excited because this guy I met and dated at camp this summer wrote me an e-mail! It may sound pathetic but I was really glad to get it. He is a lot older than I am so I was expecting him to forget about me after camp. We are planning on getting married in four years as long as ""college doesn't change me. "" He is a TA at OU and is one of the most interesting guys I have ever met. We share a lot of the same beliefs and have such a good time together. When I graduate from college we are going to move to a beach in Mexico together. We just sarcastically talk about that, but I wouldn't mind it being a reality!! The other night I put some closure on an event that I had needed to for years. It felt really good to do that. And now I am going to put closure on this paper because all I can think about is what I need to do and how I need to be back up at school soon so I can start getting ready for the game. ",0
170,"I returned to Austin Monday night at about 12:30 a. m. thinking I would be able to simply crawl into bed. Wrong. Upon opening the door to my room I was mugged by an extremely intoxicated friend. Her name was Sally and the source of her angst was my best friend Sean. They, as I am, are both from Houston. They had broken up their one-year relationship two weeks before they were to leave for UT. Unfortunately, they both reside in the private dormitory The Castilian. Unfortunately only because there is an exorbadent amount of tension between them, and I being friends  with both of them, am forced into an awkward situation. Sally declares she is ""so totally over Sean"" and is willing to forgive, forget, and become friends. Simultaneously, she has been extra nice to me, extra offense to Sean, and picked up a nasty habit - getting totally plastered every night she has been in Austin. She has a lot of frustration with Sean, and regardless of what she thinks, needs to find more positive ways of venting it. Sean's feelings toward Sally are fickle and skeptical. Sean addresses some  interesting questions Sally is unable to answer. Such as, why all of a sudden do you want to  be ""friends"", what do expect from our friendship, and why did you suddenly latch onto Bryan as a friend. Sally's motives remain unclear and yet she doesn't seem to want to  discuss any of the many issues at large. In turn, this makes the situation of the three of us living within 20 seconds of each other an awkward one. Am I to take a side? Most definitely not!!! I refuse! Yet how can I befriend both Sally and Sean without functioning as a mediator. This is one of the many issues that trouble me and make the transition from High School to Huge UT College life challenging. Thank you. ",1
907,"I have a lot of stuff to do tonight. I'm glad I'm getting this done relatively early. I wont have to worry about it when it comes time to turn it in. I usually don't get assignments done thiis quick but I have a lot of stuff to talk about soi thought I'd go ahead and do it. I found out about bonnie having breast cancer today and that just adds to the fact that meme has cancer as well. that's two people in one week that I'm close to that have found out that they have cancer. I haven't known many people in my life wit hcancer and all of the sudden this happens. I really wish they didn't have to go through kemo therapy. it seems so primitive and I hope a more efficient and effective cure is found soon. I talked to rachel tonight. I know we will probably never have anything but the situation with her mom may bring us all very close. I love them like my own family and I know that me and mom are ready to fly out there anytime we're needed. five minutes have gone by and I'm already tired of typing. I'm excited about seeing ashley this weekend. I miss her. I'm really looking forward to meeting all of seth's friends. he says they're all hot so this ought  to be a good weekend. I'm glad everything has worked out with seth and my parents. I feel a lot more happy when I talk to rachel. she still has that effect on me even after the rough time we had this summer. I still think she is one of the finest girls I have ever met. I just got a new email but I can't check it for another ten minutes and that is going to drive me crazy. I have to clean my truck out tomorrow. after starr dumped that frapuccino all over the place, it has stunk in there. this is a really good song. I like listening to heartbeats on the beat. somethimes they depress me though. I wish I could send one out to someone special. I'm sure she's out there; I just have to be patient and not try to force anything to happen. I have a really good life. it would be much better with a girl but I can do without untill the right one comes along. I'm so excited about going to vail for new year's. we're going to have so much fun. I'm glad kim is going. she is so cool and my best friend in the world. kelly is such a good cook. so is mom. those were both very random. I'm not sure where I want move next year. I pretty much have any option open since brannon lives in some of the most expensive appartments in the city. I only have five minutes left. this is a cool assignment. I like to just sit down and write my feelings for a while sometimes. it helps t osoothe my nerves. I really wish I could check my mail. I have a lot of readiign to do. I love this stuff we're talking about in psycology. I'm not just trying to suck up or anything because I figure dr. penn wont even read this. it is all just really intriguing to me and I am haveing so much fun. I hope meme and bonnie are both alright. I want to see the ellenburgs again. I hope they come out and see us soon. I want to see rachel again, too. and reagan. ",1
596,"I feel nervous inside and butterflies keep flying around my chest. This is probably because I am nervous about what my boyfriend has to tell me. I feel excited as well and it's pretty weird, but for the first time, in a long time, I know what it means to take advantage of ones individual strength. I mean I feel as though things will work out, but what if he tells me that the one and a half years we've spent together are over. Anyway, this has pretty much been on my mind since 7:00a. M. I can't really think of anything else but that. Gosh, I am so nervous, but then again I'm probably over reacting. Other things has also been on my mind like my first test in biology. I really don't know what kind of questions are going to be asked. I'm sorry, but I just feel so nervous and I think these butterflies have turned into bats or something because I can't even breathe without feeling more nervous by the minute. I feel pretty confident and I guess that's good. I guess I'll stop thinking about that for awhile and let my heart catch up to my chest pounding. On to another thing I was thinking about. I can't believe that Magwire guy from the Cardinals almost beat the record foe the most homeruns. Pretty weird that I jumped from one serious subject to another, huh?  That's pretty much the way I work inside. I get all worked up about something and then the next minute I'm laughing and having a good time. I know why that happens. I don't look at the bad things in life, I only look at the good things. It's bad for me to say, but I could probably walk down a dark street with no common sense and think that that street is the most safest place on the face of this earth. A lot of people judge a lot of things from the outside which is so unfair to everyone. Not everything that looks ugly or dirty is bad. In fact, the prettiest looking and the wealthiest looking people probably do more crime or illegal things what the ""middle or lower"" class would do. That's why I hate when I get my pay check and see how much taxes I pay for people to just claim welfare for something stupid. More than half of the on welfare are able to work, they're just too lazy!  I know this for a fact because my boyfriend's step-sister does that. So, basically, while I'm working my ass off for people like her, my money is lost and I don't even get that much taken out of my check for MY Medicare. That's what's so unfair!! Well my 20minutes have flown by so, I will write to you soon for assignment #2. good-bye and take care. ",1
1654,"     I really like music, i think its really cool to just get on the computer and be able to listen to any song, at anytime. it really bothers me when you turn on the radio and they are all on a commercial at the same time. It's very aggrivating, but this world is run by money so I guess there is not much we can do about it. When i listen to music, I like to day dream and imgaine that there is a story to every song, which usually there is, but I parallel the stories to my life and see how they impact me. I also just like to fantasize about certain things that a song might talk about that are a little far fetched. Music helps me go to sleep also. I can never really fall asleep to it, but I will catch myself doozing off and then wake up and turn off the songs. Speaking of sleeping, why is it that you never really remember the good dreams but the nightmares and the ones that are just really weird. I've also thought its really weird that you ususally forget your dreams if you don't write them down as soon as you have them. Why is that? Usually my nightmares involve harm coming to my family but no matter how bad they get, I also manage to either transport or take my family to safety just in time. I still wake up in a cold sweat but just the fact that I know they are ok, makes me feel better. Even if I keep going back to the same part of the dream I try my best to get them out of danger. I have a very strong family background. When I was in high school my friends used to make fun of me saying i had the perfect  family and that nothing could ever go wrong. I always thought it was weird that even though i had a strong family background most of my friends didn't. Their parents were either divorced or had really bad problems. One of my friends got kicked out of her house, well she left actually but she had gotten in a really bad fight with her mother and her mom had called her a slut. I don't think I could handle my mother calling me a name like that. I think I have a very good relationship with my mother but I know that I don't tell her everything that goes on in my life. I've noticed that I have most of my secrets spread out through a bunch of people, like no one person knows all of my secrets. I guess that is because I'm afraid to trust one person so much, but I don't think that is a bad thing. I just think that I'm afraid that if one person knows me totally they will turn on me and tell everyone my personal business. I guess that is because in junior high I had a group of friends that turned on me and I don't think I ever forgave them. I went my own way in high school but to this day I still think of their betrayel and I can still feel the pain from it. Even though I haven't always had the best friends in the world, if I have a falling out with a friend I usually will make up with them later on in life. We might not be friends again but the air will be cleared and we can be civil to each other. That also works for my ex-boyfriends, it seems like after about a year we will begin to talk again and everything is ok. I've always been able to make friends with guys better than I have with girls, I really do not think I'm that much of a tomboy but I just think they are easier to get along with and cause less drama. My first year in college was the first time I think I made more girl friends but that also might be because I'm in nursing and there is a serious shortage of men in that field. I don't mind girls I just think they have more issues than guys. I also think it's really weird that I haven't found that one single person yet either. Everyone says that in college is when you find your husband and - or wife, but I think I'll just let it happen when it happens. Like even if I like one guy, there is almost always another one. I think I like like four guys right now and its terrible. One has a girlfriend, but is going to dump her in a little bit, apparently she is being a bitch. He doesn't know I like him but his friends do, it's crazy. I think I've been boy crazy all my life, seriously. If a hot guy walks by I just turn to mush. I think the ideal guy would be about my height, not too tall or short, with dark hair and either green or blue eyes. He would have to be tan of course and have the best sense of humor either. He would also have to be a talker, I'm really into having good conversations. Don't get me wrong there is always time for silence or just having fun but every relationship I've been in has failed because of some communication issue and I think I've just learned that as long as you keep the communication channels open things will be good. I think I am a good communicator fo. r the most part, I know I'm a good peace maker and keeper, coming from a family where I had two sisters and one brother I guess its no surprize. I've noticed that people like to tell me about their problems also. I can just be sitting somewhere and someone will start talking to me and telling me their life story and I think it's just because they want someone to listen and that's exactly what I do. Not everyone wants advice, sometimes they just want to be heard. I've noticed that people in the hospital like to talk to anyone who walks in the door. I work at childrens and parents will also be eager and willing to talk to me. ",1
259,"today I called up some of my friends from Harlingen (where IÃ¯Â¿Â½m from) and we all went out to the drag. it was sooooo nice to be able to kill time, since it has been going by so slowly. I am so tired from walking all day. at least I found my exploring psychology book at bevos. I want to get fake nails put on tomorrow. my mom said that I could buy whatever I wanted, but I feel bad spending the money. oh well, at least IÃ¯Â¿Â½m not doing anything illegal. I am so excited about rushing for that Christian sorority. I really want to make some lifelong friends here. not just some people who only care about themselves and what they're going to wear tomorrow. I wonder if it's true that a huge majority of psychology majors become shoe salesmen. great. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m here getting homesick for nothing. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m surprised that there are so many people talking outloud here at this computer lab. I thought I would be the loudest one here by simply opening my backpack. I wonder if it matters that IÃ¯Â¿Â½m not using capital letters when I type. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m sure it will be fine. I am so thirsty. since I've been here I have already finished off 18 bottles of water. at least it's helping to keep my skin clear (knock on wood). psychology is so interesting. I wonder what my stream of consciousness says about me. who knows, IÃ¯Â¿Â½m probably sending off signals meaning that IÃ¯Â¿Â½m going to be a psychotic weirdo when I get older. I like my necklace, but I feel like I am wearing a dog collar. it looks so tight on me; I have a huge neck to begin with. they say that the first sign of aging on a woman is when her neck wrinkles. well my neck has quite a few. I really like this computer. my keyboard is so annoying. this one has keys that write so smoothly. I hope I've been studying enough. I really need to get over the idea that college is extremely hard and requires absurd amounts of studying. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m doing just fine!  IÃ¯Â¿Â½m really surprised that I have so much to say. I thought I would be sitting here trying to impress whoever's going to read this by using really big words and coming up with impressive thoughts. I guess I was really wrong. I forgot my glasses in my dorm. I hope IÃ¯Â¿Â½m not damaging my eyes by not wearing them. these girls sitting beside me are really getting loud. it's really getting annoying. all of a sudden they quieted down. I guess IÃ¯Â¿Â½m sending off bad signals to them. I really feel like brushing my teeth. for some reason I've been brushing them an average of five times a day. it's probably some type of stress release or something. I wonder how my friend Jody is doing back home. she just left to Harlingen this morning. I wish I could have gone home with her but I really need to duke it out here. I can do it!!  what am I going to do tonight?  probably study or something. I hope my roommate decides to stay in our room for once. I guess I like my space though. my mind just went blank right now and I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t have anything to say. I really admire the older people who come to college. I wish my mom would. she deserves it. I hope I am that devoted to my child. I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t see how someone could give up so much for someone. I know I would do it for her, but just the fact that she has done so much for me already is amazing. I wonder if animals go to heaven when they die. I really think they do. it wouldnÃ¯Â¿Â½t be fair to me if they didnÃ¯Â¿Â½t. I wonder how Danny is doing back home. I hope he is having a fun time. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m so lucky to be here. I wish I could give back to someone else. maybe that volunteer organization will call me and ask if I want to help out. I definitely would jump at the chance. I need to go to the rec center and pick up an aerobics membership. I hope IÃ¯Â¿Â½m not gaining weight here, but I guess I will find out when Jody brings my scale back up with her. I better not be gaining weight, because I spent an enormous amount of money on a personal trainer. what a waste!  I hate it when people ask me what type of music I listen to. I really donÃ¯Â¿Â½t know what to say because I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t listen to very much music. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m so glad IÃ¯Â¿Â½m getting this assignment over with now so that I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t have to rush to do it at the last minute. I need to go back to Mezes to sign up for some of those experiments. I hope there are some slots I can fill up. IÃ¯Â¿Â½ll bet that so many people are going to end up writing a research paper just because they'll put of going to sign up for the experiments or because they donÃ¯Â¿Â½t show up to participate. what a waste!  maybe I shouldn't talk, because I can just see that happening to me now. I wish I was good at math. that would be the ultimate!  I've been typing for twenty minutes now, so I think IÃ¯Â¿Â½ll sign off. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m surprisingly sleepy!  you all probably wont read this until a few months from now, but I just want to say thanks for such a wonderfully convenient assignment :) I hope IÃ¯Â¿Â½m not too weird :)))) ",1
509,"It was very frustrating to get on to the web site. However, the weekends are fun. I get to see my friends that are not at this school. This weekend I went home to see one of my friends who signed with the Kansas City Royals. I also got to see two of my best friends that are guys. One goes to TCU and the other goes to Tomball Community college. He was supposed to go to Georgia to swim, but two days before school started, he called, and they told him that his spot on the team was gone. Now he is writing other colleges and the Yale coach called him. If he does not swim, he will probably come here next semester. I also got to see my boyfriend. He goes to Baylor. He was my best friend first and now we are together. It is great. However, I miss him a lot. He is the sweetest guy I know. Anyway, right now I am borrowing a friends computer because mine doesn't work. It is really a pain. I need to go tomorrow to the computer to have them install my Ethernet card. It is not compatible with my laptop. I am right now in the school of business. However, I am really interested in psychology, and am thinking of changing my major. My dad thinks this is a terrible idea. My mom thinks I should do what will make me happy. I guess I need to get as much information as I can about the type of jobs that I can get with a psychology degree and the amount of school I will have to complete. I will also need to see what schools have good psychology departments. I really do not want to go here next year. I want to go somewhere smaller with less freaks. I will probably stay in the state. I will probably go to A&M of Baylor. Oh well, I guess I have a while to decide. ",0
2434,"     I really do not feel homesick at the moment. Today a lot of my sorority sisters were feeling so sad because they miss their families and everything at home. In a way I do feel like I miss my mom and my dogs and Dallas in general but I am having too much fun in Austin. More and more parties and events filled my calender as the week progressed and eventually I just got sick. Literally. I felt like I was spinning in bright lights and feeling more and more nauseated by the second. As soon as I started feeling that way, I realized the true comfort of home that I do miss a lot. Today I ended up waiting at the health center for two hours by myself and I really wanted my mom to be sitting there. I felt really independent which I liked, but I also felt lost. I had no support and I feel like it will be hard to not feel so sick with out my mom.        On another note, I am getting scared about this whole freshman fifteen thing. I am eating cereal at the moment and it is ten o'clock at night. It seems crazy to me. Hopefully all of the walking to class will clear off the extra pounds. I feel so terrible right now. I am so thirsty and my mouth is super dry. The doctor told me that my lymph nodes are swollen which scared me because they feel like they are going ot explode. My room mate will not stop humming and it annoys me as I write this. And all of her online music is driving me up the wall. It is getting so hard to concentrate on this paper. I am about to start getting ready for bed also because I am super tired. I really don't want to go to my 8 30 class in the morning. Do you know how early that is?  I am not looking forward to it. I hope the class is fun. It is about fashion design which interests me but I heard it is really hard and has a lot of projects. I finally got water. I am so excited. I really like the way my room is decorated. It is all pink and orange accessories and it is super cute. Ow. It really hurts to drink this water because of my nodes. Ouch. The doctor told me to inform her in case of that but I had not had a problem really. My forehead itches. I feel like I am complaining a lot as I am nonstop writing but I guess it has just been a really rough day. I really love UT though, I am having such a great time. It makes me laugh that you will probably not be reading this until I am on my deathbed. That will be funny. I bet this writing is really bad but I am just following the rules. This constant humming is really annoying me now. I have already told her to stop once but she keeps on humming. Oh well, I can not let it annoy me because we are best friends and room mates and all. This is going ot be an  awesome year. I can not wait till the time gets rolling. I really feel like brushing my teeth. I can still taste my Frosted Flakes. Gross. I have to remember to take all of my medicines for the night. I always forget little but important things like that. I also felt like putting on a facial mask to help my skin out. My skin seems to be really sensitive to weather and location changes. It kind of weird like that. Well my time is almost up. I feel like even though I am thinking about things, I can not really decifer what I am hearing inside my head. It is kind of weird. My room mate is staring at me trying to make me laugh, but the good student I am, I am trying to resist laughing. Well, I am about to go to sleep and my time is almost up so good night. ",1
450,"I really think the professor is funny and can hold the class' attention.    I am listening to a Dave Matthew's CD. I was never really a big fan of his until recently. My roommate and best friend ( she is also taking this class) loves Dave Matthews. She asked me to go to his concert with her months in advance. I had heard a few of his songs, and even though I wasn't crazy about them, I agreed to go. It was two weeks before the concert and a really good friend of ours was moving to Houston to go to graduate school. Dave M. was going to be in Houston on Friday and Austin on Saturday. So Robyn ( my roommate) decided to sell her tickets and we would help Justin move and see the concert in Houston. On our way to Houston the U-Haul had a blow out and a few other tragadies occured, forcing us to miss the concert. Robyn was devastaed. So Saturday we headed back to Austin and bought tickets to go. After several beers we were there. Somehow I got seperated from my friends. When we found each other I cried, I think it was from the alchol. Anyways, we happened to be at the right place at the right time and a guy came up to us and brought us armbands to go to the front of the stage. I pushed my was to the very front and managed to convince a bodygaurd to give me a backstage pass. At the end of the show they took me backstage, gave me flowers and then showed me to Dave. I was the only one that wasn't freaking out backstage, so he came up to me. We talked and he signed my ticket (the only thing I had on me). He left but came uback up to me five min later. I was talking to somebody and I saw soomeone come up besaide me. Then I felt a hand on my breast (the right one). It was Dave, signing my chest. I thought I would faint. His voice is so sexy. Later right before he left, he came up to me and kissed me. I love him and will marry him one day.    Sorry I wasted ten min blabbing about the same story. I guess the point of the entry to to see how many ways my brain goes. I just thought of something else. I have a crush on a waiter that I work with. I'm a hostess. I haven't had a crucsh like this in a long time. I'm so mad because he didn't work today or yesterday and he won't work until Friday. I don't even know anything about him. That's probably why I like him. The last guy I dated was gay. He won't admit it but I know he is. We're not seeing each other anymore. I usually don't talk about guys this much, but for some reason they are on the brain tonight. I just set up my email account today. I'm soo excited. My parents have been bugging me to get one. I'm using a friends computer right now, but we will have the internet set up by Friday.  I really hope no one reads this horrible shit. I know it doesn't make any sense and no one cares about any of it. I have to go read 19 chapters for English now. Aren't you jealous??!!  ",0
2173,"It was a really humid day today while I was walking around on campus, but now since I'm at home looking out my window, I see so many people coming home from campus, getting off the bus with water bottles. I realized that Texas weather is crazy. At one point it's humid and then the next it is super hot. It's nice and clear now. I'm sure its not that hot because it's going to be 6 pretty soon and it cools down around this time. Earlier today I thought it was going to rain. I really don't like walking around in the rain. My first day of class at UT it rained and I didn't know where I was going I was really miserable. Before you get home you get soaking wet and then the AC units are on all around campus so your freeze through your classes. Sometimes I wonder how the students at UT feel away from home. I know that my first semester here I was extremely homesick. I hated living away from home even though I was only 30 minutes away. I lived in an apt my first year and I regret the fact that I didn't live in a dorm because I would have gotten to meet so many more people that way. But then again I liked living in an apartment because I had my own space. I didn't have to share a bathroom with anyone and it sure wasn't a crowded community with only two people in 1200 square feet area. My freshman year I didn't meet very many people, but my second year I was introduced to so many more people and I started enjoying college rather than just staying at home and reading or doing homework and watching tv. There's been a big change from then and now. I actually like to stay in austin instead of going home on the weekends because I always have something to do. At home I get bored very easily. Of course I still miss my parents but its so different here with all my friends. All kinds of crazy actions go on. College life it super busy. This semester I feel is going to fly by. Before I know it I will be on Thanksgiving break then studying for finals and then home again in two weeks after that. Sometimes I feel like I need to be more active in school programs and associations. I never have time though. Something is always coming up. I have a load of homework or a test coming up that stops me from attending these functions, or most of the time I am just way too tired to do anything. For example, right now I wish I was lying in my bed taking a nap because I'll probably have to hit the books as soon as I'm done with this writing assignment. I never knew twenty minutes would take this long. Twenty minutes is a very long time. As you can probably tell I am getting very restless. I have very short patience. I like to take care of my business and get going on to the next. Time can be very crucial sometimes. When I'm late to class I wish I had more time to take are of all my stuff before I have to head out but other time when I have too much time on my hands I wish I had some chores to do or homework, despise the fact that homework can be a killer sometimes. I don't like the way this apartment is never the right temperature. It is always too cold or always too hot. It is never the right temperature. I think its because all of the rooms in this apartment are at different angles so they get cold and hot and different rates so my roommates and I always change the temperature on the thermostat according to how we each want it. Oh well I guess that's the way it works. I just looked at the timer and I have a minute or so left so now I'm thinking about time and going totally blank on my other thoughts. It's nice to randomly talk about different stuff. It's unusual but good writing assignment. Kinda funny that I sat here and typed away for a good twenty minutes, and I just got stopped so I guess that's it. ",0
179,"9/8/97 Yeah, I've finally gotten around to doing this assignment. I hope I do o. k. Oh whoops, I forgot to check my watch to see when I need to stop. O. k. it's 1:50 so I will stop at 2:10. I just double spaced at the end of that period. I remember learning how to do that in my 8th grade computer class. Oh gosh, what if this is too short?  I'm a really slow typer, but this is really fun. The girl next to me is typing so fast, maybe I will be that good by the end of this year. There is a boy now walking around with a blank expression on his face. I wonder where he is going. After this I am going to my room and working on some homework. I like how the keys on this computer feel when I type. I miss my computer at my house, but anyway. This is fun, because I'm so used to typing in an organized fashion where everything is structured. I mean this assignment is structured, but our writing doesn't have to be. My left eye itches, but I'm afraid you touch it because I don't want to waste any time on my assignment. My watch just beeped which means that it is now 2:00, and I have ten minutes left. Wow, a loud buzzer just went off, maybe someone messed up a computer or something. Someone just rattled his change which reminds me that I have only a little bit of money left for the week. I hope I'm writing enough. This is as fast as I can go. I wonder if you really read these or just skim through them. It said this was a completion grade, good. I'll work on the other assignment tomorrow afternoon. the line now for waiting has gotten really long. Thank goodness it is air-conditioned in here. My left eye still hurts and is making me blink. I wonder what the others in here are working on?  I wonder what my parents are doing right now?  They are probably both already at home. I hope they find a place to stay for parents weekend. Gosh, that sounds so freshman. I only have 5 more minutes left. There is no way the teacher reads all of these. The t. a. must help. I like Scott. I went to one of his study sessions. My nails are long and I wanted to get a manicure. I wonder how many in the class have finished this assignment?  Typing is very therapeutic, I feel a lot more relaxed now. I hope I've typed enough. The girl next to me is leaving. I have 2 minutes left. I just checked my watch. I'm kind of sleepy. I think I will go to bed early tonight. Yeah, tonight David Letterman is on. He's my favorite. Oh, my time is up. I'll be back tomorrow to work on the next homework!!! ",1
883,"At this exact moment I am wondering how long this twenty minutes is going to last because I am going to falll asleep  soon and I  have a lot of things to do. I wish I could be doing this on my own computer, but the stupid thing wont work, I  think I am computer illiterate. I have had e-mail sitting  there since june and I can't get into it. It is killing me that I'm not able  to talk with all of my friends that went away for college. I shouldn't have waited to do this assignment until now because I need  to finish getting my stuff together to go back to ny dorm room. I am really glad that I was able to get away from her for a day, I always have the worst luck and got an incompatible roommate, but I would rather not have come home. The food is better but my  parents are constantly bothering me. I need to check my messages in my room,I bet there are going to be at least ten, and half of them are going to be from Ben, my ex-boyfriend. Not going to waste my time on him anymore-- why do people cheat on each other, I woant  ever understand that. And what makes him think that just by sayng I Love You htat I am just going to forget everything. Forget hijm,  at  least I have met someone new that I can tlak to heis so sweet and all but I think I should call it off, nothing ever works for me  and I ned to concentrate more on my shcool work. I don't know what to do about guys. I need to meet some more girls to hang out  with, but the only ones I see are all snoby sorority girls  a nd that just isn't me at all. Kyle is such a sweet guy and all but should  I tell him htat I need to slow down and work on my shcool or should I just let things go and see what happens. I'm scared to just go with  the flow, I really like this guy a lot and the last time I felt this way I got hurt and  that pain is still here. Everytimt Ben calls I  get a happy feeling inside until I think of kyle and how he is here now and how Ben messed up when he screwed me over. My mom is yelling at me again I wonder what I did now. Icould be nothing but it will still be my fault for some reason  I swear that if I ever heard my  parents compliment me or say that they were proud of my I would probably have a heart attack right then and there. I wish I wasnt such  a dissapointment  I have never done anything right and if I don't get a 4. 0 gpa they are going to lay it on me because if my sister can do it,  and play volley-ball at ut then I should be able to just sit there and study constently and maybe one day live up to her. My feelings for  Ben and Kyle are so mumble-jumbled in my brain right now that it is starting to hurt from thinking about it all the time. Well what a  surprise my mom is coming to yell at me  as much as I am used to it the tears still come very easily. ",0
1037,"Alright, well right now I have no idea what to write. I don't know what my professor is expecting this to say and I do not know what all of the other students are writing about. I don't really want to get too personal just in case I get to be the lucky one who's homework is spotchecked. I am worrying that school is not being focused on as much as it should be. I sometimes think that I am going to be able to get by as easily as I did in high school when at the same time I know that that is not the case at all. I know that I am going to have to study so much more than I ever have and it freaks me out. Especially since I am not so sure that I know exactly how to study. I don't want to go into an exam thinking that I know all the information and then have no clue what the test is saying to me. I want to do so well this semester and in a way I have to if I want to transfer into the school of communications next semester. And the fact that I heard the other day that Professor Pennebaker is the hardest psychology teacher here did not help much. I didn't think he seemed that hard but apparently he is. And I also am freaking out about the whole sorority thing. I am having so much fun with it but it is taking up a lot of my time and so are all of the parties that go with it. I have to decide whether or not I want to go home on Saturday for the night. I want to see my parents and my friends but I don't know if it is worth it. And also I don't want to get really sad when I am there. I am worried that I am not going to really want to come back. That is not saying that I am not having such a fun time here but I think that me not wanting to come back after a night at home is a possibility. I am having so much fun here but it is a lot of stuff to deal with sometimes. And it is like I am never capable of being alone. And when I am alone, its when I don't really want to be alone. There are always things going on and people around when I just want to relax and sit down. But that is never possible. And there is so much to do all the time that studying is so hard to fit into my schedule. But I do have to admit that I am studying because I know I am more than some of my friends. Friends is another thing that kind of scares me. I hope that my best friends from home and I don't lose touch just because there are so many new faces here and everyone is wanting to meet new people. I just kind of wish that I knew who my group of friends is going to be so that I can start hanging out with them and making memories that are going to count. Okay, well I hope that this is what you expected from my 20 minutes of writing because I had no idea what else to write. Now maybe you can look at the way my brain works and help me deal with my problems. ",1
521,"it cuts into my social time and I hate that I can't do some things because I have to get ready for my classes the next day. I enjoy college that much. well I enjoy the social aspects and the fact that I can meet all kinds of new and interesting people, but I am so sick of school and the first week isn't even over yet. that is very sad. I wonder if everyone is this way. well at least I am trying to get a head start on all the psychology requirements. if I get them out of the way immediately then I don't have to worry about them at the end of the semester when I need to be worrying about my other finals. I am very grateful that we don't have a final in this psychology course. psychology is very interesting to me. I don't think I could pursue a career in it though. I just think it is neat to study what people are thinking and why they are thinking things. I think I can handle the class. think I can handle everything this semester. I just hope that I don't get too homesick and that I get along well with everyone. I can't wait to see Chris my childhood friend. he is so smart. he is fixing to start working on his phd in pharmacology. he hasn't always been this smart. when he got into high school his brain started to kick in gear I guess. ever since then he has made straight A's and has been the class genius. I guess what he needed was a boost of self confidence. his brother on the other hand needs confidence and motivation more than anyone I know. he irritates me sometimes because everyone has to go to him and he won't go do anything without people forcing him to go. I love him though. it is funny how someone can irritate you to death but because you've known him forever you have to accept his faults and still  love him. it is funny how people are so impressed with money and the people that have a lot of it. if you had a bunch of money you could have instant friends. it drives me crazy that people don't look at the person but what the person  has. you end up worse for it because that person that has all the money  just ends up annoying everyone else. anyway there are some people out there that aren't like that and don't go crazy over someone because they have a lot of money. that is one thing I have learned that you can't stereotype people at all because there are always exceptions to the rules. well my twenty minutes up and it went by real fast. it is funny how fast time goes by when your mind is preoccupied or you are having fun. I think it is neat. ",1
1642,"Wow. I reall don't like the color scheme of this page. It looks kind of gay. Oh well. hmmm, I better not diss the webpage, I might get a bad grade. I hope Mr. Pennebaker, doesnt read this one. hmmm. is that how you spell it?  p-e-n-n-e-b-a-k-e-r. sounds right to me. I wonder what kind of name that is. i mean like where its from. im not very good with names. i only have 4 classes and i still don't know all of my professors names. i like the way my dorm room looks. i decorated it yesterday. someone told me its important to get to know each of my professors on a personal level. that sounds good because thats what i want to do anyway. i usually enjoy classes better when i have a personal relationship with the teacher or lecturer. psychology sounds cool too. pretty much what i envisioned it as. like the topics we cover and stuff. im excited. oh man, i got a lot of work to do today. i need to get done with my computer science assignment. whens it due?  hmm, i think its next friday. but i want to get an early start so ill do that when im done with this. i hope rachel and i get back together. it ticks me off now that shes with that matt kid. hes such a dork too. oh well. its funny because i really am over her, its just sad because i know shes really the most perfect person for me I've ever found. its amazing how she admits that too, just isnt attracted to me in that way. oh well. i am over her, it just sucks sometimes because i get all ticked off when i think about the mistake she made. i hope tennis is on tv later, theres a rain delay right now. haha, blake almost beat hewitt. that was tight. too bad he didnt, i really wanted him to. man, only 6 minutes are up. yawn. hmm, i need to check out some more of the places to eat around here.

AHH, again. stop it. ok, less than 3 minutes left. what else what else. hunter is on the phone, hes been on all morning. i had to call nat a couple times. i hope his site works out. novotrix will probably die off though. TAC will be ok though i think. as long as he gets the snakes in he keeps saying he will. hmm, hunter is talkin to some girl. i can hear him on the phone. probably his girlfriend or whoever that girl is on all the pictures on his board by his bed. coach moore was a good coach. wow that was random. i should go visit the ridge for regionals this year, but i probably won't be able to. at least ill be there for state since im already here. ahh, times runing out. im trying to type faster, why am i doing that. i should ask on the message bored. jeez. that really is wierd. time is running out and i feel nervous or something and really rushed. everytime the second digits change i feel something in my stomach. ",1
1908,"so what do I think about for twenty minutes. I don't really know. it's different when you actually have to think about what you're thinking about. my feet are cold. which is so weird because my room is always hot! We really need to get that fan that we talked about. I wish I was home; I was always the right temperature at home. and if I wasn't I could just change it. oh well I'll be home at the end of this week. I hope steffie is feeling better and not having too hard of a time with classes. I haven't talked to nick since I've been gone; I wonder if he even misses me. probably not so much since he just started middle school and he is making all new friends. how come I haven't made all new friends? maybe I should have gone to a smaller college. I dunno, I just wish I wasn't here. seeing javi this weekend was great, but as much as I try to tell myself that I should be happy that I at least got to see him, I can't get rid of this hollow feeling. I think I've sighed in the past two and half weeks than I have in my entire life. but honestly, what will I tell mom and dad. I know that they support me but how am I going to say that after three weeks somewhere, I'm so unhappy and I just want to be somewhere else, preferably in oklahoma. I dunno, maybe I should just wait. it has only been three weeks, and you knew that you were a shy person. but eventually you'll start making friends like at home. I just wish I wasn't sad all the time. it makes me feel like I need to talk to dad about medicine again. I'm so sad. I hate it here. I just want to go back to normal. no matter what I do, like swimming the other day with jacob and alex. that was kinda cool, but I was still only mildly entertained. and as far as studying, I've always liked it, but now I depend on it way too much to keep me busy. oh yeah, I can't forget to go by the library today and ask for a job. if I don't get that done, it'll keep bothering me until I do. hopefully they'll have openings, because that would be the ideal place for me to work, I think. haha, everyone would laugh at me though. how perfect. Christine, working in a library. whatever, it sounds cool to me. my birthday. I wonder if we're going to have time to celebrate it this weekend. I hope Lee'or doesn't mind that I didn't call her. I should have called Dee dee back so that I could wish Lee'or good luck. oh well, she was getting married; I'm sure that she was so happy that she didn't even stop to think about it. I wonder what javi's doing right now. I    'm so glad he came this weekend. it was the best feeling. but then again, would it be worth it to change schools. I mean everyone is so pessimistic about this sort of stuff. should I even listen to them? I mean everyone said just break up before you leave. long distance doesn't work, but both javi and I ere so miserable. it caused more problems then staying together will. but I know what mom and dad would say. especially dad. he wants me to do well with business so badly. he is so proud. but I don't even want to do business! but then again, I dunno what exactly I want to do. except be with javi and start having some fun with this whole college"" experience that everyone raves about. so far, I'm a little disappointed. but I guess that's a little of my fault because all my motivation seems to have disappeared. except for good ol' school. at least I can judge that. I can't let them slip. my grades are what I can use to persuade my parents. that I at least tried the whole business thing, whatever. but now I'd rather do something interesting. ugh! business! yes, it's great. I got into UT business. wow! but if I can't even get excited about going to class, how am I going to get excited about getting up everyday of my life to do financial reports and stuff. oh blah! how boriiiinnngggg! how boring, how boring. but isn't that just perfect as well- I'm stuck between doing what I know is logically best and what I feel like doing. hmm, yeah, there are a lot of things on my mind. I always seemed a little stressed in high school. just trying to balance everything, but at least I had fun. I think if I were another person I probably wouldn't want to get to know me now either. despite the fact that I could get down before, I never doubted that overall, I was happy. now I just feel lonely. haha. maybe I should stop listening to coldplay. rush always said their music always makes someone sad. but I dunno, I really like the piano. and plus I have so many good memories from that one cd. I just need to listen to some more upbeat music I guess. maybe some  ",1
988,"Today has been a good day. At first I was afraid that UT was going to be a difficult experience for me since I had never been far away from home for more than one week, but it has turned out well. I've met a lot of people. Last night, I had a really good time. Even though I was out really late it was an enjoyable experience. I have tried to maintain friendships with people from my small town of Laredo. Although many of them weren't close friends they are still a contact to a world so different from the world that I used to live in. Nonetheless, I don't think I want to live in the past. I want to live life to the fullest. In fact, I decided a few days ago that the only way to adjust and have fun, I have to remember that I am a naturally outgoing person even though shyness sometimes overcomes me. Due to this, I have met more people. I do hope that the people I have met so far aren't psycho, though. You never know who you are talking to in a town this size or what that person must be thinking. Last night I had to ask some random person for a ride because the dorm dorms were locked and there was no one there to answer. Under any normal circumstances I would not have done such an irresponsible and dangerous acts but I was scared and I didn't want to spend the night in the lobby. As a result, I see that UT and Austin are turning me into a new person that I always wanted to be. Uninhibited. Fun. Wild. Although these characteristics have always been in me I realize now that they are barely rearing their heads for a a new beginning of adventure and excitement.  I don't miss home as much as I thought I would. I see that freedom and self-rule has begun to change my personality (hopefully for the better). However, I can't help but think that it may all be wrong. What if home is what kept me safe and secure. Being away from my boyfriend is the hardest. It has been two weeks since I last saw him and already doubts have sprung into my mind. I think of him and don't miss him the way I thought I would. I do in a way but not as badly as expected. A friend told me to keep her posted on my feelings and what I was thinking but I feel that talking about my lack of feelings would be almost as bad as being unfaithful to him. Nontheless, UT is proving to be a different and definitely exciting experience that I hope to enjoy for many more years. The future lies ahead and I await it with an anxiousness I have never known. I hope it all works out in the end. ",1
2076,"I am sitting here with my feet on my subwoofer. I should be reading psychology, my webcam isn't on right now. Jars of Clay is a good band. I don't really have much to write. Maybe I should go to the sophomore versus freshmen football game at Clark's Field right now, but I'm doing this instead. Justin Shih just IMed me. Justin told me to go play football because this assignment isn't due until the 12th and today is the 6th. I think I'm scared about falling behind in college. I've done all my calculus HW the day they came out. I never was this diligent in high school. I have nasty cough, it's been like this for a few weeks now. I hope it gets better. Two of my best friends are in Houston, I don't really have much to do without them here. I'm hungry, haven't eaten breakfast or lunch. God is bigger than the air I breathe, the world we'll leave. This is a song by Delirious?, a band from the UK. I slept in this dorm last night by myself the first time. I miss my parents and my brother. My brother is working in California, and for the first time I feel how much everything has changed. I miss my parents, they have done so much for me. I want to do well in college so that their money doesn't go to waste. I love you mom, dad. I feel a little sad that I can't see my parents whenever I want now. I can't eat dinner every night with them like I used to last year. My neck hurts. I wish I was playing warcraft III right now. I don't understand this assignment. Maybe further on in the course it'll make more sense but right now this makes none to me. These thoughts are not at all coherent. I hope I do okay on my economics quiz on monday. My poker book and chips still haven't arrived yet. I ordered them last week too. I wish people would send me care packages. My roommate just received a birthday present/care package from his girlfriend. I wish I had someone who would send me things. I've written a lot. I wonder if all the papers turned in are this long. This must suck for the TA to read. 400 students turning in non-sensical and incoherent papers. There's that cough again. I wish I could control it. My hands are tired from typing constantly. This assignment sure is long, 10 more minutes to go. I hope I get an A in psychology. if I beg for an A in this paper I wonder if it'll help. Just 9 more minutes to go. I can't think of anything else to write. Maybe this music is throwing off my concentration. Jars of Clay is now playing. they're a good band. Didn't I write about them earlier? Oh well. People don't call me, I wish someone calls me. I'm tired, I could use a nap although I woke up at 1:30 today. I wonder what Michael, one of my best friends, is doing. I should go to his room after this. Just 7 more minutes. I can't wait until this thing is over. Time sure goes by slowly when you're counting it down. I need to go to sleep early tonight, got to wake up early tomorrow. EV Free church is good. I need to check out Austin Chinese Church too though, to see how each compares to each other. I need to do my quiet time today, before I forget. Sometimes I feel like such an inadequate Christian, I have so many failures. I guess no one is perfect. I wonder what my brother's doing right now. It's 1 o'clock or so in California. I wonder if he likes it there. I wonder if I really like it in Austin. or if it's just an illusion. I think I like it here. I have friends, I think, things to do. I don't know. It's all so confusing. Sometimes I just want to hermit and not have social contact at all. I like to live in a big city such as New York because it's busy, but yet I don't' like loitering in big crowds or hanging around large groups of people. I wonder if that's weird, or maybe I just feel inadequate around large groups of people who I don't know. Like last night at CBS I didn't know a lot of people and I drifted from group to group loitering but did not feel like I belonged. Just 3 more minutes left to go in this assignment. It cannot go by any slower. I should go eat something after this. But then dinner is coming up soon. I hope I have time to get some more studying done this afternoon, or maybe tonight. I wonder if this is the longest paper turned in. probably not, there're some girls who can write nonstop. They probably double the length of what I wrote. I wonder if I am even doing this assignment correctly, I don't know how to track my thoughts or feelings, it's like I'm writing in a journal. Oh well. I can't be penalized for trying. just 30 more seconds to go. let's count it down    30    29    28    27    26    25    24    23    22    21    20    19    18    17    16    15    14    13    12    10    9    8    7    6    5    4    3    2    1    done ",1
1582,"I just finished working out. It was pretty tiring. I haven't worked out in awhile. It's kind of cold in the room right now. I'm always cold. I dont' really know why. It's kind of weird. I miss Freddy so much. Gosh, this webcam thing might not be so good. It's good that I can see and talk to him, but everytime I do see and talk to him, I just get sad. I want him here with me, but he's so far away. sigh. oh well. at least I'll see him at Thanksgiving. That will give me something to work forward to. Hmmm. My sister's husband is here for the weekend. It's still really weird. I can't imagine my sister married. It's quite strange. But she seems happy, so it's good. I feel bad that her friends are taking better care of her than I am though. Kind of makes me feel bad. But I'll babysit when the twins are due, so maybe that will make up for it. I'm going to work really hard this sememster. I have nothing else to do really. I can't go clubbing or to any parties or have one on one with any guy friends. With is kind of poopy. Because I actually get along better with guys. But it's ok, because he can't do anything either. I was going to write something and I just forgot what. I do that a lot. I'll like so upstairs or something and then I'll forget why I went upstairs. Yeah, it's pretty strange. Hmm. the tv is going on in the background. It's a pretty funny show. I need to go to the bathroom. I just drank a lot of water. But I still have like 15 minutes left on the clock. Wow. 20 minutes is a long time when you're just typiung random thoughts. I'm not homesick at all. I knew I probably wouldn't be. I've always been the independent type. Pipit is a pretty good roommmate. We dont' have the same friends or anything and we dont' hang out really, so I don't think we'll get sick of each other or annoyed with each other. She's out of the room a lot, so that's good too. I'm always on the webcam, so I guess its' good that she goes out or I think she'd be really annoyed. I havent' really met anyone new yet. I guess going ot UT does that to you. You stay in your comfort zone and it just takes too much effort to get out of it. Plus, it's weird. Even when I'm hanging out with friends or something, I'll start wanting to go back into my room to talk on the webcam. Man, I'm such a nerd. Haha, oh well. I think calculus will be my hardest class. I hate math. Ugh, at least I will have no more math after this class. woohooo. well, except that i'm doing accounting, which is a lot of math. But it's like simple math. So I'll be ok. At least no more integration in my entire life. goodness, that will be good to get rid of. Ahhh. . only halfway finished with the time. I tend to do that a lot too. I always look at the time. Even though i pretend not to. I still do out of the corner of my time. It's like I try to trick myself. But it's doesnt' really work so much. hehe. A lot of people are gone for the church retreat. I dunno. I kind of of wanted to go, because I didn't go last year, but I'm just not very comfortable with the church anymore. I feel like all they do is judge you. The pastor and the counselors and everybody just look down on you if you're not a servant leader or if you don't serve or if you don't talk to them and tell you all their problems. Yeah, I think it's pretty dumb. It's makes me really mad sometimes. They have no right to judge. My spiritual life is between me and God and no one else. uughh. Yeah, but I think I'm going ot find a new church when I go back from college. That will be good for me I think. Steven is iming my sister right now. I still feel kind of bad for him. They went out for like 3-4 years and then my sister marries someone else. But it's for the better. THey fought like everyday and he would always cry. SO that's not too healthy either. I miss my doggies too. Dusty Babulee Chen and even Mocha. Awww. my Dusty. I want him here to keep me company. I think Dusty is the only one who knows all my secrets. Because I know he won't tell anybody, considering he's a dog. He's so old already. It's going ot be so depressing when he passes away. That's going to be one sad day. I had a bad dream last night. Freddy dream-cheated on me. Man, that sucked. I was sooo mad when I woke up. I must be really insecure or something. THis is the second time I've dreamt that he's dream-cheated on me. Hahaha. That's pretty funny. It kind of sucks that my boyfriend and one of my really good guy friends hate each other. With a passion too. It's pretty bad. But Freddy has nothing to worry about, that's so gross. Rex is like a brother and I think of him as a girl too. I wonder if he knows?  He should. people always make fun of him about it. But maybe he just think we're kidding or something. Hmmm. maybe we should tell him. Dang, my hands are gettting really tired form typing. I don't think I exactly have the right technique. I wish I still played piano like before. I want to relearn the Chopin song. Maybe I will. . if I motivate myself to. That would be really good. That music class is pretty simple though. I hope these 3 months until Thanksgiving so really really fast. I cant' wait to see Freddy. Man, I think about him a lot. ",1
1909,"Well, Sitting here doing this assignment at 10:55 a. m. and my lazy butt just woke up. I can't believe that I wake up so late nowadays. I remember my freshman year where I slept a few hours a night and got by fine. I'm feeling a little bad about myself for not working out this morning like I wanted too. If I could just get up when I wanted to then there would be not problem. But no, I have to stay in bed until the last possible second before class. On Wed. I have my first class at noon, and I was late. How pathetic is that?  How can I not get up before the sun has reached its peak position over the city?  Typing this is making my forearm hurt a little. I first noticed that when I was shooting a basketball yesterday. I think I might have pulled something lifting weights the other day and at least worked something that I don't usually work out so it hurts a little. Is strange, I am supposed to be sitting here thinking of stuff and my mind blanks out, but when I am supposed to be concentrating, my mind decided that then is the appropriate time to start racing with ideas and contemplations not associated at all with what I am doing. I actually like this assignment, its kind of nice to just sight down and write down what I am thinking about. I tried to start a journal once but to no avail. I am not a person of habit. I cannot just dedicate myself to something at a certain time everyday or week whenever unless it is something that I have to do, such as class, or a job if I ever find one. I felt really disappointed that I could not find a job this summer. Why was I having such a hard time?  I have problems with things like that, I hate doing the first part of something, such as actually finding the job or deciding on a career. That's one of the reasons I am taking this class as a Junior, because I don't know what else to take. I can't decide what I want to do for the rest of my life. I would be so much easier if I had someone say you are going to be a business man or a teacher, take these classes, and don't suck it up like you have been doing for the first two years of your college career"". And I would be like ""OK, fine, I can do that"" and then I would do it, but probably not to the full extent of my ability. I have a hard time doing things to hardcore for an extended amount of time. I guess everyone is like that but even things I like to do, after time I start slacking, such as car audio fabrication. I like to build things out of fiberglass and my last project really sucked it up. I guess it was a learning experience but after a few days of working on it I got dismayed because it didn't look as good as I had hoped it would and finally said ""the hell with it"" and just finished it. Now I am ready to chunk it and start anew. But I like building things, so that my be the reason too. ",0
2453,"Ok so I just got back from a four hour study hour thing at the ZTA house. WOW the most pointless thing ever. I read maybe 10 pages. How am I supposed to study with 50 other girls there in the room? You don't have that much space and of course you want to talk about what happened last night and who ended up where, and blahblahblah. I know they have good intentions in making us do this, but 4 hours at one time is waaay too long to try to study. No one really got anything done. But hey it was fun- I got to bond more with my sorority sisters! Speaking of sorority stuff, I love it. At first, I was afraid I wouldn't like it, or that the girls wouldn't like me, but I Couldn't be having more fun. I have more friends than I thought I would have going into college, and they're real friends, too, not friends you ""pay for"" with sorority fees. I'm listening to music right now, and recently (as in the past couple of months) I've gotten more and more into music. I've always loved music, but ever since I dated a great guy who is a complete music person I've liked it even more. Today kyle and I (my aggie ex-boyfriend) were joking about how pathetic we are for missing eachother so much. it was funny. we knew going into it at the beginning of the summer that we were going to break up when we went off to college because, of course, it wouldn't work. But now that we're all settled in, we still miss eachother. It got really serious really fast. it was unbelievably random. We never thought we would hook-up, but it happened and it was awesome. I hate to say it because I'm so young and I hate it when people say things like that, but I could quite possibly see myself with him after college- like permanently. That's so weird. Well, sincewe did break up, we are allowed to hang out with other people (date-wise) but neither of us really wanted to. Last week I met this really cool guy from the Woodlands-he's an ATO pledge. I've gone to a couple parties with him as his date and I kind of have a crush on him. It's exciting, but at the same time, I'm far from being over Kyle. The whole point of not being together was that we could go out and have fun without being tied down, but I still feel bad about it. I have constantly had this entire ""soap opera"" on my mind for the last week- nonstop. The cool thing about being in a relationship is that you have that stability- you never have to wonder if he likes you, or if he's going to call and all that. With a new guy it's always like I wonder if he likes me and why didn't he call?-worrying. It's fun, don't' get me wrong, but it kind of puts ur confidence in check. I've recently gotten into Maroon 5 again. I used to love them, but working at Hollister and hearing the entire CD all the time made me hate it. I don't work at Hollister anymore, so I havent heard Maroon 5 in awhile, and now I love them again. ",0
1199,"Well, I just got out of class this morning. It was pretty boring. One whole hour of lecturing. Normally, I wouldn't mind learning things from professors or teachers. But this course seems a little too easy right now. I still remember all this stuff from high school. And on top of that, this guy has such a monotonous voice. I feel like I'm going to fall asleep every time I'm in his class. I don't mean to be rude, but I can't help it. Fortunately, this morning, I was able to keep myself awake considering the amount of sleep I got. Wow, only about 4 hours of sleep last night. I think it's my own fault though. I stay up late and don't really do anything productive when I know I should be sleeping. I think I need to force myself to go to sleep earlier before school REALLY kicks in. From what I've heard, electrical engineering is a really tough major. Seems like no one has a social life at all anymore. And the ones that do try to keep a social life alive seem to be struggling with school a little bit. I wonder which I will be? I see myself stuck in my room or the library cramming knowledge into my head. Probably not because I want to do well in school but because everyone else is doing his or her own thing. Haha. Well, deep inside, I really do want to do well in school. Mainly for the reason of my mom. So many things have happened within the past couple years. Major life affecting changes have occurred recently, and now my life is so not where I saw it several years back. I'm not sure what happened. I don't think I'm being punished for anything, but it seems like bad things keep happening to me. I don't want to sound pessimistic, but it really seems true. I mean, I know I have a good life. I appreciate all that I have. I know I am a lot better off than a lot of people. But it's sometimes you feel at least SOME things should go your way. For instance, I have never really had good luck with girls. Not because I don't know what to do mind you, but because I have always had bad timing. It was always not the right time or something was going on at the moment. I finally decided to give up until college. And now that I'm here, things still don't really seem to go my way. Maybe I'm speaking to early because college has only just started. I'll wait and see if anything good happens before I jump to any conclusions. College is still another 4 years ahead of me. Even now, I'm still just getting hit by the fact that I'm in college. Seems like just yesterday I was entering high school. Those were the days. Barely any homework, had time to watch TV, just do a lot of things you want. I never thought it could get any better. Then college hit. So many things to do here and to experience. There are so many people here. Such a wide variety. I've already made several new friends. I'm doing a lot better with my social life here than I did in high school. There, everyone was just a ""sellout. "" I think it was where I grew up. Going to Clements, a rich school where a lot of rich people went. I'm not saying I'm filthy rich, but I'm not poor or anything either. Anyway, when I look back, it seems like there were a lot of snobby people back there in Sugar Land. I'm so glad that I met the friends that I have now. They are a lot more like me personalitywise than the people in Clements. ",0
1894,"  College, in itself, is a completely new experience for me. Before I began I was mostly nervous about the academic aspect of it. I was afraid that I would not be able to handle the academic challenge of college here at the University. However, now that I am a week into classes, I feel more comfortable and more confident. My classes are challenging, but I feel like I can meet that challenge.      College is different for me in another way as well. I am from San Antonio, so I am away for college. I am not far at all, but I am still away. I am very close to my family and friends so it is a little hard for me to be away from them. However, I am not feeling homesick at all. I do miss my family and friends back home, but I do not have that want or urge to go back home to go to school. I am becoming very comfortable in the environment that I am in. I am enjoying meeting new people and encountering new experiences.       Before I left to come to Austin, I met this guy and we became a little more than just good aquaintances. I liked this guy a lot because he listened to me and understood me. We had gone through very similar situations concerning our past with family, so it's more like we understood each other. It was because we understood each other so well that I became convinced that this guy was my soul mate. I loved him for the person he was. However, I was confused and thought that this meant that I was in love with him. It wasn't until just recently that I discovered that i wasn't in love with him. All this time I feel like I was leading him on to believe that I loved him, and I thought that I did. He did absolutely everything for me. He sent me flowers, came up here to visit me for just a few hours, bought phone cards for us to talk on the phone for hours, and so much more. How is it that I could not be in love with this person? When I told him how I felt just a few days ago, he felt so betrayed. He thought that I had been lying to him this whole time about my feelings. Was I? I, myself, didn't even know exactly how I felt. And the worst part is that I couldn't even explain myself clearly to him, which made him so confused. He thought that it was something he did wrong that made me not love him. I don't want to hurt him because I do care about him a lot and, like I said before, I do love the person he is. I just can't give him the same affection he gives me. I can't make myself love him like he loves me. I feel so selfish for doing this, and I don't know what to do about it. I wish there was something I could tell him that would make him understand. But even if he understood, that wouldn't stop him from feeling hurt and rejected.   ",0
1094,"Hi I'm Ben. I've been looking forward to this assignment since I heard of it. How often do I get a chance to get credit for babbling on a blank sheet of computer. I apologize. I can't spell to save my life and the point of this is to write not to write well. so anyway. I'm listening to emenem right now. I don't want to give the reader the impression that I'm into the popular mtv crap music that is so prevalent now, its just that it has a good beat and I can type fast to it. man I pity whoever has to read this. Let me ask you a question: have you ever considered that there isn't one universal reality but actually a different reality for every person on this planet. I was at a party this weekend and this thought was on my mind (no I wasn't high). I mean think about it. I'd go into this more but I'd have to stop typing and try to organize my thoughts more and that would just slow me down. I really like UT. that was on my mind. ok here comes the random babbling. I like Austin. people here are like no other on the planet. if ever a situation existed for an all out consciousness revolution it would be in Austin. so anyway, have you ever read any james joyce. he sucks. I can't stand him. I brought that up because he has the same weird ass choppy writing style that I'm using right now. I usually don't like to write like this. my papers usually make much more sense and my thoughts are much more clear. I suppose I could try to flub this and actually write instead of babble but I promised my roommates this would only take 20 minutes, they want to start a movie and they are waiting on me. wow that first 9 minutes really flew by. I'm a Japanese major. Now if you were wondering "" wow I wonder what this dorky lower classman's major is? "" you know. I feel bad that you have to read all this mental defecation. ok what am I thinking about now. I guess I'm thinking about the way I think, and I guess that's the point of this assignment. congratulations. I usually think in words. unless I'm inebriated then I think in pictures. I don't like thinking in pictures because things are so hard to communicate. hmm this is starting to get old, not to imply that I have a short attention span but I somehow pictured this differently. I thought about mapping all my thoughts about the previous thoughts on reality in general. now I've decided that is just to strange to submit to some stranger (no offense) in the psych department. Whoever reading this should read the principia discordia and the illuminatus trilogy. While I'm telling you what to do, you should vote for Gore. Aww here's something I can write about: politics. I hate and fear George bush. the fact that his slimy presence has to disgrace the great city of Austin is quite the insult. his Christian pro life beliefs coupled with his yen for the death penalty confuse and aggravate me. I rue the day the Christian right gain presidential power. I also am happy I worked ""rue"" into that last sentence. aww yeah. Well it looks like my writing time is coming to an end. I also played with the idea of getting hellasiously wasted before doing the stream of consciousness assignment. I'm glad I didn't this paper is crazy and disjointed enough already. ok well farewell random psych guy who read this. I will always hold a special place in my heart to you. well not really and that should relieve you. I promise you I'm not crazy. Well no more than anyone else. keep it real brother man. ",0
1036,"This is my first actual assignment of college so far. I've gotten all the homework assignments and practice problems, but this is the first one that really counts. At least it is the first assignment that I know of that really counts. Of course, I'm not exactly sure what the professor is looking for, but I'm doing my best. I'm just hoping I'll get a good grade for this. So far, I'm having a lot of fun here in the lovely University of Texas at Austin. It's a lot of work, but then again, I know it will pay off in the long run. And despite the small forest I've killed so far making flash cards for Spanish and Medical Terminology, its actually kind of fun. I like being busy, and I like doing things that lead to something bigger. In this case, it will hopefully lead to medical school. But that's enough about school, after all, I only live on campus, I'm surrounded by it! I'm in a great mood today and I have no idea why. I'm really hyper, and I didn't really do anything that unusual. I didn't eat an entire bag of Pixy Stix or anything. I did go swimming today, not nearly as much as I used to, but apparently it was enough to actually get some endorphins (if that's right) pumping. Now all I need to do is keep up that routine. I'm wide awake, and ready to go, even it is eight o'clock in the evening, and I have about a dozen other things I should really get around to doing. At least I'm organized though. I didn't really think that would pay off that much in school at least not right away, but it is. I can't wait until my birthday; I'll finally be eighteen! Its kind of funny how much a birthday can mean. Even though it's not that big of a deal, it's still exciting. Although the only thing I can do is go to clubs and join the military, and neither of those are exactly my kind of thing. It'll be nice to have people stopping and being completely amazed that a seventeen year old is actually in college. Will wonders never cease? Oh well, its all fun and games and it means presents! Shallow, but its nice to get things. Especially when you're one of those people who usually manages to remember everyone's birthday, even if it is a few days or weeks late. What matters is that I remember! I just like doing things like that, it makes everyone feel special, as pathetic as that sounds. I feel like this is the most incoherent thing I've ever written. I'm just rambling all over the place, but I hope this is what the professor is looking for. If this is stream of consciousness, I'm amazed anyone can actually read this kind of thing. It would drive me crazy to have to read all this rambling. As completely crazy and illogical as what I have written is, its nice to just be able to switch subjects like mad. It's a nice change from the whole introduction, body, and conclusion type of paper. Still, this style of writing is very refreshing and it's a lot more challenging than I thought. I've never really sat down and tried to follow my thoughts for twenty minutes. I guess I just don't have that much to think about, judging from what I have written. And it's sad because I've actually written a fair amount of absolutely nothing. Who would have guessed I could spend twenty whole minutes just writing this kind of thing? ",1
1834,"     I've been thinking about relationships lately. As we speak my mind is bewildered with thoughts of my ex-girlfriend that i was with for over a year, and the new girl im dating. Im still friends with my ex, but she still loves me and im not in love with her any longer. This new girl means the world to me, she is a nice change of pace for me. It's something new and I like it, but I can't help but still have feelings for my ex. I think the reason is because I was in a sexual relationship with her for a year, my first sexual partner. And I think that keeps me tied to her in a way. And the problem is when I'm with this new girl, I'm very turned on and want to be with her sexually but for some reason I can not get aroused, if you nkow what I mean. It's not that I don't want to, because I do, but for some reason I'm just not able to. I wonder why this is? Why can't I just have another healthy sexual relationship with this new girl. Is it me? What can I do to fix the problem? Should I just stop thinking about it and eventually it will pass over time? Or will this be a chronic thing? Im in a bind because I don't want to offend this new girl by not getting aroused with her. I don't want her to think I'm not attracted to her. God, I can't wait to see her! She lives in Dallas still, she's a year younger, so I can only go back in town on occasion to see her, and what makes it even worse is the temptation from my ex, because she goes to college here with me. And she has already taken advantage of me when I was drunk. Should I tell this new girl this? What good would it do? I'm not going to volunteer the information to her, but if she asked me I definitley wouldn't lie to her. When I broke up with my ex I wanted to be free, I mean I was going to college and I wanted to see what possibilities there were for me without the weight of a girl friend on my back. But then just a week after we broke up, I found her!! And she makes me want to go back to a relationship state. She likes me how I am, but I like to try and impress her as much as I can. I find myself spending  a lot of moeny on her! Plus, I'm taking a weight lifting class here to make myself look better, not just for her, but myself too, but I definitley want it for her because I know she would like to see me with more muscles. She's so beautiful! Her face pops up in my head everyday. I see her face on everyone I meet! Am I in love again? I hope not. I don't want to fall in love with someone I can't be with do to where we live. That would hurt too much. I have to be close to the person i love. So I will not let myself fall in love again. I can't let it happen. But I'm afraid it will, I know she is falling in love with me, but I got to hold back. I got to be strong. I can't wait till I go back in town in october. I'm taking her out to a haunted house, I love them , she hates them. Meaning she will be clinging to me like white on bread. I love when she puts her arms around me. I love when we're fooling around she takes my shirt off. She's very aggressive. . . god I love that. An aggressive woman is very attractive in my eyes, a woman who will take control is somethign rare, and she posesses it. I so want to get more physical with her, but I'm afraid because you see, she's a virgin. . . I'm not. I don't want to steal her innocence. She's so sweet and innocent, I don't want to corrupt that, especially when I don't know if there is a definite future for she and I. What do I do? I think she wants to have sex because of all the signals she gives me when we're fooling around but I'm not too sure. Do I go ahead and go for it? Or will that just make me fall in love with her, which I stated before I didn't want to do. Man, she makes me so jealous! I have never been jealous, but for some reason she makes me. I guess it might be because I'm not there with her, and i know she hangs out with all these guys, and osmetimes its just her and a guy. That pisses me off, I mean I trust her, but one of the guys she hangs out with is an ex-boyfriend of hers, who makes it very clear that he is still madly in love with her. So how am I suppsoe to take that? god!! I wish I wasn't jealous, I mean she and I are just dating and I'm already this jealous. I was never this jealous in my entire previous relationship. She makes me so happy though. She can do nothing wrong! She is my everything and I think about her constantly! I think I love her! ",1

1743,"During the weekend, I love to go to mall. To buy something that makes me feels good. If I have a chance to go in the mall, First, I would like to eat something in the restaurant because I get starve. I love to eat Chinese food. Sometimes I choose sweet sour chicken and fried rice. That is my favorite food. If I have a second choice that it would be pepper steak and white rice. When I am full, I start thinking of what I need t shop around other place to buy  what I need. At this time , I need to buy fall season cloths. All I have right now is one pair of jean and one sweater. That is not enough to wear for the rest of the season. All I need is one more extra sweater and another pair of jean. And then I would like to buy something to decorate my house. I would like to have of book holder because I have lots of books. Whenever I see interesting things on TV I would like to go to the mall and buy it. In my kitchen, I saw a microwave is not working anymore. On TV the commercial shows they are having a big sale in JCPenney. It cost about only sixty dollars. I think that is a good deal to buy a microwave for sixty dollars. I try to get a new laptop. But my budget is not enough to buy another computer. They are a pretty good deal for a Dell computer in a market place. The computer market is having a pretty good mark down of price now. But when I get everything together, it cost over one thousnad dollars  I need to spend all of it. I think the computer is popular consumer in the market. But i make a mind that I don't  want to spend not much money, because it is not worth it. Spending is not the way to feel better. How are you going  to control your mind is better way to concern it.   We are so busy living in collage life.  Everyone needs a rest in the weekend. Shopping in a mall is good subject of good things to relax your mind. Control you're budget and thinking of controlling your mind is the best way to think.        ",1
2465,"Man this week has been hellish. Anyways, now it's time for the 20 minute writing assignment. I'm pretty exhausted at the moment, and have a lot of studying to do tonight. My eyelids are pretty heavy, my hair damp. I just got out of the shower because I was working out. I think I have developed a pretty noticable case of ADD (attention deficate disorder) from various substances. It's difficult for me to keep writing without my mind wandering. My friend just walked in the room talking about some funny asian kids next door to us. Now its going to be even harder to concentrate. He just said the word tit. It's such a funny word, I'm sure you would agree. My mouth tastes like butt, I need to stop smoking cigarettes. Crap, I just looked at the time and realized I didn't record what time I started at. I hope this thing is timing it for me. ""Simply type continuously, tracking your thoughts and feelings for the entire 20 minutes. "" My thoughts are scrambled. So much to soak in, so much going on. Individual words strike up new emotions about various subjects. My friend said the word mom, I thought of my mom. I don't want to go home and probably wouldn't except for the fact that my mom misses me so much. I keep getting distracted by music that I'm playing, it's probably not best to be listening to it while working, but this is an informal assignment (if I remember correctly) so hopefully I'll be fine. I can't wait for tomorrow to be over and the weekend to begin. The band I'm listening to is called The Roots, they'll be playing next weekend at ACL. I'd really like to see them there, they are a really good and well known hip-hop group. Tix are 80 bucks so its doubtful ill be going all 3 days, maybe I'll just get a one day pass. I could also meet a lot of people at the ACL fest (hopefully). I feel kind of lonely at the moment, I thought I would have made a lot more knew friends here at the university by now. It seems to me that most people are still hanging out with their friends and clicks from high school, kind of lame in my opinion. I hang out with my roommate and another friend from high school, most of the time the latter. We go out and attempt to seek out other people like us, whom we find unique or ""cool. "" One major complaint I have about the people here is that it seems like everyone is still trying to prove themselves. Just like high school, except more facial hair. I might just be depressed and seeing everything in a negative light, but at the moment it all seems logical to me. My friend just came back in the room. He's cool. We're going to go study chemistry as soon as I'm done with this assignment. Man I need to stop chatting on the internet, my typing is really horrible. I keep forgetting to capitalize letters, and I keep spelling things incorectly. Like I was saying, it's a pitty that everyone here seems so fake. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of people that seem really interesting, but at the same mind it sickens me how everyone conforms to certain styles and clicks. god damn, grow up people. Everyone's trying so hard to get laid. Please don't grade me down. I can't help but writing about this crap, it consumes me. Writing this actually hasn't been hard at all. Right now I'm feeling a little more relaxed and lighthearted than I was before writing. it might be a good idea to start writing regularly. It could be good for me, and I think it's cool when people do things like that. I love writing, but not necessarily structured writing. I wonder how long it's been. My whole body is tired, man I'm lonely. I need a girlfriend! Party's are NOT a good way to meet girls here, stupid sluts just looking for a good time. It seems like there are less people here like me than I thought there would be. I was expecting a more mature student body. Don't get me wrong, I like partying, I love getting drunk, I love having fun. I don't know where I'm going with this. It just seems people here are kind of stuck up on themselves, and not as intelligent and interesting as I thought they would be. Oh well, we all can dream. ",0
602,"I want to see my friends and my parents. can I go home? I lied to my parents. they don't like me too much right now. maybe even hate. I feel sorry. disgusted. hate for myself. I shouldn't have done that. but I'm an adult. ,I should do whatever I feel and they should just except it. turn that music off. my roommate listens to some weird stuff. what is that? it's depressing. I don't like it. it makes me homesick. why? it doesn't even remind me of home. gee, I want to listen to some rap but I'm sitting here writing continuously. is that how you spell it. it's hard to type what you think when you think it. even though they said not worry about grammar and all, I'm still worried. what if the professor thinks I'm stupid because I can't type. what if I am stupid because I can't type. thank got for backspace. anyhow, what is this for. why am I typing this. I need to do it. it's homework. I need to do homework. I feel bad. confused. wrong. should I take notes while I read in my textbooks. I don't know. I feel like an outcast when I don't take notes in my classes. should I? should I be writing down everything the professor says. should I? I'll find out when we take our first test. then when I fail, I can say now I know what to do when the problem could have been solved in the beginning by the teacher saying, please take notes because everything on the test will be from lecture. you bought the book because the university needs another way to spend money they know you don't have. ha! that was funny. okay, where was I. thinking still. I'm hungry. I can't stand the food at jester but I eat it like I've never had food before. it's just there and it tells me eat me fat boy you paid for it so eat it. I try to tell myself to find something descent like the gourmet pizza, not, or the soybean burgers but I keep getting in line to have that crappy stuff ion the choices line. never anything worth getting but I still eat it. Why? I miss home cooking, not that my mother ever cooks but McDonalds serves as a home cooked meal for me since that is what we had for dinner a lot when I was growing up. McDonalds is good. I like the nuggets? barbecue sauce is the bomb. one time I went to McDonalds and they wouldn't give me any barbecue sauce. bastards. anyway, what was I talking about. so, I miss my home. I miss my friends. I called each of them the first week I was here. they all stayed at home to go to college there, or joined the military, or just didn't go to college. Oh well, their loss because it's fun up here. actually, it's fun in san antonio where I live. I would probably not be going through anything like I am here if I were to stay home. I needed this in my life, to experience new things and new people. funny though, there aren't that many Mexicans here at UT. I mean there are tons of Asians, blacks, Indians, and of course white people but there aren't that many Mexicans so I guess there are people other than Mexicans in the world because in san antonio that's all you saw. Mexicans. man my friend jason is so cool. I miss my friends from work. I used to work at cici's pizza, the best pizza value anywhere buffet for only 2. 99 you come and see us. , I always plug the restaurant to whomever I speak or whatever, anyway I don't know why because the food really sucked. yeah, it was bad. really bad. rats and roaches. that's all that comes to mind when I think of cici's. yeah, and pastries. everyone that worked there threw parties. they were the bomb. I went to so many when I worked there. anything and everything went at a cici's crew party although others were invited too. they were fun. I miss people at work. I remember dating this grill I worked with never date anyone you work with. people talk and shit happens and it really sucks. frustration. anger. anyway, that reminds me of my ex-girlfriend now. she makes me cringe. probably because of the shit she put me through but mostly because every time she left me a message she would play a song from the radio. I guess that's why it's hard to listen to the radio and not think of her. disgust. , hate. pity. sadness. mistrust. bitch. I thought she was the one. / no I didn't I just say that to sound normal. she really didn't mean a lot to me only that she loved me so I felt bad that I didn't love her so I told her I really cared for her but I didn't. I lie to everyone I guess. even myself. sadness. silence. hurt. I don't know what else to write. nothing comes to mind only blackness. I hit a chord as I wrote that. is it true. I hope not. I never mean to be dishonest. I only tell the truth to hurt people and that's wrong. not always but I just feel funny when someone feels a certain way and I don't feel that way back. you know? anyway, that's all I'm going to say about that. is there any gum around here? found some it's good. juicy fruit. is going to move you it gets right to you, the taste the taste the taste is going to move you. okay, commercial. anyway, I wish I had a tv right now. I miss cable . I love to watch comic view and BET and MTV and comedy shows. tonight is seinfeld. that show is hilarious although the series finale sucked. very disappointing. I was mad. upset. I had to tape it because I had a band concert that night. band. bad memories. some good. i wish I played better so I could do something with it but I never practiced on my instrument. I never applied myself. another hidden talent gone to waste. what about college. apply myself? hopefully and succeed. want to graduate but not too sure on them probability of it. hope so. want to please myself as well as my friends and family. don't want to let myself down but I don't know if I want it that bad. sniffle. sadness.

471,"She kind of put me in a depressed mood for the passed few days because she started telling me that she often writes her dad in trying to make her feel better, and it does,  It kind of put things into perspective for me because I wouldn't know what I would do in her situation. well now that I am back in Austin I try to  work hard  and try to get thing s like this off my mind. not that I necessarily want to  because  that   would be bad. well now the people I am with right now are bothered because I am using their computer and I don't want them to see what I am typing, I usually feel this way with anything I do, I don't like any one seeing or reading g anything that I  write, do, or accomplish   the  time isn't really going by to fast right now . I have so much in my head put can't think about it right now. I am a  strange strange  person. everyone always tells me that because I always hold back my thought and when I want to let them out my mind draws to a blank. it gets me frustrated, good thing that I work out to work off my frustration. the life is tough, that is what my dad always says, and it is. I don't know how he made it here and have 5 kids have successful lives. my parents have done a good job, they really have. but know in trying to give so much more than they had it's hurting them financially and I feel that me going off to college is putting an even bigger debt in their pocket book. But they tell me not to worry about so I tell them not to worry about me, I also tell them  that if anyone is going to go in debt it's going to be me. let me pull out the loan s in my name let me do all that I   will   be able to take care of it in the long run. right now I'm just tired of being a burden I know what I have to do and  I am going to do it. I have done this type of assignment before, I once turned it in as a paper, and my teacher loved it, it was more in the structure of  a poem, it ended being about 20 pages long and my teacher said it was outstanding, and nobody even believed me when I said that I was going to turn in that abstract paper and they didn't believe me when I  told them that the teacher actually liked it. and that is 20 minutes.

1309,"At this time in my life, my feelings have been tossed around in my mind. My stress level at the moment is much then I think that it has ever been. From what I have heard, the degree of difficulty in college is the highest possible. This worries me because I know that I am able of fulfilling my college experience, but the problem for me will be if I am able to apply myself. Application is an important aspect of college, and I really do not know if I will be able to focus as much as I should on my schoolwork. Another thing that has raised my stress level is women. With women, my mind has many feelings. One minute I will want to be with my old girlfriend, and the next I want to be with a new girl. My mind thinks about it consistently. Sometimes in class I find my mind drifting into places that it should not. This is when my brain realizes that I need to be focusing more on school in order to fulfill my dream. The stress in my life eventually comes to raise my anger level, at least that is the way I see it. When I get stressed out, I tend to want to release my anger by playing hockey. I feel that it helps me release my stress and my anger because it is something that will always be there for me, and my mind knows that it will be. Therefore, I tend to play better when I am angered because I become more aggressive. At least this is what I have noticed while playing. Feelings are a strange thing. The stuff above, I wrote about two days ago. Now it seems as if my whole perspective on life has changed. My mind has just switched due to a few events that have probably changed the whole outcome of my life. My mind used to hate all schoolwork what so ever, but now that I have grown physically and mentally, I actually enjoy reading and learning new information. I do not know why it intrigues me, but for some reason it does and I like it. I have recently discovered that I love math and I believe that it is what I would like to do with my life. I am considering strongly of changing majors from business to some field of mathematics. I believe that it would be really interesting to be able to be a professor for a math class or to do something else in life that involves complications in mathematics. The thing is, I am afraid to change my major, because I kind of think that I might regret. Getting into the business school is a hard thing to do at the University of Texas, and many people would consider it a stupid thing to get out of it. But from what I have seen so far in BA101 it does not seem as interesting to me as math. I like math so much because there is pretty much always a way to compute the answer to a problem. Knowing and understanding how and why the fundamentals work is the hardest and most time consuming part of math. But once one understands the fundamentals of math, they are capable of doing any form of math problem similar to the one that they understand. For many people, math is the enemy of all subjects. I personally do not like memorizing history or stupid biology stuff. I believe that is why I like math so much, because it is much easier for me to relate to. In a way, my body almost feels deprived because I have not played hockey in nearly 3 weeks. When I used to play at least 3 times a week. I feel like I am not exercising and that I am becoming unhealthy. This weekend, I will hopefully be able to satisfy this hunger for hockey when I go home. Hockey is most likely my favorite thing to do in life, I believe that it is because of the adrenaline rush and it helps relieve stress. Without it, I think my stress level is higher then normal because the stress is not relieved like it is used to being released. College should be an interesting experience. What is to come I do not really know yet, but I am sure that it will be a very interesting experience. Like my sister said, just make sure that you have as much fun as possible and make as good of grades as possible. ",1
1053,"so many things to do. must read in rhetoric today. two whole chapters. I wonder if I should drop that class. she seems nice but only gives 3 or 4 A's. I could be one of those A's. but what if I'm one of those C's that she says are ""solid writers""?? wish I was a good writer. after I read must read chemistry and psychology if I don't start soon I'll never start. and lord knows if I get behind in any of my classes, I'll never catch up again. I'm glad that I bought the notes today for chemistry. now I know what to study. but it was expensive our professor must be making a fortune! can't wait until 7:30pm I can take a break from life and focus on me! me me me me. I'll finally be able to go to the gym and work out. I've gained so much weight already. I wonder if my boyfriend notices and just doesn't say anything. I bet he notices. he never complements me anymore. I'm a little disappointed in myself for letting my self go. I should've been more cautious about my eating habits. sometimes I just eat because there's nothing to do not because I'm hungry. I know that's wrong. to make matters worse my boyfriend is such a hard core work out freak. although I'm skinny, I'm slowly losing my girlish figure that attracted him to me. I know for a fact he can do better than me, but why is he with me? he says I'm everything anyone could ever want but I have so many flaws. for instance, I have the quickest temper and stubbornness in the whole wide world. my hair is still damp from taking a shower. that shower was good. it washed away the whole afternoon. all the stress. I hate being late. that's probably why I'm always half an hour early for all my classes. everyone thinks I'm a nerd but I just consider myself punctual. quite an overachiever. I like being an overachiever. it's the most commonly used word to describe me with. I always try to get ahead. that's why I'm always so stressed out. sometimes I wish I was not such a worry wart. I want to be laid back, really I do, but my happiness comes with having everything done and done on time and done well. the feeling of finishing and completing everything thoroughly and fully is the best feeling in the whole world. and that's what makes me an overachiever. this project isn't even done now. it's supposed to be done in a couple of weeks. I tried to do this project the day after proof. pennebaker assigned it but for some odd reason the site was down. I guess it just wasn't meant to be. hmmm. what should I eat for dinner. it's $0. 30 chicken wing night at pluckers. I live right above pluckers so it'd be easy to get to but I still have left overs in the fridge so I'll save myself the 3 or 5 dollars and eat in AGAIN. I wish I was rich. I wouldn't have to worry about how much dinner cost. I remember the day when it used to be like that. but I'm glad I ran away. I'm with jeff now and he's better than having all the money in the world. I kind of regret not going to boston college though. that was my dream. that was my huge sigh of relief after high school. that was the product of 12 years of overachieving. UT isn't bad. it's not great either. some people say it's like an Ivy League school but I highly doubt that. I would pick an east coast school over hicktown UT anytime. but since I'm here I have to make the best of this situation and endure the poor weather and large campus. six more minutes of writing. that means I can start thinking about what to do next. I think I'll read psychology since that's what I'm doing now. just the first chapter tonight then the first chapter in chemistry. that should do me for now then rhetoric I have to read chapters two through three. I think I've got it together now. 4 more minutes. wow, it's already been twenty minutes! this assignment relieved me of a lot of stress already! now I just have to read and take really good notes. no more online junk to take care of anymore. I have using the computer. don't people know that handwriting things is the best way to learn and memorize? well, I guess for me others love it. yes one more minute. I think I'll snack and study. it keeps me motivated. I guess that's it. I enjoyed this project! ",1
1983,"well I think this is a fun experiment. lets see, what am I feeling? I'm sick. and I can't stop sneezing and coughing. which is distracting as I try to write this. I'm not sure but as I'm writing this I go back and correct my spelling mistakes. I love rings I need to get some more. I only have one on my middle finger and its really pretty. man I can't believe I didn't say hi to brian this morning when I saw him. its so pointless to act like I didn't see him when I looked right his way this morning. god I hope doesn't think I'm some kind of moody bitch. I feel incompetent. I have no specialty. last night I tried writing 2 songs but it doesn't help that I don't know anything about songwriting or reading music or coming up with a beat. although I must say I have things to say. so at least that is good. I'm annoyed with myself for getting hung up on things that already happened. wait am I doing this wrong. this feels  more like a journal entry than just what am thinking in the moment. ok I need to stop reading what I just wrote. this room is dark I should open the blinds and jeez if my nose could just stop running. man I'm tired of typing already and its only been about 9 minutes. I need to call maz and ask what is up with our friend who I emailed 2 days ago and has not responded yet. I wonder if he is still in egypt and maybe doesn't have access to a computer. I want to paint my bedroom a light green or yellow color. does that say anything about me. god I feel nauseous. I don't even know how to spell that word. I have to stop eating weird combinations of food. I just had peach yogurt, garlic and parmesan cheese its and graham crackers with milk. I don't even have room for lunch. I must work out. god beyonce has a nice stomach in that baby boy"" music video. if I could lose another 23 pounds that would be awesome. I just need to work out. I need determination. that is such a powerful emotion. I need to buy more shoes and clean up this mess in my room. but it seems I clean it every other day. ok now I'm freaking out. I have 3 tests this week and I feel a little lost is most of them. boy I need some will power to . man I can't get over this nasty feeling of what I just ate. I feel so lost. what do I do. maybe a nice shower might help. oh only 30 seconds left. this went by faster than I thought it would go. and times up . I'm done! ",0
368,"being new in Texas and on a strange campus with a lot of different people that I've never met, and have no idea what their backgrounds or thoughts may be is weird to me. back home this wasn't the same. All my friends knew me and I knew them. They didn't care about my little flaws. My family was there to support me and care about me. now, I'm hear. alone and people are starting to show their real colors. At first the girls on my floor were accepting and sweet, but now everything has changed. They have this different feelings and thoughts about me. I may have done some things to upset them, just like they have done to me, but I am a forgiving person. I do not hold grudges like others. Which my sister says is a bad trait. guys down my hall, who used to be nice to me, now make fun of he way I talk, the way I dress, just generally me. its hurts a lot. I'm not the kind of person who shares my feelings with others very easily. I try not to let the things they say hurt me, usually they are just joking around. but, it still does hurt. no one likes to be made fun of. Maybe I'm scared of what people think about me. maybe I'm nervous and afraid because I'm in a totally new atmosphere and situation and nearly everyone else has their family and friends nearby, if not living in the rooms with them, the talk to. People who know about their mood swings and personality. but, I don't. At first I didn't think much about all this stuff. I was having a good time in rush and with all the new people I have met. But, things have changes and I kind of wish I had chosen to go to the school where all my home friends went instead of starting anew. but, I guess the reason I'm hear is because I wanted to get away. or at least I thought I wanted to get away. one thing I don't' really like to do is burden people with my problems, especially people I don' know. they usually end up telling me that I should think better about myself or that what I'm thinking isn't right. but, no one really knows what's right for me except me. I tell myself every night that tomorrow I'll try to be a little better at this and try to change that about myself, the things that people get annoyed with so that people will want to be my friend. but, I can't change how I've grown up. my family values have thought me how to be nice to others, but I had to learn on my own how to take it when those people that you think you're the nicest to and like the most can turn on you in a second. that just because you might say a nice thing about someone, that's doesn't mean that the next day they'll remember or even care enough to stop people from hurting you. My mom calls about three times a day. We're pretty close. but, when I was at home she'd annoy me because she always wanted to talk and be around me and I thought I just wanted her to go away. but, no its different. I call her too. I tell her everything that's happened to me that day and ask for advice. I thought I would be that kind of person, but I was wrong. I can't wait to go home and be with people that really know me and accept me right away. I don't' remember the last time I had to work at being someone's friend. I wish I didn't have to write this for so long. I just feel like I'm babbling about the same thing over and over again. I can't type very well either, so some of my words can only be read by dyslexic people. its alright. I'm trying to be as honest and open as possible. A couple of years ago I used to cry everyday. About nothing about something it didn't matter. I was going to go see a psychiatrist. I've never been to one but was always intrigued about what would happen if I went. I think for a little while I'd tell me parents that I HAD to go to one. I convinced them. I dot' know what that was all about. just a phase I guess. I'd still like to go to one. I can't see how someone could like the job of hearing other peoples problems for hors on end everyday. That would be totally crazy. When people tell me their problems I just think about mine and feel bad for myself. I guess I'm self centered or something. I hear people talking in my hall and wish that I could go out there too, but I promised myself that I'd get some work done before I went off to class. I really haven't eaten a lot since I've been here. I skip breakfast don't' eat lunch or dinner. Its crazy. My appetite has totally left. the food is really nasty here. Oh well. When I get home I'll make my parents take me out to a nice dinner. My boyfriend used to take me out to nice dinners, then for some reason her totally stopped. I'm kind of materialistic. or, at least that's what he'd say. but, I learned o accept it because I loved him. or at least I thought it was love. I don't' know yet, and I'll probably never know until I find someone who I feel the same way or more about. That hasn't happened yet. okay, times up. ",1
438,"I know there's nothing ""wrong"" I can write, but I still feel like whatever I'm writing may not be what they had in mind. It's about 11:20, and I am starving. As soon as I finish this I'll get to go and eat. I just came back from calculus, which is at least a 15 minute walk away from where I am (which is Dobie). I don't think I'm going to learn too much from the professor I have for calculus. He doesn't ever explain what the hell he's trying to do, and, like today when this guy tried to ask him, he almost yelled at him for jumping ahead. It is really frustrating because he first says something and then writes it down verbatim, and it makes me really mad. He wastes so much class time writing down the obvious even after he's said it ten times. I tried taking notes, but I doubt they'll help. I have always loved math, but this is just frustrating. My friend Ashli (who also lives here nad is from my tiny hometown) has a suitemate named Sonia, who had him last year. She said it's horrible. SLhe only knew two people who got an A in his class. She was telling me about how he writes down every little thing, and now I see what she means. She also said his tests are nothing like the homework, so I don't know what to expect. I am so hungry right now. I didn't eat too much this morning, because I never seeem to be hungry when I first wake up. My roommate is really sick. Ithink she has strep throat. Which means it'll only be a matter of daysbefore I get it too. My immune system has never been that good. I know, I know, I never really exercised that much, but I never seem tok have too much energy. My mom always thought I was anemic, but tests show I'm supposedly not. It's so weird how whenever I walk around campus I keep seeing people I know. Well, not really know, but I recognize them from camptexas or orientation or somewhere like that. I usually don't get to know too many people from placeslike that because I tend to be a little on the shy side. People always toldm e I'd outgrow that, but, well, I'm still waiting. In fact if there's onet hing I could change about me, ti'd probably be that. Everyone says you can make yourself  not be shy, but I'm sorry, I don't know how. I've tried and tried, but to no avail. When I'm around a lot of people I know, it's not too bad. Like in high school, I knew everyone in school (it's a small school and we've allb een together since kindergarten) and it was never too bad. I didn't love public speaking or anything where a lot of attention was directly on me, but I was always pretty comfortbale around everyone. But here I feel kind of lonely. My cousin, GArrod, who is a sophomore here, says it was that way for him lst year. I can't even reach one of my older friends here. I don't know what the problem is. And my other friend I called never called back. I don't know if she just didn't get the message, or if she's not calling back because she doesn't want to. My friend Ashli and I spend a lot of time together (we eat together and stuff) but she's already separating form me a little bit. At least we're going to the football game together. I'm looking forward to the game. I miss football. I never eallly appreciated it until I played powder puff last year. I somehow always feel like I'm overlooked because I'm quiet. At lest I hope it's because I'm quiet, and not just because I'm easy to overlook. I'm the youngest in my family, and whenever my older brother would be talking to my mom, she would always listen to him and ignore me, no matter what I was saying, until he left the room. Honestly, they thought because I am younger that whatever I say can't possible be as important as what he's saying. I could be telling her the house is one fire while he was telling her how he drove to town, and she wouldn't listen. Don't get me wrong, she has always been a great mom, but that has always bothered me, maybe more than it shoyuld. I don't really believe in those horoscope things, but sometimes when I have read them (at the end of theday) some eerie things ahave been true. Anyway, I read one of them on the ocmptuer. First of all, I have never been a ""typical"" sagittarius, like the magazines and articles say. They say they're all outgoing, and at times I am painfully shy nad introverted. Well, the one I read on the computer said the way to most hurt my feelings was to ignore me. And, that's true. If one of my friends is a total asshole to me, I will usual forgive them if they will just pay some attentin to me. I don't' think I have too many people in my life that I can count on, and that's really what I need most. I don't know if there's anyway I can fix that, but it's been a long 18 years. This probalby sounds like I'm a manic depressive, but before you call the authorities, let me assure you I'm not. I just don't have very high self esteem at times, and I often feel like I'm all alone in the world. I ahve a fear that I'll never find anyone to love me (like a husband). I don't see how someof  these other people manage to meet tons of guys, while I'm always alone. And most of those girls don't even appreciate them, and I know I would. Maybe it's back to the shyness thing. I really don't know, but I wish whoever did wuold tell me. I don't know what I want to do with my life. I was hoping my classes this smester would help, but I don't know. Part of me wants to go into business, but by the time I get accepted into the business school, I may change my mind again. I'm in the natural sciences thing as an undeclared pre-med right now, but who knows howl ong that will last?  I'm not lazy, but it takes me a hwile to get readjusted into going back to school. And even though I was in two ap classes my senior year and I graduated valedictorian by a long shot, I never had to work TOO hard in school. This stuff just came naturally to me. ",0
252,"  I am sitting here in front of the computer trying to write a constant flow  of my thoughts its about 1:30 in the morning the day of the first UT football  game that was successfully won by the Horns my roommate is sleeping right now  it seem that he sleeps almost 14 hours a day it makes me mad that for some  reason that it seems to me that he wastes time so much. All he does every day  is go to class, which I guess I should give him credit for that, and when  class is over all he does is sit in front of the computer and download things  or he lays in bed and watches TV or movies all day he is not that social  either he isn't part of a fraternity or any other group or doesn't play any  intramurals. He doesn't study whatsoever I guess I am just worried about  him because I care about him I mean we've been friends since the sixth grade. It seems kind of weird when we were in junior high he was the sociable type  and I was the reclusive type and about since the 10th grade the situation has  taken a 180 degree turn I hope they televise the 49er game that they are  playing against the Rams and even though most everyone especially my roommate  thinks that the 49er don't have a prayer I believe that this opportunity will  be a coming out party for JJ Stokes and the emergence of Jim Drunkenmiller the  last rookie quarterback to start for the Niners was Joe Montana hopefully a  good sign I am also kind of disappointed that I am not able to join the  professional business fraternities because they hold most of there meetings  when I have my CH301 extension course from 6 to7:30 PM but hey looking at the  positive side I have something extra to look forward to next year it sure is  great to be alive I feel like I am on top of the world everything is working  like clockwork I feel like watching Disney movies well it's about 2 o'clock  so I guess that I should go to sleep to rest for the world that lays upon me  tomorrow and remember to smile after all physical motion controls the mental emotion ( - :      ",1
1569,"     I awake. From sleep. I don't know. I walk to the window. Stop short. Who's there? A man calls out, I don't know his name. Because he is my father. Black night, cold rain. Stop. Before I choose I want to know. Stop. Awake. I can't. I don't. Even though you are there. The bird it flies. I stop to catch it's beauty, I have never seen this. I ponder my posture, I slant. You stood, you go to the store for some breakfast. I can't eat, you know that, but you insist. I refuse. We fight we braek we die. All for the love. The window it breaks. It shatters. Understand me, I am right. You don't know, you can't know. You don't understand. I can't seem to think with all the windows breaking. The grass is soft on my brown feet. My brown feet. My clown feet. My hair is dense. I see my reflection. I am cold. Who is that? The only thing I see is my reflection. It knows I'm here. I know I'm late. My hand hurts. I bite it off. It's full of nutrients. The back of my head aches, is it the clown? No it's me, I am your clown. I am your savior. The blue ice hates to see it go. The penguin, the clown, they get together. How am I going to tell my mom. Bloom. Prosper and perish. I die and you prosper. The only thing you am I know it is I can't. Follow the thought. Train your mind. Eat at Joe's. The full of my stomach eats at my liver. My house has the potential for greatness. The stops are all out. Pull me back into the water. I can't drown, I'm invincible, didn't you know? Ask me again. Try not to speak. Move your lips without speaking. Speak your lips without moving. I'm falling asleep and I don't think you can stop me. The game is mine. I have won and you have lost. Ask me agian. I ate your pony if you will play with me. The back of my head hurts again. My reflection is laughing at me. Black laugh, why do you do it? Brown feet,my mud is clean. My belt gets whiplash. A cornea operation. We play the game. Again, again,and again. I lose and lose, I can't help it. Yes i can, but i don't want to. It might hurt. Bow. Curtsey. Do your dance. Make the jester happy. Cornrows, fields of wheat. Ha! I laugh at your jokes. I'm crying. Confused, Understood. Understand. I can't . I missed my chance. The pondwater makes me ill. I'm done. It make me green. I'm green. We are all green. Does that pose a problem? No 'm not ask me again. Bye. Don't go. Don't even think about leaving. You cruel hateful person. Lampshade. Where the hell is my bloody lampshade?

1820," Today is thursday, September 12th. Yesterday was 9/11. I wasn't too scared about it cause I knew that nothing would happen. It was just kind of sad, I guess. Everytime I turned on the T. V. there was something about it. The sad stories, the encouraging ones about the heroes. By the end of the day, I was just kind of fed up with it. There was this one part that certaintly got my attention. On MTV, they were having this 30 seconds thing, where some people talked about something dealing with 9/11. THere was this one guy who had a long beard, and looked liked an Afghan, and he said that one day this guy just punched him out of no where, just because he looked like that. I think that is just so extremely stupid, he wasn't even an Muslim, he was a Shikh or something. I mean you cannot really blame the few that did that to the entire Muslim society. I mean there are 1 billion Muslims, they can't all be terrorists. But I don't really blame them, cause I mean even if I was in their places, I would kind of react the same way. Although, I would try not to. But, now things are changing. Not many people hate you just because one is a Muslim. Oh well, enough about this.   I saw this cute chick on 9/11. She was in the biology class. She was just sooo  cute. I should have talked to her, but before i knew it she was gone. Hopefully, i will see her next time.          Today was the draw for the texas-ou game. I didn't get the tickets, my draw number was on the 80000s, and the tickets were sold out at 79450. This kind of . . I mean only 450 people got to get tickets, i mean, why they couldnt more tickets for the students. I was really disappointed. But i am still a freshmen so maybe next coming years.          I am going home this weekend, first time after school started. I am really looking forward to it. Just need a few days away from UT. Its seems like I have been here more than 3 weeks. It should be fun.        I also have test coming up starting next week. Hopefully i will do good. I really need to make as many As as i can. I have to transfer to the school of Business, which is the hardest to get into. Hopefully, i will get in.          After i get done with this, i have to finish my Calculus homework. Its due tomm at 3 in the morning. What kind of time is that. Last week i didnt turn it in because i thought, it was 3 in the afternoon. I didnt look if it was p. m. or a. m. I was done with it too. I was sooooooo mad. I guess i learned my lesson though. BUt still, 3 in the morning, whats up with the time.          I had a quiz in Economics today, it was soo hard compared to the one last week. Last week's quiz was a piece of cake. IT was sooo easy. I hate when teacher/sorry professors do this. THey make the first test/quiz easy and the second or the final exam are like really hard. Be consistent, you know.         I have 3 minutes left, ummm,  This class is kind of fun. I like Dr. Penebaker, if i spelled that right, his examples and stuff are soo funny. But my Economics professor is just as cool, Dr. Hamermesh. Both of the class are fun. Cal and CHemistry are alright, not as much fun.        It is soo quiet in this lab, you could hear the roar of the computers. UT is weird, sometimes is soo quiet, while other soo crowded and loud. I guess i am getting used to it though. Well my time is up. It was fun writing this. Its kind of girly though, like a journal.     ",0
443,"I 'm doing this because for the first time all night my modem got out og dobve without the number being busy. I spent the whole night doing homework as well as most of the day. I'm really hungry right now which sucks because no pllace is open right now. I'm really happy I got bakc with my girlfriend last night. I went thrugh what I'd call semi depression during our breakup. I lost 20 lbs in 2 weeks and would eat maybe one snack cake per day. I was really forlorn. I cut all my facial hair, which took me 2 weeks to grow. I got  a short note from her last week saying she wanted to get bcak to gether. I called her talked and on Sunday night we went to Creed. / It was one of the best concerts I've seen I n a long time. I think I might buy that CD. Jeesze I'm starving. I  wish I could get a bite to eat. I have to be up a 7:10 tomorrow f or class, That really sucks that I havce to gfet up every morning at 7 while my roommate sleeps till noon. Its not faiR! I think I'jll call Leah ukp tomorrow. I haven't talked to her since Sunday. I miss her. It's pretyy cold in my room right now. Last night it was freeszing. My roommate brought over  his friend and wastched Pollitically INcorrect while I was trying to study how rude. She was disgustingly overweight. She desperatley needs to go on a diet. I saw this really fat guy at the concert last night. Weighted at least 500lbs. I hope he didn't take off his shirt during the middle fo the show otherwise that'd be gross. I'm getting sick of  listening to Pearl Jam and I 'm gettting really tired. Maybe I should skip my early class tomorrow. I was fine this mornign and around 5 I started becoming really drowsy. I don't understand how I can always be tired at 5-6 but then take 3 hours before I fall asleep. Well I'm going to bed. ",1
247,"Ok, I am really happy right now because after 2 weeks of BS, I've finally got my computer and Ethernet working so that I could do my psychology  homework. Cool, huh. Well, my best friend from El Paso just called me  and told me she's gonna get a tattoo, which I think is pretty dumb  because she's gonna be stuck with it for the rest of her life. See,  I would get a tattoo, like my zodiac sign or something, but I just  always see myself all grown up and old and wrinkly with a tattoo and I think I would feel pretty dumb for getting it then. Like,  right now I just have my ears pierced once in each ear and IÃ¯Â¿Â½d  like to get 2 more in my left ear and 1 more in my right ear but  its still kinda like IÃ¯Â¿Â½m gonna be to old for that kinda stuff in a  few years, you know?  What else can I bore you with?  Oh, my mom sent  me a package and I got it today, it was my dry cleaning and some pictures of my dog, Morton Taylor Moore, he's a basset hound. Taylor is  a family name, its my granddadÃ¯Â¿Â½s and my older brother's middle name. Hmmmmmm. . I'm like so happy that tomorrow is Friday, not like IÃ¯Â¿Â½m stressed out or anything, its just a huge adjustment to go from partying all the time in the summer to only partying Friday and Saturday night, I made a promise to myself that I wouldn't  go out on school nights. I really don't have much self control or discipline, but IÃ¯Â¿Â½m working on it. I was so happy last  night, I was in my next door neighbors room and everybody was  checking their email and I was just like no, no one has emailed me, but I tried anyway and low and behold, one of my best friends from El Paso had emailed me, I was so surprised. See, he was  suppose to move to Tullorosa, NM but it fell through when he  got there so he came back, but he's moving to Belize in a day or two but he told me he was going to be back in El Paso for thanksgiving except he didn't have a place to stay, and I really hope my mom doesn't  mind, but I offered to let him stay in our extra bedroom. Oh, then I  did one of the stupidest things IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve done in a while, I told him  that IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve had the biggest crush on him since the day I met him,  GOD I'M DUMB!!! oh well, its over and done with now, can't change the  past, huh. It'd be cool if you could change the past though cause god knows IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve done a whole lot of dumb things in my life. ok, sorry, my  twenty minutes were up 2 minutes ago so have a nice day.

1809,"     Ok so im sitting right now in my dorm room writing my first ever college assignment. College is not at all what I expected. Its pretty much highschool except you don't have to attend your class and theres no curfue. My dorm has been asssigned (some might call it imprisoned) in Jester. Its quite a new experience. I awoke last night at exactly 3:43am to find my neighbor blasting rap music. Now I am not one for rap music and especially not at night. Not knowing what to do I layed there in misery and ignored the 100 decibal speaker system which I was dreaming about smashing. Now that I think about it next time this happens i'm marching right over and banging his door down. College is such extreme independance in my life that at times I cannot handle it. Back in highschool I had a midnight curfew, now I can come in at 4 am and no one can say anything. I can eat cookies and chips and never eat actual food and theres no one to stop me . But this is not the reason I came to college. I was not escaping my parents, I came to UT because my views and beliefs are shunned and immoral according to my smal texas Baptist town. I remember recieving an F on an English paper in which we were told to write about our feelings and my feelings were inapprpriate. How can someones beliefs be inapropriate? UT is the most liberal college in Texas and even though I can barely afford it to me being exposed to different views and being able to share my views on life without being blacklisted are worth every student loan I have to take out. Now I do not know what I am   not allowed   to type in a college paper. Am I allowed to tell you that I am an aethiest? Am I allowed to tell you that I loathe culture. Well whether I am or not I do not care anymore. I cannot stay trapped inside and never know if others share my views. Its a horrible feeling to not be able to speak out. Its the worst kind of hell anyone can go through.  I cannot express even to myself how much i find people who have religous beliefs stupid and ignorant. Religion is a sorce of comfort for the idiot and a powerful tool for a leader. Anyone with the slightest bit of common sense can see that the three main religions in the world , Christianity , Judaisim, and Islam are almost identical and yet they all are an excuse for war and money. Religion is bullshit, its all a story made up my a power hungry man who proclaimed himself the son of god to gain a following. If others are allowed to express their love for God then it is not wrong for me to express my hatred of him.  I look forward to this class and intend to make the most of understanding the stupidity of some human pysche. Even though im an engineering major I find this subject interesting and intend on embedding what i learn in this coure in my mind for the rest of my life. ",0
2177,"My window is just above my bed. I can't see the stars but the lights of the city substitute nicely. I wish my bed were higher so I could lay in it and look out the window over the city. This is the one place that I feel on top of the world even though lately my world has been crumbling down. I see the cars going by, some steadily others as though they were racing. and the last remind me of my drum major in high school who used to yell at us for lollygagging. "" I imagine they are going to exciting places. Places where they don't worry if their boyfriend is cheating on them or why they can't seem to motivate themselves to do the assigned readings for class. I pretend for them. I make them my social group. I have named the girl who sits on the wall outside dobie Lisa. I think its a nice name. She is always out there to smoke cigarettes, I imagine because her roommate is the type that is anal and can't stand to have the rules bent much less broken. Lisa hates that. That is why she wears shorts 2 sizes to small that make her legs dimple while she is perched atop the wall. I am lonely. When I look out my window I feel like everyone else is too. We are a disjointed people connected by this city, these lights and sounds that are the stuff of civilization. I'm sure someone else is in that blue building with the step-like structure. sitting somewhere looking out, feeling the same as me. I like it when it rains, when the sky is heavy and dark and sad. I wish it would rain here. I have never seen that from my window. I think that I might like to live in a tall building like this later on in life, but I would have to live there alone. Its hard to bask in my emotions while my roommate debates who loves who more with her feminine boyfriend before they discuss what they're going to do for their umpteenth month anniversary. My suitemate fits me better. I feel how she acts, but I can't express myself that way for too many reasons. one very big one being my excessively religious parents. They would flip. No one understands my thoughts. I care so much more about the whys than the what is, but I act the opposite. I wish I could do nothing but read all day. I'd go in the living room in the pappazan or however you spell it chair by the window in there-but it would have to be higher too--to see out the window. That is what connects me, keeps me here, keeps me from floating away. So I would sit there and I would read. I would go all sorts of places and be all sorts of people but my window would be my anchor as I sailed through these many parallel universes. I think my favorite would be in a Jane Austen novel. they're so warm. There's such a sense of how to act without ever having to think. I wish I didn't think. I try to keep myself so busy that I don't, but my mind won't be constrained. Its only controlled by the window, my looking glass sanctuary. Its solitude without loneliness. I feel the most lonely with lots of people. on the south mall at noon, walking to class. So many people with such well put together lives, purposeful strides and slender hips. I watch them. I am behind a tree. I wear long skirts to cover what I wish wasn't there, with my thick dark hair pulled back, tugging on my wrinkled shirt that won't ever stay into place. I am magic though, I have powers. I can be invisible. No one ever knows that I'm there. No one ever knows I'm at my window with its menagerie of colored lights. I don't know about anything anymore. I wish someone would just tell me what I'm supposed to do. that there was some fated order of things. That would be easy to accept, that is why we have religion. It gives you all the whys and leaves you only the what is. but for some of us that won't suffice. No doctrine will halt the whys of my mind, I will always wonder about it if not the things it claims. I'm confused and lonely and at my window. It doesn't make sense. But tomorrow I'll get up and I'll go to class. I'll say hi to all my friends and smile. The weird thing is I'll even enjoy it and be distracted so that I only focus on the what is. I'll watch TV and do homework, and probably even go to a club with the cute guy I can't ever date because he happens to be my untrustworthy boyfriends cousin. (yes there are so many problems). But then I'll go to bed. I'll lie and look out the pane that sensitizes me to my pain, and I'll think about all the whys of my life and how I'll probably never figure them out, just how to distract myself from them. ",0

2289,"OK, so I'm sick and I don't feel good. But I feel better than yesterday and last night. I woke up about a million times last night feeling horrible and my temperature just kept climbing. I finally took some Tylenol at about 4am this morning and I woke up later sweating, so I hope that means I broke the fever. Now I just have this stupid cough to worry about. I hate coughing because it hurts my throat. I need to call my voice teacher and tell her I can't come to lessons today because I'm sick. Which sucks because I haven't had a lesson in forever. And she's the best teacher I've ever had. I guess keeping the extra money is good. Ugh. I'm coughing again. It sucks. My dog is looking out the window. I have a lot of studying that I need to do today. I need to catch up on a bunch of stuff so that I hopefully can go to Dallas tomorrow to see Sister Hazel in concert again. But I seriously don't know if I'll be able to go since I'm sick. I'm on medicine, so hopefully getting another round in me today will help. Goodness this stupid clock is going so slow. I've only been typing for 4 minutes. I think 20 minutes is a bit excessive. There's not even a pause button. What is I have to go to the bathroom or someone comes to the door. Seriously. Plus, I want to lay down. I want to get something to eat and take my medicine. I need to call my voice teacher. So, I want to go to Dallas this weekend but I also want to stay to go to some stuff that's going on down here. Mostly because the guy I have a crush on will be there too. And he's been giving me very mixed signals lately. Which is so frustrating. I don't know what to think or how to act around him. I'm trying to act almost aloof, as if I don't care. Part of me thinks he's just toying with me to stoke his own ego. And I refuse to play into anyone's ego. I don't want to get hurt. It sucks. And this cooler weather is reminding me of couples. Being able to snuggle and all that. Not that I've ever had that. I'm 22 and I've never had a boyfriend. Which is OK. I don't define my self worth by a guy or if I've had a boyfriend or not. But sometimes I do think it world be nice. But it's whatever God has planned for me. If He thinks I'm not ready, then I'm not ready. I need to start spending more time with God. Just get my focus back on Him. So many things have happened these past few weeks and I feel that they've all been for a reason. And I'm graduating in December and I have no idea what I'm going to do. I'm excited and terrified at the same time. Will I get a job?  Where will it be?  Will I like it?  Will I actually get to end up doing what I want to do?  Why am I so scared to put myself out there sometimes?  The worst that can be said to me is no. There are always other options. If you want something, you've got to spend that time and effort it takes to make it happen. So I just called to cancel my voice lessons and my voice teacher is going to charge me for this week anyways because its a ""late cancellation. ""  Well, I know that, but it's not like I knew I was going to be running a fever. I mean, seriously. Have a little compassion. And my stupid thermometer just ran out of batteries. So now I can't even take my temp anymore. Guess that means I'll be making a Wal-Mart run later today. I need to get some more Vicks Vapor rub anyways. I hate being sick. I've always thought of myself as a singer and singers can't sing when they're sick. OK, only a minute and a half left. I can do this. I can get through it. If my cough doesn't kill me first. Blue skies, shining on me, nothing but blue skies do I see!  My dog is barking at something. She's loud and it's annoying. I need a drink of water. I want to be well. I need to study. I need to do a bible study. YES!  I'm done!  That's all, folks!  BYE!!!!!!!! ",1

1386,"I am about to go to my first sorority date dash with my boyfriend. It is at Malibu Grand Prix. We are going to drive race cars and play video games. The tv has a show on about a man that slit a nine year old's throat from ear to ear. I think that is disgusting. I can't believe our society has people like this. I am very excited about my date dash. However, I have been feeling very overwhelmed with school lately. There is so much reading in every class. I don't feel like I am ever going to get caught up. College is so hard. Tomorrow I need to go get a new backpack and shirt at the Coop. I am excited about the football game on Saturday. This is my first college football game. I think it is going to be very hot and miserable. I will probably complain a lot and want to leave at half time. My friends say that they aren't going to let me leave early. It should be interesting. I also have to go straight to work after the game is over. I am going to do a lot of homework on Sunday. Hopefully I will get a little more caught up. I feel very stressed about school. This week is better than last and hopefully next week will be better than this one. I know it is going to get better. The guy on tv is a psycho. He is now saying that God told him to sacrifice the boy. He thinks he did the right thing. That is ridiculous along with the insanity plea. It makes me sick that people can do these horrible crimes and then plead insanity. This guy is not insane he is just a sicko and I think he deserves the death penalty. Tomorrow I have to go to class from 9:3011:00 and then I'm going to take a huge nap. I haven't been getting enough sleep lately. I guess I will just get used to less sleep. This college thing pretty much sucks. Sometimes I wish I would have taken the easy way out and gone to the local community college. However, I am getting a much better education here at UT. I live at home and commute everyday. This is really stressful because I have to leave my house at least one hour before class actually starts. I am about to go out now and I think this was a very interesting assignment. I am probably going to be late to the house where we are supposed to meet. ",0
2294,"A steam of cousiness paper is kind of a weird thing to do, but in a way simple. At the moment all I can do is think about this paper and the impression I am going to make by putting down what I have to say. Will I sound smart, dumb, or  am I completely doing the wrong thing. Oh well I guess there is not to much I can do about it now. I almost waited until the last minute to do this and I was afraid that the system might be backed up or something, just like the prescreening survey. Wow!!! I waited until the last minute to do that and I was sitting at me computer for just about 4 hours. I guess that proves I procrastinate pretty often. Sometimes when events like this happen I try to fix the problem and I do good for awhile. For example I won't but things aside and and do things sooner than later, but after about a week, I am back to my old habits. Today I actually got stuff accomplished, but then ageing I didn't because, here I am a couple of hours before this assignment is due, trying to complete it. I am hoping that my internet connection won't crash or some other phenomenon, such as bad weather, won't affect me turning in this assignment. Thing of bad weather made me thing of all the unfortunate events that have happened due to the hurricanes in the Florida area. Bad weather, such as tornados, hurricanes, floods, is something that really frightens me. I think it is really a big fear of mine. When I hear that a tornado might be in the area, automatically, I thing the worst and am afraid for my life. I guess I just wouldn't want to go that way. Although its not a popular way to die, like cancer or drunk driving, its just scary to thing about. But after all the destruction in Florida there haven't been to many deaths reported, a lot more than there should have been. This is a very serious topic and never thought it would take me to this. I just hope the situation clears up soon and the areas recover as soon as possible. Recovery can sometime be the hardest thing to cope with and get through and that goes with any kind of recovery. Such as when you get in a wreck and have to recover from that or even recovery from a long night of partying and drinking. That requires a different type of recovery. my fr      ",0
29,"Stream Of Consciousness      As I sit behind this bleak, gray screen, I find myself wanting to yank my  dirty blonde locks of hair right out of their follicles. Sure, so far college has been a lot of fun. Why doesn't this program allow me to scroll down to  the next line without pushing ""enter""? Am I supposed to keep on typing without pushing ""enter"" until I hit some kind of barrier and can't type anymore?  Well,  I'm going to operate on the assumption that I should make my own right margin. Back to being completely stressed, I have so many things that I have to do  right now, that is, before tomorrow. So, why the heck am I doing this  assignment when I have until the 12th to turn it in?  I guess that's my nature. I tend to want to do the ""fun"" things first. If my mother could see me now, she would freak. I wonder what would happen if I got my upper ear pierced?  I bet my mom would kill me. She nearly freaked out when I had my belly button pierced. I feel extremely guilty for having done that behind her back, but I  feel even more guilty for upsetting her and ruining my innocence in her eyes. My roommate wants me to pierce her ear for her. I honestly don't think that I am capable of inflicting that kind of pain on another individual. Sure, I can  pierce my own bellybutton, but when I see another person in pain, I feel twice as bad as they most likely do. Oh well, I'll just give Tracy the money to go  have it professionally done. This pushing ""enter"" is really beginning to  frustrate me. I keep typing way over the right limit and having to erase and go back and re-type what I already typed. I think I need a computer. I  hate having to work and concentrate amongst all the hundreds of other people  here at the SMF (the Smurf. I smile everytime I hear that). I wanted to buy a computer, and I do have the money since I sold my motorcycle, not by my own  choice, but by my mothers. I realize that was a run-on sentence, but I'm not  about to go back and fix it. I wonder if anyone is actually going to read this or not. I'm just glad that I haven't had any demented thoughts since I have  started typing. Not that I have those often, but we all have certain weird  thoughts that we really don't care to admit having. At least, I hope so. I  bet whoever reads this is going to think that I'm a bad person. I'm really not. I like to think of myself as daring and thrill seeking. My mother likes to  think of me as unconventional and improper and borderline ignorant. So, here I am at UT to prove her wrong. I've taken a step in the right direction by joining a sorority. I think that should be fun as long as I can stay on the  good side of the girls in the sorority. It has been my experience that after  anyone has known me for a long enough period of time, they grow tired of my companionship and toss me aside like yesterday's trash. This is one of the most confusing and hurtful things in my life. I don't understand it. I think I'm  the nicest person that I know. I'm always willing to do things for others to  make them happy. I'm a great listener, and I put everything I've got into  everything that I do (friendships especially). I've been told that things will  change and that things will get better in college. So far, I've found that to  be very true. I've met so many wonderful people that I can't wait to know  better, but the first 18 years of my life has me trained to wonder how long it will be before they drop me. Oh well. my twenty minutes is almost over with and I have successfully typed myself into a foul mood. I really hope  no one reads this. I'm going to leave the Smurf, go back to Castilian and  enjoy being with my new friends while they still like me!    ",0
678,"Right now I'm feeling kind of stressed about school. economics especially. I'm really not enjoying that class. it is difficult and I haven't met anyone in the class I can ask for help. the only reason I'm taking this class is because I want to transfer to the business school. and if I don't like economics I'm wondering if all this work I'm doing is worth it. am I going to work really hard in economics all year, get into the business school and then realize I don't even like business?  I sure hope not. the reason I chose business is because I like math and I like english but I don't want to major in just math or english and business seemed to be the right combination of both. I've also thought about opening my own gymnastics or cheerleading gym when I grow up and business would really help me do that. I just hope what I'm doing right now will pay off for something in the end. I'm also torn as to wether I want to try out for the diving team. I dove in high school part time and I thought I would give it a try in college. I really wanted to cheer for texas and I tried out but didn't make it so diving is the next best thing. I don't know though if I should concentrate on cheerleading and join an allstar squad and then tryout again next year or if I should give diving a shot to be involved with an organization at ut. I thought I was going to be happy with diving but now that school has started I'm not so sure anymore. I am really enjoying myself right now without diving. I have some free time, I'm not stressed cause I have a lot to do all the time like in high school but I wonder if diving will make me more stressed and I worry I won't have enough time to study and my grades will fall. it is really important to me to make good grades right now. I am worried I am going to get to my first test and not know anything. I feel like I'm studying right now and doing all my homework and so forth but I don't know if when it comes down to it if I'm really going to konw the information. I think I'm just nervous about taking a college test. I don't know what to expect and I think after my first test I wll be ok with everything. its just what I don't know is what makes me nervous. ",1
440,"Very rarely do I  just sit down in front of a blank screen and start writing without having any idea where my words are going. At this point, I'm really wishing that I could get some peace and quiet. I've always lived in an extremely quiet house and I guess I took the peacefulness for granted. However, despite the occasional clash between my study and the party in my room, I have no complaints about the present state of my life. I'm heading home this weekend, and while I've only been in Austin for about two weeks, I feel like this is home now. My house is just like some place I visit on occasion. I can't decide whether its a good thing that this change in my life doesn't bother me or whether its a bad thing. Either way. what are you going to do. I am just completely blanking on what to write about. Anything that is running through my mind would take too long to explain and I don't usually tell stories about myself anyway. For an arbitrary subject, I guess I'll write about my best friend. She goes to A&M and I will be seeing her in about a week for her sister's wedding. It seems strange to be her without her. We talked everyday in highschool. Four years. that's a long time. However, I don't feel like our relationship has suffered at all because of the distance. I always believed that once you got to see what is inside the center the someone, what makes them tick, what makes them unique, then the relationship never ends. Because, what is inside someone never changes. All of the stuff we put on for show, that changes, but not what's inside people. I am looking forward to the wedding though, because it feels like I haven't seen her in a long time.    O. K. Second arbitrary topic. Dating. I am really looking forward to dating  in college. I mean there are about 25000 new girls wandering around here, and at least some of them are bound to be interesting. However, it is a bit strange to think about dating because its only about month since I broke up with my last highschool girlfriend. Damn, it is so hot in this room. Well, my ex-girlfriend. that subject is going no where. I guess I have a tough time talking about the past. I always figured that everyone distorts there versions of the past. Memories are either viewed through rose-colored glasses or blinders. I'd rather think about what I'm doing right now. Memories are nice on occasion, but as with anything else, you can over-indulge in them. What's really foremost in my mind right now is making good grades and not losing my social life or mind in the process. I really don't think that will be too difficult though. When you study something you enjoy, then its not really work. Instead of draining your energy, it gives you more energy. New things to learn, new things to strive for. I love it. I really have no clue how long I've been writing, but I assume I'm pretty close to 20 minutes. Mental note to self:  pick up new Pat Green CD for dad tomorrow and call Angela. Well, this is my stream of consciousness. Its not a deep stream but damn it its mine. To end I will remind myself of some sayings a very wise man said once:  Never play poker with a man named Doc. Never eat at a place called Mom's. Never date a woman with a tattoo of a dagger anywhere on her body. Never try to teach a pig to sing. it stresses you out and annoys the pig, and finally, the ultimate truth in the universe:  frogs have and always will whomp their asses every time they jump. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Be sure to tip your waitress. Good Night!      ",1
211,"I am feeling kind of nervous today because I only have one class and I am supposed to spend the rest of the day at the fraternity house doing chores. I also wonder why I have to do these chores, because all of the actives had to do them when they were pledges?  In any event I know that I have to go over there and it will not be fun. I am also excited because next week my parents are going to come in town and it will be the first time I have physically seen them since I moved down here. Also my cousin is going to be coming down here to visit UT and I am excited that I will be able to see her. People told me that I would be overwhelmed when I came down here but I haven't felt that way yet. Things are getting harder by the week, but I think I am handling it well. My room is a mess and I really need to clean it up and do the laundry. I guess I will today since I will have maybe a little free time. ",1
1561,"   Today is September 10, the day before our new monumental rememberence day of September 11th. I sometimes wonder if tomorrow there will be another attack on the United States. It is weird to think that anything could happen tomorrow and we can't do anything about it. I still remember like it was yesterday watching the September 11th terrorist attack not knowing what will happen to the United STates. I really hope that we can prevent anything from happening tomorrow.        Now that I am a freshman at the University of Texas things are beginging to change. For instance, my boyfriend and I are on a   break  , whatever that means. He doesn't like me only seeing him when it is convinient for me to hang out. He's a junior at St. Edwards University and has done the whole new college experience already. It is hard for him to not see me as much as this summer. I think it is that I really want to go out and meet new people. Getting to know the girls at my dorm in Kinsolving is really fun, and I like hanging out with them on the weekends. Of course this means going to parties with other boys there, and this doesn't make my boyfriend very happy. I can totally understand because I wouldnt want him to hang out with all girls at a party, but I have to do the whole college experience right?  Well anyway now that we are broken up, I realize how much I miss him and how much I don't want to end things. It's weird how when it's time to go to sleep or study that is all I can think about. He's so cute and perfect, I don't know what I am screwing up. It's hard trying to balance your time here now that I am in college. There is always something to do, and I love that, but I need to concentrate on studying and keeping myself on track. I guess in high school that courses could be made not as difficult, and deadlines were not so final, as long as you could persuade the teacher. College is a blast and I love my roomate. She went to high school with me until our junior year when she moved to Baton Rouge. She still came down lots during the last two years of high school to visit her old friends every chance she could. So then she made the right choice and came to UT and we ended up rooming together. It's really fun because last night we decided we wanted to work out at the gym downstairs to take a break from studying and went to kinsolvings gym for an hour from 1 in the morning to 2 in the morning. I really need to go to the gym today also because I don't want to gain the freshman 15, I reallly don't want to go back home to Lake Jackson looking like a heffer!  So anyway I think I might go run after I finish writing. Another hard thing about being off at school is that my best friend in the world is not here. She got in to the summer UT program but decided to go to LSU instead. I miss her so much, we spent every second toghther this summer and are so close. OUr boyfriends are best friends so the four of us hung out all the time. Me and my boyfriend were responsible for hooking them up, so we could all hang out and it worked perfectly. Except now we're having problems and we're in the same town. My friend and her boyfriend are 8 hours away and doing great, funny how that works. One good thing about going to school here in austin is that it is so pretty. I love the hills and trees. OUtside my dorm room window is hills and churches. Yes, it is hot here but it doesnt have the humididty that we had back home. Another good thing about living here is that my older sister that is 21 goes to SWT so is only like 30 minutes away from me. We have always been so close and I miss her lots. I went down on Laybor day with 3 of my friends to go float the river with her and her sorority sisters. It was really fun and I got to spend time with her. My mom is sad that I left for college, she wanted me to stay at home for the first year and go to a jr college. I really wanted to get out on my own and not have to stay at home and be left behind. All of my friends were leaving for school and I really didnt wnat to be the only one at home. I am one out of four kids at home. MY older sister is already off at SWT, but then I have a 15 year old brother and a 11 year old sister. I don't think it is the same at home without me. My mom and I  are really close, and I talk to her almost everyday. She said it's very quiet without me at home, I guess I was always the busy one and needing to do stuff and rush around. Even though not being at home is very weird, I love college. The freedom you have is great. I know that I have to concentrate on my classes lots because I want to get into the communications school here at UT&gt; ",0
1560,"     The room seems to be nice and cool, much better than the heat outside. I should keep in mind that in thirty minutes or so I will go to a study group. I'm kind of hungry, i don't know what I should get for dinner today. Should I go for sushi or pasta, why am I so indecisive?  I wonder what my friends are doing right now. I hate it when I don't know what to write, or when I have a blank moment. I should remember to check if there are any conflicting exam times with my biology class exam. What is it that makes people tick?  As soon as I find the time to, I'm going to read Lord of The Rings. Maybe i shouldn't get sushi because its too expensive, but its also so good. There goes my indecisiveness again. I wonder which song I should listen to next, what am I in the mood for. This song sounds good, I guess I'll stick with this one for a while until I get bored of it. Is there any other homework left, I hate it whenever I get the feeling that I'm forgetting something but can't seem to find out what. It might be a good idea to do laundry this weekend, but i'll probably get lazy again, must remind myself not to be lazy. Maybe I should call my study partner that I might be late in coming because of thi essay. I'll turn around for a while and see what my roommate is watching on TV. I wonder if the music that I'm playing bugs my roommate or not. The TV show thats on right now seems pretty funny. I've never had Mountain Dew: Code Red before, maybe I should try it sometime, that is as soon as they restock the coke machines in my dorm. What is the point of life? All we do is try to become someone who has a purpose in society, and then in the end it doesn't even matter cause we all eventually die. I wonder what it would be like if I could be immortal. Many seems to think that being immortal is a curse cause you'll go through a lot of pain and it'll never end, I on the other hand find it interesting. I hope I can get a high GPA and keep it, it would really be nice if something academic turned out perfectly the way I wanted it to. I still kind of mad at the chemistry online homework, how could I be so stupid as to make such stupid mistakes. Oh well I can make it up on the next homework. I better do good on the exam, cause this is supposed to be easy for me since I've done it all already.   ",1
430,"I have tried on three different occasions to do my pretesting for this class and the stupid computer tells me to try again later. why should I try again later. I'm already going out of my way to come down here in the first place. my dad hasnt brought up my computer from home yet so I have to come down here when I need to get online to check my email or whatever I have to do for class. it seems that everything is done by computers these days. take this class for instance, I am handing in my writing assignment via some electronic force. I'm not actually handing in paper anymore. its all done so technically and confusingly. have I mentioned I absolutely hate computers? its not that I don't think theyre useful, its just that I'm not exactly copmuter friendly. well actually, I'm willing to be its friend, I just don't think it likes me too much. at home the only thing I knew how to do was check my email and write people back. oh yea, I also knew how to get to microsoft word and to solitaire, but that's about it. here there are so many options on what I can do, but don't they understand that by giving me all these options, theyre really doing me harm instead of being helpful. whoever made up computers must be very smart. sometimes I think about the things (technologies) that we live with and do in our every day lives, and it just boggles my mind. how in the world did that guy--I forget his name--- come up with a device called the telephone. I mean to even dream up of it and then to actually make it work. sound travelling through wires--- this is a crazy world. if the world had been populated with people with about as much intelligence as me, I know for a fact that we would be the most uncivilized dummy-heads roaming the earth. sometimes I wonder what the world would be like if there were none of these technologies. I don't think technologies is neccesarily such a bad, currupting thing. I mean, it is peolple who are inventing it. it doesn't come about on its own. like you know how some people think tv is so terrible, or those religions who don't allow light bulbs or radios in their homes because its like the devils advocate or whatever-- I don't see how some people believe the things that they do. I mean, wake up and think for yourself. who am I to talk, I'm not all perfect in the catagory of thinking for myself, but I probaly have a better sense of things than a lot of other people--or maybe not. life is confusing. that's probably why I'm taking comparitive value, contemporary moral problems, and psychology. can't wait to get to know myself better.

2246,"twenty seconds and I still haven't thought of anything. Jennifer is crazy for taking all those chemistry classes! I couldn't even work on my math problems, and concentrate. I don't know how she makes it all those hours with science and math. We're going to watch that movie tonight, in a little while, so I need to finish my homework pretty soon, and get a head start on the week, so I don't have too much to worry about. I need stop freaking out the ghost in our community bathroom! Those shower curtains don't open themselves! I wonder is molly is going to be happy for me and jen about being the new wing representatives? wow that's a big word. I wonder if that's how you spell it. I need to clean up my room before my roommate throws my stuff out in the hall. Stupid jose can't really mean what he said. He said he's not IN love with me, and just loves me. But I know we'll get back together. I'm sure of that. Now. . Whhooooahhhh I clicked that button too many times. I really hope they don't run out of the poster I want. I signed up to work for 5 hours at the poster sales to get $50 worth of credit for that poster starry night. wow that hairstyle's weird. That guy must work hard to get it like that. maybe I should stop looking out the door. it's too quiet in here, since jen doesn't listen to her music out loud. I love that people miss me back home, and that makes me feel like I was someone back there. the more I look around this room, the more I like the color purple. I remember the superman theme from stucco, and the way Michael looked in his cape. I wish I had my photo album with me right now to show jen. mmmmmmmmmmuuuuuuuuuuuaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaa the eyes of Texas are upon you. . Today's lunch was super cool, because me and jen went back to the buffet, where she saw her friend who also happens to be Hispanic too! I was so glad when I saw Hispanics here. I need to add more people to my yahoo, because I only have four people. I don't know why more people here don't have messenger, like people back home. this is so cool, because it keeps you thinking, and you see it right in front of you. This is so much fun, I should do this more often and then find the pattern of what I seem to think about more often. darn! my time is already running out. this was fun. I'm down to like 15 seconds. I hope I did this assignment right. ",0
647,"It is hard to put thoughts and feelings into words. The air conditioner is blowing on me, giving me goose bumps. My stomach has felt bad all day, I took Pepto Bismol an hour ago but it hasn't seemed to help. I'm tired, and it's only 10:00. This house is always so messy, I wish Bryan would help me keep it clean. I'm going to start doing better. The picture of Deban on my desk is so bad, she would die if she saw it. What am I going to wear tomorrow?  I don't want to have to wake up early. I have to wake up at 9, I guess that isn't that early. I had so much fun at my family reunion. I miss my family even though I just saw them 2 days ago. Some woman on the TV was trying to kill her kid, Kathy Bush wanted to kill her daughter?  The news is so horrible. It's rediculous what goes on in our country every day. I think more people should be executed. The government spends way too much money on keeping people in jail and on death row. If someone is found guilty for intentjionally killing someone or trying to should be executed then and there, saving lots of people time and money, and making a point to the general public. I can't wait until Christmas. I already know what I'm going to get Bryan and my mom, and my dad. We're going to get my dad a 56 K modem. He's wanted one for a long time. What a boring gift, he is such a boring guy. OH well. I don't want to type for 12 more minutes. I think this assignment is stupid. I don't see the point. Or maybe there is  a point, but I'm not helping because I'm doing it wrong. What does it matter, is anyone really going to read this?  I feel sorry for the person who has to read all of these things. Oh good, I didn't want Bryan to come over and read this, he left the living room. Our apartment is pretty smalll but I resally like living in austin. Finally, he's going to take out the trash. Only one little responsiblity and he hardly can take care of it. Oh that made a lot of sense. some guy on the news is getting 60 years for molesting a child. What makes me sick is all the women killing their babies. I think pretty much all of those women should be executed, its rediculous how little our society cares about little babies. They are people too they shouldn't be murdered because of their stupid mothers. I think that if those mothers wouoold be punished more severely, there would be less instances of mothers killing babies. I hate democrats. I hate Bill Clinton. I will be so glad when he is no longer our president. I hope Bush runs next year, I know he'll win and our country will be in much better hands. 7 more minutes of typing stuff noone will ever read. tomorrow is wednesday, that means church and 7:30. So should I go to the trig review class or should I go to church?  I think I'll end up leaving early from class so I can make it to church. I need to get my priorities straight. It's hard to make yourself go when you know you don't have to, and no one wouold ever know. I want to save peolpe from going to Hell, like where mosdt of the world is headed. Now I'm glad no one will read this because it soulnds like I""m some crazy conservative person. Narrow is the road to salvation, wide the road to destruction. The bible says loud and clear that more people will go to Hell than Heaven. ",0
387,Tony just walked into our apartment and Ashley is asleep. Maybe I need to work on some other stuff. This pre-testing page is down. it keeps shutting down every time I try to use it. I wonder why I even try sometimes. Why am I doing all this stuff enter night. into night  grain of sand. off to never-never land. I just typed Metallica lyrics. I don't even like Metallica   this is kind of weird. I don't think that I can keep doing this for 20 minutes. Ashley's starting to wake up now. at least most of my studies are done because I'm going to play Broomball later tonight. Do I play at Trees or not?  I just think that it will be too hard to actually get to Dallas in time to do it. I can't relax enough to do stream of consciousness. I'm completely aware of everything I'm typing even though it's not selective. boy Tony is loud. Ashley's so cute when she's sleeping. she's starting to wake up. oh wow. I can see her underwear. she'd be a bit embarrassed. she's up know. and gave me a big smile.        now she's laughing at me. now she's trying to talk to me and distract me from my work. going on for twenty minutes?   My word. I don't have time for this. I think I have the Psychology department figured out but I think they just have everybody take these intro psyche classes so they can get info for their own experiments. they just make it look like a class so they have a bunch of subjects. a cigar. I could use one right now. I'm so stressed out. I'm tired of that bare naked Ladies song. Zach is talking to me right now. what a moron he is. . just about random stuff. . yes go on. exchange the genesis for mario kart. that's a good idea. we're getting mario kart. .

1896,"   Okay i really do not know what to say frankly i have never done a writing assignment not knowing what the topic is or what ia m expected to write but all i know is that i have to write or type for the next twenty minutes which for me seems like it is fairly a small amount of time since i type really slow. Anyway since i get tto ventilate myself i will tell you that i like the class, no i am not trying to get some extra points though that would be nice. I love psych, i actually want to be an elementary counselor, i guess i choose this because my parents split up and i guess i want to help students or young kids to understand this whole mess. it really does not matter anymore although to be frank i wish things were the way the were before, not for me but for my younger sister she has suffered a lot from the desicion my parents made, well actually my mother, but who is to blame, I guess that is all in the past and i can't change that. well enough of that i am really glad that we can just type and type just letting our little heads just take us somewhere i reall appreciate this since i am not worried about how this will be graded i think i just have a little anxiety when it comes to papers, i guess i have to get into the idea that college is totally different form high school. i think my problem is that i know that everyone is expecting a lot from me since i am the first in the family to attend a big university, both in my dads family and in my immediate family. i am afraid of letting them down sometimes i really can't take it but i just know that everyone is behnd me i guess that motivates me and at the same time that kind of puts a bunch of pressure on my shoulders. i guess it is because my brother is or should be like a junior but i frankly think that he is just being a drain in the economy, i mean i probably saw him studying once in a whole semester and that was probably just cramming for his final exams. right now i really do not know whta ha plans on doing he just simply needs to get his act together not that i always do but at least i know that i won't hurt my parents the way he does. I guess that i am not being the perfect daughter either if my mom only knew that her little innocent daughter moved in with her boyfriend when she moved to austin. She would just so die she would never think that i lied to her telling her that i would be living alone. i really feel guilty do not get me wrong but what can i do if she would have opened herself a little towards me then i would have probably told her, who am i trying to kid i guess that is just my excuse i have asked my mom several times already if she would let me get married and she said no, well she said wait at least two yeras i really do not knowhy i need to wait two years, she says that has nothing to do with my boyfriend which is true they get along real good i really do not know if it is that he speaks spanish or if it is the fact that he is real nice, oh did i mention that he gets paid really good. I do not know i just hope that my mom doen not get that mad, i hope she understands a little. i guess that for now i just need to enjoy myself until my mom finds out what is going on. when she doe i know things are going to blow up she will tell my dad, and i really do not want him to find out yet, you see my dad is depressed, the whole divorce thing i mentioned earlier, and he says i am like his friend he says that i am the only person he can talk to just about anything i think that when he finds out his whole world will just fall apart even more than it is already. i am just trying to make the best out of my life i am happy withn the way it is going and i really do not care if they do  not agree with the way i am living it. as long as i get my stuff done they should not worry about me, i hate when people say don't get married because then you won't go back to school i will prove all them wrong i will teach them, i know that you can do anything you want when you put your mind to it ",0
1886,"     My nose is really stuffy right now and I had a fever earlier today but I think it's gone now. I hate not being able to breathe. I can hear the television right now. There's a commercial about honey barbecue wings. I can also hear my room mate typing and clicking her mouse. It's really cold in my room. I'm glad I decided to put my sweater on or I would be extremely cold. I can't really smell anything because of my stuffy nose. My stomach is growling. I have a craving for pizza. Maybe I'll go get some as soon as I finish this assignment. My room mate seems to be frustrated right now. I just heard her sigh. She has a test tomorrow that she needs to study for. She is mad because we weren't able to get football tickets for the OU game in Dallas. I kind of wanted to go and was getting excited about going to it. The television just mentioned something about getting pizza. Now my craving for it is increasing. I can taste it now. It's hard to type for 20 minutes straight. The phone just started ringing and distracted my train of thought for a while. My room mate just left the room to go open the door. I can watch the television from where I am sitting in front of my computer. My room mate's brother just walked in. Now all I can think about is what he is saying and I can't arrange my thoughts now. I just gave my room mate's brother my graphing calculator and showed him how to use it. I can't think of what to type any more. I am quickly running out of ideas. Time is passing really slowly. Typing for 20 minutes is really hard. My room mate is still talking about the OU football tickets. She is getting rid of her wristband and now I am thinking how I need to take mine off too. What other homework do I have?  I don't feel like going to my calculus class tomorrow. It is the most boring class I have because all we do is work out problems. I should go to the discussion session today, but I would rather go shopping with my friend. I keep sniffing. I still wish I could breathe. I think that not being able to breathe is the most annoying thing in the world. I feel as though I want to chop off my nose just so I don't have to feel congested any longer. Is this feeling normal?  Wanting to chop off my nose?  Everytime I get congested I feel the exact same way. Now I am starting to think that there is something wrong with me for wanting to chop off my nose. Oh well, I bet it is a perfectly normal feeling when you are sick and frustrated. I wonder what caused me to become congested. I heard that a lot of people have been sick today. Maybe something is going around. I always get sick. I have the worst immune system. My stomach keeps growling, but I am not sure if I want to eat because I feel as though I shouldn't eat because I want to lose weight although all my friends say that I am crazy for feeling this way. They keep telling me that I am perfectly fine the way I am. I still don't believe them because they don't see what I see in the mirror everyday. I've been told that I have a contorted way of looking at myself and that when I look in the mirror I see something different from what everyone else sees. But isn't that true for a lot of people?  Don't a lot of people see themselves in the mirror and not like what they see?  I think that it is perfectly normal to feel this way. What isn't normal though is acting upon it. Oh well. I can still hear the television and sometimes it distracts my thoughts because I begin to pay more attention to what is on the tv rather than my own thoughts. Now I want goldfish because I just heard the commercial. I can't think of what to type again. I think that this assignment causes us to think too much about what to type and that it puts us on the spot so that we freeze up and are no longer able to type what we think because we keep trying to type interesting things and not simply what is really on our minds. My room mate just laughed. I wonder why she laughed. I can hear the people out in the hallway. These walls are really thin because I can always hear what is going on outside. The refrigerator noise is really annoying. It's so loud. I feel sick still. I just want to go lay in my bed and sleep forever. I never get enough sleep. I always end up staying up really late and then I feel dead in the morning. My foot is falling asleep as well as my hands. I have the worst circulation in the world. Why is it that my feet and hands are constantly falling asleep no matter what position I put them in. I think it has to do with the fact that I don't get the proper nutrients. My hands are starting to get tired now. I can't wait until I am finished typing. I have about 2 minutes left and actually it wasn't really that hard to type for 20 minutes consecutively. I wonder how long everyone else's writing assingments are. I bet some of them will be longer than mine because a lot of people can type faster than I can. Oh well so much for that because it's too late now to start typing faster. I could try but then it would just seem pointless. My contacts are getting dry and it's getting hard to see the screen. I hate sitting at my desk and now my arms are starting to hurt because they are in a weird position. I am almost finished now and almost time to stop. The window just appeared saying that I am finished now and I can stop typing. ",1
324,"Ok. Here we go. Well I really don't have much to say right now. I've done this type of writing before. It was a strange experience. All I ended up writing was the lyrics to some song I couldn't get out of my head. I just kept going over and over again. Don't you hate that?  I especially hate it when it's like some obnoxious song that I only know the chorus to or something. Hmmm. Right now IÃ¯Â¿Â½m wondering how in the world IÃ¯Â¿Â½m supposed to keep on typing for twenty minutes and keep on coming up with things to say. It's kind of like when you meet someone new and you're trying to have a conversation with them and you keep hitting those brick walls. I constantly do that. You can only ask a person their major so many times. I wish I would have taken a typing class in high school. Everyone else I know did but I procrastinated so I could only take a programming class for my computer credit. But it was good that I took that class. Now IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve learned that I really do hate programming. I have to come to terms with the fact that I like computers yet I hate programming. I think my brain would slowly build up pressure and then explode when IÃ¯Â¿Â½m in my 40s if I became a programmer. My typing skills are atrocious!  I think IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve been out of practice. I wonder what Agnes is doing?  She's my roommate and she's sitting next to me. She always gets a lot of e-mail, yet she complains regularly that no one writes her. I like get nothing but that could be because I don't write anyone either. Oh well. I think if I got into the e-mail habit again, I would waste way too much time in the computer lab anyway. Oh no. Mind block. This is kind of like writing a letter to your closest friend. (which I also haven't done in a while. )  Just say whatever an who cares if they care or not. What are you guys going to do with this information anyway??  I missed the first day of class so I really don't know how this stuff is going to be used. I've always been afraid that if I ever went to a psychologist or something, that they would end up telling me that IÃ¯Â¿Â½m nuts or something. Or they would know something about me that I really don't want them to know. And there's a lot of that kind of stuff. Everyone in this room is staring blankly into the screen of their computers. Isn't it amazing the power these little boxes of silicon and metal have over us?  Imagine our world today without computers. (apparently I actually learned something from my comp sci class here)  If one day all computers just stopped working, we would all be screwed. The world would go haywire. I would go nuts. And don't limit it to the computer in the traditional sense. We're talking the little computer chip in your remote control or in your light fixtures. Everything. Hey. that would make a good story. I bet it's been done before but I think I just inspired myself. That'll be my second movie. Did I say I wanted to be a director?  Well I do. Now I have three ideas for my first films. I really can't wait. I need to go out and buy some books. I've been running out of things to read. I love books. Actually I have a new favorite author. Jeff Noon. That reminds me I need to look him up on the web. I wonder if he's written anything else??  I hope so. ""Vurt""  was one of the best books IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve ever read. Well, times up. :) ",0
841,"I am so excited about being down at UT but now I realize what everyone meant when they said that it is hard to study at UT. I have been out every night this week because there is so much going on. Luckily, I have still kept up with my school work and have been to every class. This week is the only week that I am going to go out every night but I have just had so much fun. There is a guy that I met when I came down here my junior year in high school and we completely hit it off. I am looking forward to seeing him again. I absolutely love the classes that I am taking right now. It is refreshing to go to a class where the students and professors are excited to be there and excited to learn. The material has been interesting and I can't wait to get started in my business honors classes. I am having some roommate problems right now, though. One of my roommates is incredibly messy, stays out all night every night and gets very drunk. I need to talk to her about this problem before it gets too big so maybe I will take her to lunch this weekend. Saturday at the game I get to sit in a box and I am so excited. The last game was fun but it was at night and I was burning up so I can only imagine how an afternoon game would be. Thankfully I will be in air conditioned rooms with free food and drinks. I really like the guy I am going with. Not as a boyfriend but as a really good friend. He is a gentleman and really looks out for me. Last night I met this really cute guy and he kissed me but I found out this morning that he has a serious girlfriend that goes to TCU- what a jerk! I am very mad that he put me in this awkward position. I thought he was so nice and such a gentleman last night but that just goes to show you. You really can not trust freshmen guys- they are only after one thing. I am still getting adjusted to college life and it does take some adjusting. I really do miss my mom and my house. The food at Hardin House is so gross and I hate to eat it. I know that I am going to gain the freshman fifteen. This year is my sisters debutante season and when I go home I am going to have to go to tons of parties and everyone is going to notice that I ahve gained weight and they will all be looking for it. But I have been working out everyday and trying to watch what I eat but there is always candy and good food sitting out around the rooms and I always end up grabbing a handful. But, life is short. Right now I am going to finish this writing and then I am going to study some Spanish and try to start reading Psychology. I am really mad that I am going to miss the first exam but thankfully I will be able to make it up. I am probably going to be missing a lot of class this semester because of traveling. I almost wish I was giving up my title this fall but it isn't until the summer when I give it up. I have enjoyed everything that I have gotten to do and see since I have been Miss Teen of America and all of the opportunities but with going to college and going through rush it has been very overwhelming. I would like to run for President of my pledge class, that would be a great way to get involved in my sorority and to really get to know all of my pledge sisters. I would love to be President of Pi Phi someday just because it is great to be in all sorts of different organizations and be really involved. I haven't gotten involved in anything at UT yet and I am keeping my eyes open for any news about interesting groups and clubs. My neck hurts today and I think it is from carrying my backpack all around. I had to take a bunch of my books back to the Co-op the other day so I got to lug the around. NOT FUN! UT is such a huge school and every little errand takes forever. My sister went here her freshman year and didn't like it so she transfered to TCU, but I love it at UT. I just really feel at home in Austin and I enjoy the diversity of all the people. It really teaches you to be open-minded and not so quick to judge. Coming from Midland, it is a great lesson to learn that people who are not straigt-edge conservative have a lot to offer and teach you, too. Well, the twenty minutes is almost up- that went by really fast. I guess I will go and dry my hair and then get to my reading. ",1
1387,"So, write for twenty minutes that should be easy enough. The concert last night was great I have never seen anyone play like that especially for that length of time. I mean goodness they played for three and a half hours. Victor is great I would have put incredible but I don't know how to spell it. I am kind of glad that I get to go home today. I mean I like Austin and all, but it's good to get home every once and a while. I'm also glad that Brandon got to come down for a couple of days, He was probably pretty glad to get out of Dallas for a while I can't believe this word processor doesn't have the word Dallas programmed in the spell checker. Some people. At least the ones responsible for the computers that is. Oh well. I wonder what everyone else is writing. I imagine that this could turn into some sort of confessional for some people. Weird. Read any good books? I haven't lately only newspapers and those don't count. I am excited about going to Berkeley next year. Not Berkley California, Berkeley Boston. Lots of good musicians there. Of course there are lots of good musicians here too, just of a different kind of breed everything here is about the blues while in the Northeast people look at things a little differently. Commercials on TV suck. I don't understand the ones that come on during prime time and then they say absolutely nothing about what it is they are selling or any relevant information about the products. Create interest nothing. creates confusion. Do theses people honestly think that the majority of Americans even give a shit about commercials much less THEIR product. Besides most of them are about disgusting stuff in the first place. Women's hygiene ads and balding men paraphernalia. Who cares people with those kind of problems would obviously know that they had a problem and most of them are seeking a solution so it seems to me that if you just shut up and spent your ad money making the best product on the market then people would buy it because it was the best. Not because Barbra on TV said that eight out of ten doctors seem to think that somewhere sometime this product might be exactly what you might be looking for. Well my time is done so I guess this is the end ",1
208,"I just wasted over an hour and a half trying to get my stupid Ethernet card to work. the worst part is that I waited over four weeks for this stupid thing to come in and now none of the drivers and software recognize it. I think it is  royally <blank>. now I have to waste another two hours talking to technical  support so they can take the thing back. what a rip. this makes this day a  really big let down, considering I complained to my parents about getting this  thing up here for me. I could have been doing some of the hundreds of hours of  homework that I have to do. this day has been really wasted. every day is a  waste. all I do is homework each day and nothing more or less. occasionally I get to watch half an hour of television or go to the union or go play a few  video games, but lately, it seems that every class wants me to spend a few hours each night working on their assignments. I haven't even had time to look around the Austin area. I haven't seen a movie in a while either. this place  really sucks. I don't do anything really interesting. I have no life. now IÃ¯Â¿Â½m complaining too much AND being self-conscious. I couldn't even read my notes on that example. he talks too fast for people to keep up. psychology sounds pretty cool. the breeze never hits Austin. it's like it is always hot and the sun never goes away. maybe one day it will turn into fall in this town and finally it's  be relatively cool so I don't marinate in my own juices. yeah, I know it sounds gross, but what would you call it? I take a shower, walk to Kinsolving, when I  get there, IÃ¯Â¿Â½m tired and need to take a shower, and I sure do work up an appetite. it's the way back that is a killer. by the time you get back to Moore hill, you feel like rolling over and dying because of your full stomach, the  supersaturated shirt and the fatigued feet. I need to jog more. it seems like  IÃ¯Â¿Â½ll never have time. I never have time to do any of my old hobbies. for crying out loud, I can't even get y network card to install onto my notebook. I wish I had time to do my old hobbies, like photography. I could have and should have majored in photography. maybe I should major is psychology. it's a really  interesting class and I kind of like it I wish they served more than three flavors of ice-cream. it's like that chicken. 'today for dinner, roasted chicken. for lunch it'll be chicken dumplings, tomorrow it'll be chicken soup. then  creamy chicken blank. tomorrow it is chicken patties, the next day it is chicken nuggets, the next day they'll run out of chicken and serve chicken fried steak with chicken gravy for the steak and mashed potatoes' it's repulsive what they serve us. maybe I should reduce my meal plan. better check in the morning. I  still have another few minutes. my roommate is asking about cyanide. I guess  thatÃ¯Â¿Â½s what happens when your girlfriend dumps you. tough break. he's been really depressed. he's been like this all evening. I wonder what IÃ¯Â¿Â½ll do tomorrow. I better get a plan together for what needs to be done. hmmm. I wish I could  get my net access. now IÃ¯Â¿Â½m pissed. ",0
1109,"I'm sitting all stressed out. For the first time since if got to UT I've had to study and do homework for a large period of time. I guess for the first time since I've gotten here I'm starting to realize how much work its going to take. The fraternity stage is getting old. They don't tell you that you are going to be busy about everyday of the week doing sometimes pointless stuff. I'm new to the fraternity scene and already I'm feeling somewhat burned out. And paying a lot of money to clean the frat bathrooms isn't my idea of fun anyway. Even drinking is getting old. Its almost to the point that you can expect to get messed up every night and that takes the fun out of the whole thing. I don't like admitting this to myself but it would be nice to see someone from the family right now. I'm not homesick just kind of feel like I'm missing out on everything that's going on in my brothers and parents life. It's hard to deal with the fact that the family life is never going to be the same again which is somewhat of a relief but also a little scary. At least I am enjoying living with my roommates. They were my friends before I came here but I am a bit surprised to how good we are getting along. With my friend dying last week I found myself today thinking I saw him in other people. The reality of death has hardly set in on me. His picture of him alive is hanging right in front of me, but its hard to comprehend there is no more life in him. I almost feel like all my experiences with him were pointless because he is dead. Even seeing him in an open casket I failed to connect him laying there to his death. I attribute this to the fact that this is the first person in my life that I was close to that has died. It's weird but it will help me in the future to deal with the harshness of death. More than ever I think along the lines of life after death. I'm firm in my beliefs regarding the subject but I somewhat question what its really like. I guess you never take death seriously until it effects you on the personal level. I hear of people dying everyday but it has never registered to me how important everyone's life his to someone else out there. And above all I guess the possibility of death seems more likely. I feel less likely to put myself in situations where my life is on the line. ",1
464,"Today I had a very fun (sarcastic) schedule, I worked out and also participated in my NROTC drill team, which I am a part of. My thoughts are nothing but satisfaction, a vigorous week of PT (physical training), academics, drill, and discipline have finally ended for three glorious days to elapse. Yes, just another three days or so, then it's back to the normal vigorous routine. My feelings for joining the NROTC unit is my decision, the option to choose the path to become a Marine Corps commissioned officer is brave for my part. For the past week, PT has been vigorous and I sometimes find myself out of shape for the activities. My ankle, which has a long history of spraining, is not helping either. My Gunnery Sergeant and my Staff Sergeant and I agreed that the Leathernecks, the ""Marine Corps"" part of the team, will help me get up to standards, after all, the Leathernecks and the entire unit looks after its own. Looks after it's own. I want to be part of the team, a part of the unit, a player, a leader, not a manager, not a weakling, nor any of that. I want to prove that I am someone. That I am a human being, someone worthy of being respected and liked. I have had a couple of bad experiences before I reported to UT. One was that I broke up with my girlfriend for the summer. She and I, even though we liked each other, found out that we were 'incompatible' and the separation of college (me going to UT, she going to U of H) would only make things worse. Sometimes we would find ourselves arguing over something as petty as 'who left the door open?'. It was a bad experience and the breakup just before college hit me like a MACK truck, just like all my bad experiences before. After my breakup, I wonder whether I should date again. There's a nice girl (I won't name her name or how I know her) around that I know but I don't know if I should get to know her more. Maybe it's because I had a bad history of dating, and I sometimes wonder if I would take the circle path back to where I started, broken up and feeling depressed about myself. This girl, I like her a lot, and I  think she thinks I'm ok, but I don't know if she really likes me. To take another risk like that will probably leave me either being shunned my rejection or being depressed by another break up. That's why I must concentrate on other things. My priority is to the team, and I will work as much as I can to get my unit up and running. I am in the pistol and the drill team and I want to learn more and know more. Also, I want to get a 4. 0 GPA, so I can get a scholarship from my unit. PT has been tough, I find myself being killed by the active duty Marines when we PT, but I can't quit. My ankle had me forced to drop out of the runs two times, but I won't quit the program. I cannot quit, and I will not quit. To quit will put me forever in disgrace as a quitter who couldn't 'hack it' and also in the shun of my teammates, who I left them high and dry by letting them down. To quit would also to put me down further into the downward spiral of depression. To quit is out of the question. I will keep on going no matter what happens and I will do anything that has to be done to pass. I will not fail.                 ",1
742,"I am very famished right now. I just got back from the psychology class. My stomach is gnawing, and I feel the grinding emotions. I haven't been very energetic the whole day. I almost fell asleep in my calculus class today. This is terrible, because I have never really gotten that tired in high school before. It always just seemed to be the calculus class that I almost fall asleep in. I am very frustrated at school. It is not only that I am a freshman, and that I am still trying to adjust to college life, but it is also due to my classes. For example, I have a biology class, with an excellent professor. However, his teaching assistant is making me really upset, because he can't really speak english. He is Indian, and I am sure he must be very intelligent, but I cannot understand what he is saying most of the time. I understand him on that basis, because I am after all a foreign student, and 4 years of high school have really changed my speaking capabilities. But I guess the older one gets, the harder it is for them to learn and adapt to new things. Anyway, I was vexed too, because he would not explain the questions asked by himself, but he would ask the class to input their answers. I understand that he wants the class to participate as a whole, but he can't just rely on students' answers. After all, we are just as confused. Math class is almost the same, except my math teacher speaks better than him. But Math has always been a tough area of subject for me. I have a bad history of math, and therefore I think that class is prone to my exhaustion. My professor is explaining math thoroughly, and he is very helpful and good, but my dislike for math overcomes me. I know that it is mind over matter, and that if I try to psyched myself to like math, I could probably get to put my energy into it. Don't get me wrong. I have always been a good student. I was valedictorian of my high school, and my high school is one of the best in Dallas. However, there are always some flaws even to the perfect, because no one is infallible, and I tend to procrastinate. This in the end results in my fears now. I am getting so nervous every day, because I am behind in my reading of assignments, and I am   worried that some professors are going to spring out pop-quizzes on me. I  also noticed that I not only tire so easily now, but my attention span has also increased, and my thoughts wander so much to the insignificant matter. I can't seem to concentrate reading in my room, when all the food, bed, noises, and I guess everything seems to distract me. Also, I have never been in a relationship before, not even dating, and in college, I thought it is where one may start for me. I often find myself looking out for guys. Even if I do get into one, I am sure that I will not do anything to jeopardize my future. I really want to be a doctor, and I am right now very worried about medical school. I really want to enter Harvard, and I am rather mad that they deferred me during early decision, and didn't admit me during spring decision. I guess I am being irrational here, but I did harbor the hope that I could get in because of the deferral. But that stumbling block will not trip me, I will still continue to work hard in college, get out with a 4. 0 GPA, and hopefully a high MCAT score, and hope that I can apply to Harvard and get into med school. That would be a very nice, ultimate dream that I would ever want to fulfill. I am very hungry right now, and I am having a major headache trying to think if I should double major in something, because it is not wise just to major in biology, and think that everything including medical school will be smooth for me. I think I will visit my advisor on Friday.     ",1
1298,"Starting out college life was harder than I expected. I thought leaving home and being on my own would be a fun thing, and that nothing would happen in a bad way. I guess I was wrong because it was very difficult to learning to be on my own. Now I have no parents to depend on, and I had to learn to be responsible. The first week I didn't really know many people here so it was hard finding something to do. If I had people I knew I would have placed to go to instead of doing nothing. Since there was no homework or anything this was the time to have some freedom. I was thinking that once the school year started I would have to concentrate on studying and worry about grades. I think studying is a very important thing in college life. College life is a whole lot different from high school life. One major difference is going to class. I don't know how to write that difference is in words but I know it is different from high school. It's just this feeling I have. I wonder if this feeling counts as a reason to explain the difference of the two. There's one good thing I recognized about being away from home and parents. That is more freedom! There are no parents telling you to come home at a certain time or to clean the house. Being away from is good and at the same time bad. Being away from home means being away from family. And no family means loneliness because family is family. There is also friends that you can always make and they can be like your family even they can't replace them. Friends are always good to have, but it's also important to have good friends. Friends that understand you and will be by you in times of need. I guess there are also organizations and clubs that you can join to meet new people and experience new people. Since the first time I came here I have met many new friends that I think are very nice. Meeting new people is a fun thing; therefore everyone should meet new people. One thing that is worrying me is the freshmen 15. This I heard from people that already experienced college life. Freshmen are supposedly to gain 15 pounds their first year because you have the freedom to eat whatever, whenever you want. The scary thing about that is that a person I know said girls are more likely to gain and guys are most likely to lose weight. I thought ""Dang~ why the girls!"" I hope I don't gain 15 pounds and go home hearing people say to me, ""Wow~ you gained some weight in college haven't you. "" That is something I never want to hear. ",0
1290,"I completely forgot that I had a discussion group for Philosophy today at 12, so I went out last night with the intentions of being able to sleep in all day today, but no. Luckily my roommate is in the same class and reminded me, so now I am awake. Since I have been here I have never spent the night completely alone in our room. However, this weekend I have to stay in town for some dumb sorority match and retreat, while one of my roommates goes home to Houston, one to Dallas, and the other is always at her boyfriends. So this weekend I will be sleeping here all alone, which kind of sucks. I used to always stay home alone, for weeks at a time. But it will be weird to stay here alone, since I have been here all of three weeks. Right now I am on the phone with the Health Center people, because I woke up with a swollen eye, which doesn't feel to great, so I am about to go take care of that. It is really annoying, it isn't painful, just a constant pain. Another thought on my mind lately has been one of my friends; he is also my date to the OU game in a couple of weeks. About a week ago he depledged from his fraternity cause it wasn't for him, he isn't the normal frat guy. However, the other morning when he came to pick up my ID he was wearing the outfit that they have to wear for their pledgeship. When he depledged I had a lot of respect for him because he never does things on his own, and while all his friends were pledges he wasn't. When he said he was back in it worried me. I think it is just because he is bored because none of his friends are ever there, so he is all alone. But we will see how that goes. ",1
1289,"""Today is the first day of the rest of your life"" is what I remember my parents saying to me at graduation two years ago. Back then, I was having some serious problems and nobody, including myself, knew what to do. But now, after that wild madness of that first semester in 1999 all has seemed to calm down. I don't know what it was that did it. Perhaps it was that one acid trip that I took at last year's Phish concert. Man, its annoying when that red line pops up under misspelled or misrecognizied words. Makes you feel selfcritical. I don't know how I feel now. Ever since this year began, I've been a little more tired than usual. But, I've been a little stressed out, too. Not about classes; naw, they all seem to be just fine. Enjoyable, too. Having sex with that girl Sue was a bad move, though. First of all, she's kind of nuts. I know she's lonely, too. Must be tough coming all the way from California here, but at least her family's from Texas. She's fucked up, though, because she's searching for something outside of herself that's impossible to find: security and peace of mind. It's impossible to really, really find those two things in this world I think. I mean, security's a joke; there are so many factors that we never think about in our daily lives that kind of jab at our illusions. All those things like high paying jobs, retirement funds, etc. are all about security. Personally, I think it's all a bunch of bullshit, but, then again, I'm not an old man nor do I have a family to support. I hope this girl doesn't get racked up. I'm pissed because she told me that she was on birth control, but that was a lie. And, I know that if I'd gotten some loving in the last three years I wouldn't have done it. I used her and I feel rotten for it. But, her desire for something to hold on to and peace of mind are making her irrational, I fear. Somehow, she identifies these two things with me. Don't really know why, because I never really thought of myself in those two ways realistically, but I never said there was anything rational to her thoughts. Man, I hate complaining, but I got to say that I've had some bad luck with women these last few times. First there was Lexi. I'm not really sure what was going on between the two of us, but I'm sure I loved her in some way. Can't speak from her end of the line, though. The problem was just that towards the end of last year when we were on the rocks, I was starting to go mad, and it's hard to handle a distant woman and insanity at the same time. That's kind of a lame excuse, but what else can I say? I haven't really gotten that far yet, though Lord knows I've tried. I was thinking the other day about whether or not I fear women overall. Well, I sure like to talk and think about them a lot. My mom was always such a hard ass on me growing up. I know she loved me a lot, although I hate to admit it, and I guess that's why she was. Or, maybe it was because of her upbringing. Anyway, nonetheless, I've been afraid of her forever and I'm ashamed because I think it fucks up my deal with other women and I really have a hard time deciding if I love her or not. I know it's my ""duty"" or whatever that means, but do I really? Of course I do on some level, but, man, I always get all tearyeyed when I even start thinking about it. That's another thing: I haven't been able to cry in a good, long while. Oh well, c'est la vie. My friend Elizabeth comes to mind now. I wonder how she's doing up there in NY. We have a really weird relationship, and it really hurt when I learned that she liked Matt for a long time. Guess I always had a little something for her. That was a great time up at the Doubletree last Christmas, though, I will say. Mr. A footing the entire bill, too. I guess Townes Van Zandt does have it right when he said, ""We all got holes to fill, and them holes are all that's real. "" Last night, I learned about some of Manny's holes concerning his father. He sure has been acting differently lately, though. It must be tough, but I don't know how to handle it. Maybe it's just best to let him be for a while. I kind of liked that Emily girl I met last night as well. I guess that statistic that says that men think about sex/women every 30 sec or so is right; the majority of this writing's about them. Or, maybe I just have some complex or something. Probably a combo of the two. I don't know what to think about God these days. I sure have been praying a lot to Him lately, though, over this Sue pregnancy thing. God, I hope that works out for me. I know it's selfish, but, man, You've got to understand. I truly am sorry, and I'll never have sex with another girl again on a onenighter. Lord, hear my prayer. Amen. Our society's kind of funny these days. If there is a man upstairs, I hope he's having a good time. It's amazing how fucked up stuff can get down here, though. After high school, I mean. Sometimes it's hard to be a man, and a woman I'm sure. I wonder who's got it worse. ""Sucede que me canso de ser hombre. "" It just so happens I'm tired of being a man, says Octavio Paz. I guess we all feel like that sometimes. Well, I guess my 20 minutes is up, but I do like this. Maybe we'll talk again sometime. See you, man. Take care and good luck. ",1
2231,"I am sitting in my room and I look around to see my roommate and my boyfriend. Trying to make my train of thought come to me so I can type it. All I can think about is all my boyfriend's theories about life and his many different issues. He believes in ""Boxism"", he was a little out of it when he thought of this, were everyone was born in a box which was placed in a bigger box, hospital room, which is part of a bigger box, the hospital hall, which is placed into a bigger box, the whole hospital building itself. Then he goes on to state that we are then taken home and put in a box, the crib, which is in a box the room, part of the bigger box the whole house. After this we go to school and the classroom becomes our box after we graduate we our placed in our dorm room box and walk from class to class or box to box. After we finally manage to get a job our cubicle or office which then becomes our box. Then he goes on that when we die they dig a box and put you into a box. My boyfriend's theory always brings a smile to my face as I remember when he first told me this. Wow, that only took me ten minutes. I look around my room and see all my pictures and think about going back to high school, I believe that those are some of the best times in my life. My class was very small and we all got to know each other very well. I have always been told that college is the best time of you life but it will take a lot to compete with high school. I hope it becomes the best time of my life. I have already come to enjoy it and have become adapted to college life. I love being able to do whatever I want when I want to. I hope these next few years will become the best years of my life.  ",1
1815,"     I'm just sitting here in my dorm room wondering what exactly i'm supposed to do on this assignment. Will the professor scold me for writing the incorrect responses?  I'm not sure. I can hear 2 things right now. One in my air conditioner. It sounds like a small, fast moving fan. A fast moving fan that doesn't seem to cool the room at all. I can also hear the neighbors' music through the wall. Now that I think of it, i can hear the soft hum of my computer as well. I'm looking at an award that's hanging on my wall I earned playing tennis for my high school. Now i'm thinking about my high school friends. Steph, Bree, Ki, Ashley, James, Niko, John, and Kenton were my closest friends. I miss them but I'm so excited about my new life. Ryan was my good friend in high school too, but I guess i didn't include him in that list because he's my roomate. I was going to try and not mention Annie, but that's really who I'm thinking about. I met Annie at Camp Texas about a week before school. She's a really wonderful person that I'm very attracted too. I'm looking at a Charlie Brown pez dispencer that she gave to me yesterday. Now I'm staring into my computer with because it has a large plexiglass window on the side. It's quite distracting, really. A jumble of customly installed wires is to me something like a low rider car to another person. Now i see a router that I'm going to use to hook up our network when we get road runner installed in our dorm room. I took 2 years of networking class in high school, and after the first sememster i was convinced that was what i wanted to spend my life doing. However, I recently decided that networking wasn't my true aspiration so I don't really know what I want to do specifically. I'm told that's okay and i will figure it out soon enough, and i beleive it. I think I'm getting kind of sick so i took some medicine earlier and have a bad taste in my mouth from the medicine. Now i'm thinking I should go work out tomorrow at Gregory. My friend told me that there's another good gym near Gregory but there aren't as many girls there. Now I'm wondering what i'm going to write about for my last 10 minutes, I really have no clue. I could explain how I put my computer together, or what each part does. I could talk about my high school tennis experiences, about my family, or about my high school hobbies. My roomate has arrived and i greeted him, he went to his bed and is watching TV, some sort of sports I'm sure. We went to the football game last Saturday. UT won 27-0. UT scored all 27 points in the first half, so the second half was pretty boring. It was still better than I expected for my first college football game. I really want to go see the OU game this year, but tickets are a hot commodity. After this assignment, I'm going to try to do some Economics, and maybe Calculus. This class, Psychology, is the class I'm most worried about this semester. I took Calculus in high school and I think with a little studying I'll be able to make a B in it. I don't know why but I have a great understanding for Economics so I don't think that class will be incredibly hard either. My communications teacher said that her class would be hard, but I think I'm better at communications that Psychology. I also have BA 101 and a Freshman Interest group class but those are pretty much participation grades, so a little time a effort will ensure an A. My schedule is incredible. None of my classes start before 11, and I have Friday's off from school. I find upperclassmen drooling over this schedule, so to find it as a freshman is pretty incredible, I think. As my time winds down I wonder what exactly this class has in store for me. Even college. Heck, even life. I wonder what big decisions I will make, what lucky breaks I will get, what major crises i will encounter, and what disadvantages I will overcome. All I can do is wish myself and my fellow peers luck and great success to find what we truly desire. ",0
422,"At the dorm where I live there is a girl that is Anorexic, and we all call her Annie for short. This s probably the rudest thing that you could ever possibly do to a person in this state, but then she doesn't know that we call her this. I am also confused about guys, and why they react the way they do. My friend told me the weirdest story about her weekend today. She said that she was dancing in a club and this really big guy started pissing on her leg, and then her boyfriend hit the guy right in the sweet spot, and the bouncers kicked her boyfriend out instead of the pisser. That is so not fair and disgusting!  I can not believe that someone would actually do that in the middle of a crowd of people. Anyway I really do not know what to talk about because I am really tired. I slept today for about two hours, and now I am more tired than I was before. I ate lunch at Papaduex today and I had Alligator for the first time. It was really good and it kind of tasted like chicken. Well I just talked to my boyfriend on the phone and he told me that one of the guys he used to work with died today in a high speed car accident. The funeral is on Tuesday, and he wants me to go with him because he can not cope with it by himself. I have a problem with dead people and funerals, and I swore that after my grandpa died, I would never go to another funeral. Well I really want to see a movie pretty soon, because I haven't seen one in a long time. I really need to see the Horse Whisperer, because I heard that it was a really good movie! ",1
199,"  It has taken me a few minutes to get the hang of things. Meaning, I didn't know the steps in getting set up to use the computer because I really have never had that much experience in using the computer. I went to set my e-mail account  yesterday and also got my IF account number. Let me see what else comes in mind I have no idea but to keep typing. Oh ya here with me is Brandi who is a senior and is helping me get to know my way around campus and also answering any questions I have over school. I am planning to go to the football game this weekend I am still not sure, because my friends don't know if they would rather go to  the football game or go home to Dallas for the weekend. I myself would rather go to the game. I almost forgot that I have to go to my apartment and clean up and then I have to go to the bookstore to return a book that I don't need. Well what else can I write about. . my twenty minutes are almost up but not quite yet. . . I am here staring at other people in the room looking for familiar faces but I don't see one. . . . . Something that just came  to my head was that I really miss my family, especially my mom. My sisters,  and brother mean a lot to me too, oh ya my nephew also is someone I miss a  whole lot. He is the most adorable kid I have ever seen I not saying this  because he is my nephew but because it is true. Time up. ",1
229,"This is one of the most interesting assignments to date in my educational career. Never before have I submitted my work over the computer. I pretty much knew what  I was going to write about when I got down here. my ex-girlfriend. She brings out a lot of sensations and feelings, and I can say most have been pleasant, but not lately. The guy next to me seems pretty cool. Some guy just sat down by me. looked like he was lost or maybe self-conscious because he didn't sit long. I guess this place isn't so bad. I've got a hangover. which isn't too bad, considering me excessive intoxication the night before. What a bitch. People type too damn loud!! The guy running this place seems somewhat dorkey. may that be an understatement. Ryan will be happy to know that I am finally going to break it off with her. It's what he wanted, and I too, but I couldn't do it myself. she's too damn manipulating and she's a bad, bad person. Who the hell is she to think that I'll always be here to pick her ass off the ground like some sort of surrogate mother. Last time I checked I don't have any breasts to breast-feed her. But I'll tell you who does. Tiffany Amber Thiessen (also known as val on 90210). They can't be real, say the girls I was watching the show with. what makes them experts on breasts, maybe the fact that they've had them for a long time. But every damn time a girl seems some guy with a ripped ass body they never take in to consideration that that shit could very well be fake, too. I wonder what that loud noise was. I think I curse to damn much. oh well. Yes that would be a cute chick next to me. but she doesn't look all that good. I don't see  any fine girls in here. people talk too much. there are a lot of fine girls here but not as many as were anticipated. now sixth street is where you'll find a lot of honnies. Sixth street is where you'll find a lot of stuff, that's where I got my tattoo, which everyone has said they liked it except the artist(known as forest) who tattooed it on my back. Probably because there's too much detail and his lazy  ass didn't want to do it all. I've got four more minutes left to this assignment  and some guy just dropped his calculator. dumbass. I'm thirsty . und ein bischen hungry, that was a little German for those wondering(hope I spelled it right). It's odd as soon as we see someone or meet someone we immediately pass judgment on  them, we don't know these people but we judge them one first impressions. which can be positive or bad. my first impressions come off better when I've had a little  to drink, not that my sober impressions come off as bad, I can always entertain  people better when I've had a little to drink. . gotta go ",0
857,"I have just finished reading the second chapter of the psychology textbook for class today. My room mate is always playing spades on the internet. I type very loudly. My subwoofer speaker system really looks cool the way I have it set up on my desk. This is a very odd, but interesting, assignment. The combination of the fan and air conditioner noise is driving me crazy. It is like the drone of a prop-plane. My computer is constantly checking for viruses and is always making little ""engine"" noises while I am typing. My room mate has a very odd way of typing. As I am doing this assignment, I am hearing myself talk the words as I type. I am sure that I have always done this, however, until now I have not noticed it. I believe that I just heard thunder. we could use the rain. I can't believe that we had a pop test in spanish today. I have a knot in my stomach. I know that I did poorly on it. I have a great spanish resource. my 501 verbs book. My monitor also makes a noise that sounds like I would imagine electical energy to sound. I want to go home this weekend. I miss my brother. I am going to bring him to Austin sometime to hang out with me and see the sights of UT. What time is it?  I wonder if my package has arrived in the mail room, yet?  I wonder what my dad thinks of all of my difficulties with the percussion ensemble here?  I would like to retreat to Lake Tahoe and bask in the glory of the crystal clear water and the Sierra Nevadas. That was a very random thought. All of the intricacies of the human brain are very amazing. If my cardiothoracic surgery bid does not work out, maybe neurosurgery could be an option. I have never had a class quite like psychology 301. I like the fact that it is web based. If I happen to miss a class, it is relatively easy to track down what was discussed. And even if the web doesn't have the information, the study sessions should cover the material again. I wish that I would have attended the first study session. I wish that I hadn't signed up for the molecular biology honor society. my plate is full already. That is such a strange idiom. I wonder how it came about. I wonder if idiom is the correct term for that expression. I have a very nice printer. It's fast, silent, and very clean looking. I am definitely a strange guy to be admiring his Deskjet!  I had to buy a lot of books for my spanish class. It has turned out to be my hardest class. I do not think that I am going to take any more spanish after this semester. I don't think that I was truly prepared to take spn312k, but I must have guessed well on the Wisconson test. I hope that my friend Cory does well at Rutgers this weekend. I can hardly believe that he was the number one defensive pick in the nation. It seems like just the other day when we were playing together for Cunningham Middle School. Now the guy is 6'5"", 245lbs. !  I really enjoy football and I miss the contact, but my I'M experience this fall should be a lot of fun without all of the bruises. I really want to lift weights tonight, but I don't believe that I will have time. I also want to train with Daniel, but I don't know what he has planned for tonight either. It feels like I have been thinking for hours, but It has only been a few minutes. This definitely reinforces the fact that the mind is better than any computer mankind can build. At least until some sort of artificial intelligence comes along. And even then, that won't compare because ""artificial"" is in the name. I really hope that my timer goes off soon and I can stop writing. I think that it would be really cool if I could guess the exact time the buzzer will sound without looking at the clock. It would be like ESP. That reminds me of a kid who did a debate over the existence of ESP in fifth grade gifted/talented class. It makes me feel good to say that I have been identified G/T. That's very cocky sounding, but I don't believe that I have told anyone of my identification in years. I have a problem with cockyness. I had better watch out or someone or something is going to come along and put me to shame in embarrasing fashion. ",1
1234,"Okay I guess I should begin this by mentioning a little bit about me I guess that's one thing we can I mean I can talk about. I was wondering when I was going to put a period in. That's one thing I'm bad at, I forget to put periods. I hate computers especially when they act up I mean I don't hate them it's just there so sensitive almost like people. People are sensitive to things like for instance today this guy I was talking to. I brought up why I had only seen him say hi to hispanics. Because I feel that you should be as friendly with every sort of people. However I know he's not a racist but I just wanted to bring that issue up to him to hear his response. This question was what my other friend said had made him mad. But hey I'm just frank like that I can't help it. I think now that I'm getting into the mode of things I'm starting to realize how my old self is coming out of me but I told myself that I was going to be me. Not to stop or halt to my small voices in my head. Actually its just one I don't want to give you all the idea that I'm schizo or anything. However I wanted what drugs can do to one. Is there any positive effects from psychedelic drugs? But I'm too afraid to find out that answer. That is something that I've noticed here in campus. It seems to be the main issue at hand but I also think that I just may surround or interact with people with a drug background. Like the book said you group yourself with people like yourself. That's so great about college, no matter who you are you'll find someone like you or for you. Right now I'm working on the female part of that companionship. I read somewhere that right now at this age one is in an endless tireless search for love even to the extreme of promiscuity. But I guess its pretty lame talking about my love life on this assignment but ""hey"" no one said I was confined to a set of topic. In fact, as I understood it. it's pretty much what we want to write about it. Is that not true, I think so. Notice how I'm burning time writing about nonsense. Or B. S. as some might call it. I'm really glad that I didn't procrastinate this to the last second. The scary thing is that I'm doing this assignment at about twelve thirty or so. In that vicinity. I guess. I guess my time is up.

321,"I kind of don't know what to write. I am sitting here next to a guy who knows just everything about computer. I feel like I am stupid cause my typing speed and I didn't even know how to get on UT web page. Oh well, I will learn how to do that later. that is why I am here. I really like computer, I learned a lot about it in past two months. I really hope I still have AOL, so I can talk to some of my friends up there. I wrote like thousands of e-mails. But my e-mail box was empty. I can't believe it. Did all those friends of mine forget about me!!!!! Oh well! they are not really friends. I don't even know what they look like. I don't really care, but I like e-mails. I like getting attentions. =) I really miss my boyfriend. he is in Houston, and I am going back tomorrow. Coming to college can be so much trouble. I hate facing problems on my own. I need someone like watch my back or something. I need my boyfriend's support. He can be so sweet sometime. he makes me forget all the problems. I always call him when I am in stress. taking to him makes me feel comfortable. Man! my phone bill is going to scare me. but I can't help to call him. he means a lot to me. he is black. My parents don't really know about him. I wonder what will happen if I tell them. Like all other Chinese parents, they probably kill me or something. I wish my parents understand, but I don't expect too much. I know how it is like. they don't really know much about other race. They didn't even like my exboyfriend, because he is half Vietnamese half white. I been typing for a long time, but there is like so little on the screen, oh well I am going to type a little longer. I wonder how does the instructor know how long did I write. is there is clock in this program or something. it like counts the how long I been writing. I am like so surprised myself, I am writing a home work on the day I got it. and the due day is like a month away or something. I need to study more in college. I wonder if I can. I am afraid to promise myself, cause I might not do it. oh well , let's see how things go. My life is so hard. I wish I can write like everyone else. I wish English was my first language. no I don't, I am happy I can speak two language, but it was so painful when I didn't know how to speak English. it will always be a scar for me, mentally I mean. I always talk about how hard it was. I don't know if people like to hear it. Man, this page is wide. Is there a way I can make it narrow. I been writing for so long. this thing is such a pain. but I know it is good for me. I can improve my writing or something, but it is for psychology class. Anyway, it is cool. ok, I been writing for a while, I think it is enough. I am gonna stop. okay bye, until next time. =)   gone sleeping =P ",0
1223,"Moving here to Austin has had me thinking about all sorts of things, about my life in general. These past few weeks, I have been analyzing about every aspect of my life. I am constantly running countless memories of my life by home through my mind. As excited as I am to be here, and I much as I dislike the city I moved from, I cannot help but miss my friends and family and all that I left behind. I am not the most outgoing of people and I find it difficult to strike up conversations with random people, therefore prolonging any new friendships. I love this city, though and I am trying to come out of my shell and be the fun loving, loud girl I was back home. My friends and family back home reassure me it will only be a matter of time before I begin to feel right at home and have a whole new hoard of friends, but until then, I feel very lonely. My roommates on the other hand are worse off than me. The three of them are all friends of mine from back home. They all have boyfriends with who they are in constant contact with. They are eternally homesick and pretty much no fun whatsoever. I am a person who finds it difficult to hang around the house all day, but they on the other hand do not even want to go out to explore the city. So they are a big drag in my social life. Hopefully by the end of the year, I will have gotten them to enjoy party life at least half as much as I do, that is if I can tear them away from their cell phones for more than five minutes. All this time at home has allowed me to build up a nice collection of songs from the internet, and enjoy all the benefits the internet has to offer. I have been able to chat with friends near and far in length without any phone charges, which is always nice. Yes I am very happy to be here in Austin, but I just want this transitional phase to fly by so I can feel right at home. I am not even so much homesick as I am just lonely. With my circle of friends limited I do not have much to do except things on my own. Perhaps that is not such a bad thing, seeing as how I am doing some definite soul searching on my long lonely walks and my hours spent at bookstores, and libraries. ",0
1465,"How do you know when you can really know what another person feels. How do I learn to trust what people say to me. It's hard for me to be in a relationship when I can't see that person everyday. I know that I am the kind of person that would never want to cause any pain, yet I see people who are in relationships for such wrong reasons. My friend was telling me that she is dating this guy yet already has plans on leaving him for something better. I don't understand why people can be so selfish to where they don't think of other peoples feelings. I am in a very intense relationship right now. I love my boyfriend with all my heart. Having a long distance relationship is very hard to deal with when you are the type of person who needs that comfort of a companion. I know how I feel for him and I think I know what he feels for me to, yet in a world where people can be so deceitful, I find it still possible that I can be the one being used in a relationship. I guess you must do what your heart tells you to because love is a risk. I believe it is worth taking. When you love someone, you have this vulnerable feeling towards them. I don't want to walk blindly into a relationship, being overwhelmed by the feeling of love but I would want to see how the flow goes. I want to learn how to be a good companion. I hope someday to make a really good wife. I find it important to marry your best friend. I can't wait until I figure out what life has in store for me. I want to do so many things and right now I feel so limited. I just hope that no matter what happens with my relationship now I can keep a friendship. I believe that the first love of your life will never die, and true love lives in you forever. I can never imagine not loving him anymore. I don't want to be person that is dependent on someone else but I do think that it is good to have someone to run to when things do always go right. Sometimes I feel like I don't know what to say when he runs to me with difficulties in his life. He always seems to know what to say to make me smile. When he told me about his cousin in the hospital and how he figured the funeral would be coming soon, I had no idea what to say. I didn't know what to tell him other than the only thing we can do is pray for him. I believe that that is all we have when we come to situations like that. I just wish I could talk to him and be able to be more comforting. I have to feel like I am bringing him a sense of comfort in this relationship. I love him so much and I don't want him to suffer any pain. It is just so hard not being able to physically be there for him because just the comfort of having someone at your side, can help you get through rough times. When I do see him I will hopefully know what to say when that moment comes. I find that ever chance that we do get to see each other I try to absorb the feeling of his presence. I try to remember his scent and the way his lips feel against mine. It's so hard to let go of him. I just want to try to treasure that moment so that it can get me through another week. I miss hearing his voice even though we talked just a day ago. So how do I do this going maybe four years of living in another city. My life right now is perfectly the way that I have always planned and dreamed, except for living away from him. I know that I am not in a place to compromise. I can't compromise my education. I have always dreamed of going to this university and now that I am here, I wouldn't dream of letting this go. Yet my problem is that I don't know that I could ask him to give up what he is doing, because I love him and I know that he loves what he does. Yes, it is possible that he could move to Austin, considering there are jobs available to him, but I wouldn't want him to make that decision because of me. I would want him to have more than me to move. So we just seem to take it day by day, but I can't help but ask ""Where are we going to be next semester, next year or after I graduate?"" my question must wait until the time happens. I have to just learn to have patience and see where destiny takes me. I will become stronger through all of this. I hope to learn selfconfidence and to be more dependent. I know that I have many good things to bring out to people and someday I will know who the person is that deserves my love and affection. Maybe I know it now but in time I will find out whether I am right or not ",1
1937,"Damn, I should have smoked a cigarette before I started writing. Now I have to wait for twenty minutes. It's cold in here, I thought that I turned the AC off. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be writing. When I have to think about typing it's hard to figure out what else I'm thinking about. Today's September 11th isn't it?  I wonder if anything is going on. I wish I didn't have to work on Saturday. I want to go tubing with Brandon and his family. That sounds like so much fun. I hate having to work and go to school. It's so pointless, driving an hour each way, just to work for a few hours. It makes no sense, and neither does them cutting my hours because they're over on manager hours when I've only worked one day so far this week and they're wasting all there manager hours having Danielle and Craig come in at four in the morning to work on truck. That's fourteen manager hours that they're throwing away off hours when we always have to have a manager there when the store is open and just because Craig wants to be off by noon because Sunday is the only day that Craig gets to see his boyfriend, never mind that they live together. And never mind the fact that my boyfriend, all my friends and family live in another city. Never mind. Days of Our Lives is on in the next room. I think that this storyline has been going on for about a year and a half. My arm is falling asleep. It's amazing how they can drag a single conversation out for an entire week on these shows. I've decided to boycott the news. All they do is perpetuate a society of fear. The only stories that make it to the news have to involve murder, terror or death. They don't even need reasons anymore. all they have to do is say we are in orange. you must be afraid. be very afraid. Cut to commercial. consume. consume consume. That movie Bowling For Columbine captured the whole American fear thing so perfectly. How ironic that Michael Moore criticizes the United State's part in foreign wars, Bush's policies and all that crap throughout the movie. he wins two Emmy's for it and criticizes this stupid war in his acceptance speech, and is ridiculed for it. You can say whatever you want to in a documentary, we'll even award you for it, but don't you dare say anything bad about this war or our incompetent president when you're wearing a tuxedo. Now my toes are falling asleep, too. I probably shouldn't sit like this. I hope I can catch the bus on time in the morning, and I hope it's still free for students. Now my toes are tingling. Damn, I still have four minutes to go. I wonder what the next assignment is going to be. I'm not sure how accurately someone can actually write in stream of consciousness from their own perspective. When you write, no matter how fast, you choose what you put on the paper and you are limited in what you are thinking about to what you are writing. The best stream of consciousness stuff that I have read has been highly ordered and well thought out by a writer who is writing the thoughts of a fictional character. Like in Sound and the Fury. I can't remember who wrote that. I don't think that it was Fitzgerald. Oh, cool, my time is up. ",1
1391,"Writing this paper on Friday is extremely irritating for me. I know that I was given plenty of time beforehand, but being the procrastinator that I am I waited until the last minute. This annoys me because I usually do this on most of my assignments. I have a feeling of regret that I didn't do it beforehand. It is hard for me to concentrate seeing that after I am done writing this assignment I am going to go back home to visit some of my friends I haven't seen in awhile. This gives me a good feeling. It is almost a feeling of relaxation and anticipation all in one. Tonight I am also going to go to a football game in my hometown. Thinking about watching a football game gives me a rush. I get flash backs of my quarterback going through the snap count, my heart pounding with anticipation and anxiety as I am about to get the ball, the snap, and a huge burst of adrenaline as I get the ball. Thinking back through each step  I can feel the emotion that was accompanied each step, only at a lower level. I am also extremely tired having stayed up way to late last night. This is probably why I am finding trouble concentrating and being consistent with certain ideas. I also feel confused because I really think that this isn't what the professor wanted, but too bad. ",1
1752,"      I am so glad that I am finished with that stupid test for psy. Now when I finish this I can take a nap. I need to do laundry and get ready for tonight. I need to get the money that Clint and Dilen owe me to do the laundry. I am not sure what I am going to wear tonight. I am tired. I hope that we get tickets to the OU football game, I really don't want to go stand in line and wait though. I hope that Stephanie and Adam will not be mad because I didn't get the tickets. I like Adam a lot. He is a really cool guy and I am really glad that we are friends. I like to have close guy friends. Clint is cool too. although I have to admit that I found him attractive at first. He isn't hot or anything, but it is something about his personality. I know that he has a girlfriend, but I have Ryan too. I love Ryan and I wouldn't mess anything up with him for Clint. I don't like him that much. My arms really hurt from being on the computer so much. My whole body hurts from exersizing so much latly. I want to loose weight so badly. I wonder how this will be graded, I don't suppose that there is a right or wrong answer, but what if I am writing about the wrong thing. I think I over think things. I wish Ryan was here. You know I think that, but I am really not sure if he was here I would like it. I mean there is a certian degree of independence without anyone here. I think that everyone follows their path diferently than others.  I mean Ashlee is getting married. I know that I don't want to get married, but do I really want to stay with Ryan forever. I think so, but it just baffles me how I know that circumstances were different with me then I would be in a sorority and would go out and party a lot. Maybe it is good for me to not to have some of the luxuries that others have and it will let me make better decisions. I just don't understand why money makes a person. Maybe this is really steriotipical, but I think if you have money you can do a lot of the things that poorer people couldn't do. That sucks. I thought that all people are equal and God gave us all differnt abilities and in the end we are not all alike, but rich in differnt areas of our life. The more that I think about it though I am not sure that is the case. I mean maybe it is true and life isn't fair!  That would suck too by the way. I personally think that some of my frinds grew up better that me and therefore they will turn out better than me. Kiley is very introverted and wants to go home. that is one thing that I have over her. I don't want to go back to Denison. I see Austin as a second chance for me and I will break out of the social barrier that I had at home. I mean don't get me wrong, I had good parents that loved me and always gave me the best they could, but my mom wasn't as involved as others were and I think that hurt me socially in highschool. I wasn't in the popular crowd and I am not sure if I want to be. ",0
861,"Why do I have this pimple? Why does it matter what people look like so much? I am sure that if we were all turned in inside out, and what was inside of us was on the outside, well first of all, we would look pretty damn disgusting, but if who we were was on the outside of our body, the world would be better. I am sure that there wouldn't be as many people wanting to show off their ""body"", because their new ""body"" would be who they were, and not everyone is happy with who they were. I went to my first college frat party last night, and it was one of the worst nights of my life. My best friend and I had this inclination to go there and do nothing but talk to people. He has a girlfriend, and I just didn't want to meet a girl there for other than friends purposes. It was HORRIBLE. It was crowded as heck, the music was too loud, so that in order for anyone to even understand you, you had to use a megaphone, and to be socially ""accepted"" you had to have a beer in  your hand. Now, one might think that would be an excuse, but I didn't see, but 15 out of at least 200+++++ without a beer. For some reason, I want to spell beer, bear, but don't let me please. Thanks. :o) Well, it was so dumb. My best friend and I walked around the whole time just walking, because in this one room, the music was so damn loud you had to use a megaphone to talk to people, and I'm not all about that. I am not the stud who has all the looks, but can't talk to people worth a damn. It doesn't matter though, if you are that stud, because the girl is too busy dreaming about your looks that she doesn't give a poop what you are saying. I am more a people person. I like to make people laugh. I don't do it on purpose, like go out of my way to make people laugh, but it's the way I am. I have this quirkiness (thanks Sooze) about me, but I love it. I don't want to be that stud that can't talk, because I am pretty happy with myself, until last night, when I had this feeling going into this party that girls in general had changed. My whole life, I have been nice, and I go by the saying ""Nice guys finish last"". I had this feeling that it might all change in college, but the answer is ""nope"". I was at my friends house, and her roommates were all telling me that it had changed, and that girls now were looking for long lasting relationships, and they didn't want all that highschool bullshit that they had gone through before. Okay, I know this sounds superficial, but these weren't bad looking girls either. Two were pretty darn cute, and the third wasn't too bad at all, so it isn't that the (excuse me god for saying this) more ugly girls were saying this, but they were girls that you would classify as pretty hot and tempting. I hate using the word ugly, and I hate judging people. I don't. I always hear my friends going up, and saying ""Aaron, how in the hell does that guy have that beautiful girl, when he is so damn ugly"". Okay, first of all, I am thinking that they are jealous, but evenso. Why? Why does it matter what he looks like? Why can't he be a  nice guy, who finally beat the system, and found himself a gorgeous girl that appreciates who he is. How he treats her. What he does for the world. What is up with this world? I NEVER say that shit, because there is no reason for it. I hate saying ""oh, he is ugly"" and just making fun of people in general, because if you look at me, I am not the best looking guy on campus, and I have no right in heck to say that. I HATE HATE when my friends say it. But, it's the world. College was supposed to be different. The time for me (the outgoing quirky boy) to make some friends, and go out and have fun. It hasn't quite been that, and granted, I have only been here for a couple of days, but I am scared. I am scared that it is going to be like this for the rest of the year. I mean, I go out and meet people, but I don't know when or how to ask for their number, because it's just too weird in my eyes. We say when we leave ""See  you around"", but have you realized the size of this campus. It's freakin' amazing. There are 50,000 students here, and it is atrocious as to how big this school is. It was supposed to be different. I mean, don't get me wrong, I don't have 12 eyes, and I have all my teeth, but it is still the same as in high school. I get befriended by the girls, which honestly is fine with me, because well, maybe it isn't. Maybe it would be nice to be gawked over for once, and maybe it would be nice to be wanted by a few girls here and there, but as of yet, it hasn't really happened. It's not that I am looking at all, because I am in love with Sooze, but it would be nice to have that feeling that when I walk into a room, people stare. I promise you this. if who we were was what we looked like on the outside, I would get those stares. Thank you for your time. ",1
69,"I have done these things before and I really don't think that they work. I had to do one in English one time and I hated it. I guess maybe it works for some people but your conscious of what your doing so it seems like it really isn't a true way to examine your thoughts like if you were simply thinking in a park or something right now I will indulge the assignment and try to switch my thoughts all around. I love scream, its on the tv right now and I like this movie. ;  I here that the second one is do out this winter so IÃ¯Â¿Â½m excited. I really enjoy some of the lectures in the class especially the ones lately about the various functions of the brain. The brain is so complex. I used to think about the brain and wonder if my brain knew I was thinking about itself. Hmmm, I don't know what to say  exactly. I am gonna play some pool after I get done writing this paper. I have a pool table at home so I am probably better than average but lately I've been playing worse and worse. It really frustrates me too. I hate when I don't play basketball for a while because then I go back and I'm just A LITTLE OUT OF RYTHEM OR I MISS A SIMPLE SHOT OR SOMETHING. Recently I have smoked a cigarette every once in a while and I feel bad about that because I always pre3ached against it to my friends and it is bad for athletes because it effects your breathing a little because you can't breathe in as much. I'm being A BIT Distracted by the tv and my twenty minutes are half way up. I don't know I f  I can really   fill up another ten minutes but I guess I can because I have to. It really isn't hard because its just free thought but its controlled free thought because I've got the monitor and keyboard in front of me so I don't think your mind can wonder as much. along those lines I don't know if I agree with the stats that the teenage male thinks about sex every eight seconds or whatever because I know I don't think of sex that much. Imagine if when you were talking to your dear old granny A hot naked women flashed into your mind. how bizarre and distracting that would be to everyday life. I often wonder what the stats for how much women think about sex is. I wish that they thought about it as much as guys, but if they did the population of the earth would be worse than it already is and we really can't have that lets see   mgmhmmhfmfm sorry . I coughed. ehehehehe  I think I have come to another point of not really being in a thought process. I wonder how weird the papers are that you guys get I would love to be able to read some of them . I think that you should post some of them in class  so we can all laugh at the similarities that are sure to exist between our entries. I don't know what IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve been told . I like led zep but not all of their stuff. It is pretty good though . I wonder if classic rock will be around for several more decades . I hope so Oh my time is up so I'm gonna go know. Bye bye baby!!!! ",0
1103,"This is probably the weirdest writing assignment I have ever had to do. Usually we are always told almost exactly what to write, but I like the idea of doing this a lot more. I'm not too sure what you guys actually do with this things, but that's fine with me, because I'd much rather me doing this than writing some boring long paper. Today is a Friday, the second best day of the week. Thursday is the best, because my classes end at 12:30 and I only have one class on Fridays, so my weekend pretty much starts on Thursdays. College life is so much better than high school life. I love having all the freedom. The only part I would change is having someone making sure I get up in the morning for all my classes, I seem to be having problems with that, but I don't think it will happen anymore. I joined a fraternity, so I think that is helping making college more fun. Usually when most people think fraternity, they imagine the typical fraternity and everything that goes along with it, mainly the hazing. I joined Lambda Chi Alpha, and it is a national policy of theirs not to haze, so I have nothing to worry about. I've heard stories about other fraternities hazing already, and I don't understand what the point of it is. Completely stupid! Why would you want to put people through the different kinds of suffering if you're going to live with them for the next 4 years? Yes, I understand that it can build strong bonds between each pledge class, but it just means you are always going to hate the class above you that hazed you. Being in Lambda Chi is incredibly awesome, I can't imagine me ever having any regrets. By joining my freshman year, it makes me feel more comfortable at UT than I think I would have been if I had not joined. I no longer think of myself as just another random person, or number, at UT, because I know belong to something. I'm just kind of rambling on here, not really being able to think of much to say. I'm wondering if these are going to be used as examples of things in class, or if they have some other purpose we are unaware of. I think I'll talk more about me, because I'm such a great topic(hint of sarcasm there). I feel incredibly comfortable with my life. I think I am extremely at ease in most situations, and I think I have a good grip on life. I've moved around a lot, so I think that has helped me. I was born in Scotland and lived there for two years, then I lived in England for seven years, then California for three years, then New Jersey for a year, then I moved back to the same city in California and lived there for almost five years, then three days before the start of my junior year in high school I moved to Texas, where I graduated, but my family now lives in California again. Being moved around a lot and thrown into new situations has probably made the transition from living at home to being at college a lot easier for me than for other people. When I moved before the start of my junior year, I absolutely hated my parents for taking me away from my friends, and my life, but now I think it has made me a better person because I seem to just go with the flow now and except everything as it happens. Alright, well time is up, so I'm going to go. ",0
486,"Well I have been thinking about a dream I had last night which was bothersome. I have only vomitted twice in my life and so my dream had to do with me throwing up all over the place and in my dream I was trying to wake up from the dream because I don't like throwing up. I was also thinking about all of my school work. I am very frustrated with the pre-testing website because I can never get on it. There always seems to be some sort of technical difficulty, and I don't know what to do about it and so I came up with one solution and that is to get Netscape Navigator but that also didnt work out like I had hoped. So I tried to see if there was a problem with my Internet provider so that whole thing is causing a lot of frustration for me. Well I don't like thinking about it too much because I am hoping sometime between now and September 11th my problem willl be solved. I am also overwhelmed in my spanisk 312L class which my last semester of a language and it is very difficult and I dread going to class every MWF from 12-1. As I am writing this I keep thinking about how the instructions of this assignment says not to worry about grammar but I still have to make sure that I haved spelled every word correctly not so much the punctuation but the spelling. This assignment is very fun for me. Also I am thinking about the conversation my roommates and I had last night about God right after we were discussing God in class on Monday. We had a two or so hour conversation about death and God after I had stated that the ONE subject that I do not like talking about is death. So ofcourse we talk about death and then we go on to have a deep conversation which is something I enjoy doing from time to time just to see what other people feel about certain topics. I am also constantly thinking about guys that I used to know in high school and the one or two that are a year younger than me that I still talk to and that have at one point or another had an attraction to but don't know what will come of it meaning whether or not I will stay friends with the two boys as time goes on. I am also thinking about what is going on on the television show that is on in my room. It has to do with sexual harassment and it is the guy accusing the woman of sexual harassment at a Dominos Pizza Company. And he won the landmark case. It is funny because the comedy show that was on prior to the present show had to do with the same issue. Well that is all --- This assignment was very pleasing to me because I enjoy doing assignment like this. ",0
629,"I'm really not sure what to write because I just am not feeling anything right mow but I am feeling good because I am listening to good music and that is something that will always make me feel good and I don't know why but even if I am really down music picks up and makes me feel better and I especially like to go to see live shows that is just about the only thing I really love to go out and do usually I would rather just sit at home and watch TV or listen to music. I am also feeling hungry and my roommate is making some vegetarian chili which kind of scares me because I am not really into vegetarian meals but hey I might as well eat it if he is going to make it. I am also wondering how long I have been writing because it seems like a long time but I think it has only been like ten minutes or so and I am running out of things to say. I guess could talk about this girl I am seeing. She is really cool but I don't really think I want to get involved with her in the way she wants to get involved with me, but I guess I should go out on another date before I come to that conclusion. That has been something that has been bothering me because she apparently likes me a lot, but I just don't think I like her in that way that she likes me and guess that now I am out on my own this is the first real problem I have had was dating and to tell you the truth it scares the hell out of me because when it comes to sex you never know what kind of diseases a girl might have and that scares me a lot.

2016,"I hope that this isn't a big deal, as I have to write for 20 minutes in a completely random manner. If I get graded on content or grammar, I'm simply done now. I've been caring a lot about my grades so far and I'm going to need to keep it up to get into law school at someplace like Georgetown or Columbia. I actually miss NYC a lot, but its a nice change down here and I'm happy to get out of Connecticut. I do miss my family a little, but I think they are doing fine and I'll be seeing them in no time. I'm glad my dad is going to be at the lacrosse tournament in Vegas come October. Still can't believe we lost in the state semi's to crappy Amity. That one kid was really good though. Maybe playing at UT will be just as fun and we'll have success. Seems like Texas lacrosse is nothing to ours, but I shouldn't get cocky yet. Its only a club team. Nobody better come in my room even though the door is open. Don't feel like being social, and its late. Its annoying that dumb Mark always locks it too every single time one of us is out of the room for five seconds. In fact, Mark is annoying in general. He seemed fine when we talked online prior to coming here, but he reminds me of Mendelson at home so much. I don't do well with these leech people too, I wish he wouldn't follow me around. But you know what, he is a really nice kid and I feel terrible saying these things, especially in some assignment that someone is reading. At least I'm nice to him in person. Waking up to him puking this morning was not cool either. ah he is awake, he better not get up here and read the screen like he always does. bah. Its funny coming to college after you're used to your friends at home. I'm glad that I don't know anyone and I'm on my own. You get to the point where you expect things of people and you know your friends so well, so coming here puts you out of your element for a bit. I think I'm meeting decent people though and I only expect to meet more and more cool people. At first I was pretty skeptical about everyone, but that's just because I was missing the guys I've had a good time with for years. Time to move on. plus I always said I needed to get out of little lame Brookfield. Zebrahead is the bomb. I don't think I ever get tired of their music. I'd like to see them in concert again sometime soon but they don't really have any dates posted. And IF I do see them again, I'm going to chill towards the back and just listen. Being up front was crazy, but its hard to enjoy sometimes when you have some annoying girl giving you elbows to the kidneys and her nappy sweaty weave is sticking to your clothes and skin. But hey, its the price you pay I suppose. Radio 104 fest was still probably the most fun of all concerts though, hahahahh especially when we dropped that girl that was crowd surfing and kicking people in the faces on purpose and she started bleeding. Its horrible I know, but its really not cool what she was doing. Plus, she was not seriously injured. girls shouldn't crowd surf anyways, there are too many dirtbag guys who are just trying to crop a feel. HAHA Like that one guy who ripped the girl's thong off. Speaking of which, I need to meet some more girls here. Emily has completely drained me over the past two years and I'm glad that I can finally be away from her and her attachment and be able to meet some people. I do like that one girl in astronomy, she seems pretty cool. Its too bad I don't see much potential in meeting anyone on or around my floor, they are all pretty private. I don't see what Tyler and Jeremy and Luke see in the girls upstairs too, they're just really loud and annoying, and not the most attractive of ladies either. You got to love UT, there are attractive girls everywhere. AHAHAH To whoever is reading this, I apologize for sounding like a complete jackass. I've talked about dropping girls on their heads, and how I think people are ugly, and how I don't think people are too cool, and how Texas lacrosse isn't very good. I probably sound like one arrogant loser. I'm really not. but I do admit that I am very confident in myself, and I think that rubs off on how I express myself. Actually, I'm probably just pretty arrogant. 311 is the best. Again, the playlist is sidetracking my thoughts. I wish I went to see them in concert here last week, but I've seen them before and I had class early the next day. Live music is the best. I think seeing STP and Cake here the first night I visited put a pretty positive spin on the place for me, that was pretty tight. There's a whole lot to do here, I love it. Last night at Sixth Street was pretty fun too even. Everything just seems cool here. I'm drawing a blank here. just listening to music. Maybe I should I have left it off when I started writing. yep drawing a blank again. Wonder if Cameron is back at his ghetto dorm yet, he is going to have to start writing this too, and I bet I'll have mine finished by the time he even gets back in his room. Okay, my 20 minutes are up, and I could continue if I wanted to, but I'm pretty tired so I think it would be best for me to just hit the sack, or play Counter Strike. ",0
231,"I'm in the computer lab upstairs. I don't know what to write. there are a lot of people here. the computer next to me is broken but I don't know how. the guy who was sitting there earlier was kinda cute in a nerdy sort of way. some guy just walked behind me. there was a loud noise just now. donÃ¯Â¿Â½t know what it was though. kinda scared me cause I thought I did something wrong and the people who control the computers would come after me and make me pay a million dollars for the entire system. wow the girl next to me got a long email. I got a few emails today. why do people wear socks with sandals?  don't they know it doesn't look good?  the computer screen is huge. I bet you a million dollars that this is the stupidest writing assignment you will get back from a student. I don't really measure up to the rest of the class. wow the girl next to me is typing really slowly. I'm in the I section. how come on some computers I and l look the same and they also look like 1. ewwwwww that girl should NOT be wearing something so tight. I've been at this computer for a long time. how come there are so many blonde people here. I wouldn't want to have yellow hair. I want headphones so I can listen to music. I'll bring them next time. I'd do this from my room, but I don't have my Ethernet set up because the computer store doesn't have any software there. recycling is weird. why don't they make it a law that you have to recycle. and if you don't recycle, you get fined like a million dollars. why do people read when they should log onto their computer?  I mean, there are TONS of people waiting to use computers and then you have people like this who read instead of type. why do people sit at booths in the cafeteria alone?  don't they have common sense?  a booth is not for one person. it's for more than one person. that's why there are tables everywhere. so you can eat at tables alone in the corner instead of taking up a whole booth alone. there should be a law against that. IÃ¯Â¿Â½d enforce it. Emily's boyfriend's name is Steve. that's my boyfriend's name. only her boyfriend is close by. mine is far. it's sad. she's going to go out with me and her boyfriend this weekend. she's gonna have sex with him. I want to have sex. but StevenÃ¯Â¿Â½s so far away right now. I have a chem test on Wednesday. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m scared. I think IÃ¯Â¿Â½m gonna fail it. I have to study. tonight is Melrose place though so I can't study at 7. IÃ¯Â¿Â½ll study after that. I wanna party. I drank too much coke today. i want water. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m hungry. man it's cold here. how come my room is so cold?  I want to change the temp but then it might be too hot. every place is freezing here and it's hot as hell outside. is hell a bad word?  why do people think it's bad?  and why is God Damn so bad?  you can say ass on TV but not god damn?  and who decided it was bad anyway?  I wrote a high school essay about it one time but I have no idea. why are bad words bad words?  who decided they were bad. I want glasses. I think it makes you look smarter if you get a good pair that is. the computer next to me is broken. that noise was loud again. same noise as before. green is a cool color. forest green though. not the crappy lime greens and other green colors. forest green. aha!  IÃ¯Â¿Â½m right under the vent. that's why IÃ¯Â¿Â½m freezing. I can't wait for Melrose place tonight. IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve been waiting all summer for it. do you think Amanda's gonna leave?  she can't. she's my favorite. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m glad Allison left. BillyÃ¯Â¿Â½s a whiner. glad they killed Brooke off. ever watch 90210?  it's stupid. why do they have Braille on the number things that say what station you're on?  How would a blind person use a computer?  I want email. I get a ton of it but I want more. I want real letters though. I want to go down to the mail place and be able to say ""WOAH I GOT MAIL"". :( This paper was a cool one to write. I wanna do it again but I'll have to wait until tomorrow. I skipped class today. don't know why. I was lazy. I need to shape up or ship out. I never liked that phrase. who wants to ship out?  how can you ship out?  we're all on land. not at sea. StevenÃ¯Â¿Â½s joining the navy. I wish he wouldn't go. I want him to move here. why do people wear fanny packs?  they're not flattering. too many sorority chicks here. we have 2 kappa deltas on our floor. valley girls. UT Austin Recycles. I don't. do they make the whole school do it?  I love the smell of freshly done laundry. I did my laundry already but I want to do it again so it'll be all warm and smell good. I want to go to a party. I want to get drunk like on my vacation. not that drunk though. just drunk enough to have fun. wow that guy's cute. he looked at me. woo hoo. there are a lot of old people here. old old old. I wanna be older but I don't wanna get OLD. just hit submit and you'll get it huh?  that's cool. I still have to find my way here one more time to write it again. wow so much fun. there are too mane people here waiting for computers. I should go downstairs next time. warning!  when you log out all your files will be erased. duh. save em loser. psychology. how come every frat boy and sorority chick majors in psych?  how many psychologists can the world have?  did you know UT is the slacker school of the nation. I read that somewhere. isn't that cool?  this place is huge. wow he's a hippie. what am I?  normal. abnormal. quiet. loud. who knows?  IÃ¯Â¿Â½m me I guess. IÃ¯Â¿Â½d like to know what other people think about me though. might be interesting. time's up. I gotta go check my mail. ",0

1883,"     Alright, so this is my second time to do this, which is kind of weird. It's kind of draining to type out what you are thinking. I'm still worried about what I am going to do for my object exercise in Acting I. So many people have taken my ideas. But since we are all the same age, we pretty much have the same issues and experiences so I'm just going to go with what comes natural to me. Ugh, I still can't get ahold of Jay. Unfortunately, openning night for his play falls on OU weekend which really sucks. Ugh, it seems like everything going on in my life conflicts with everything else. Speaking of OT game, the things they make us do just to tickets to some game. I mean, first you have to wait in line to get a wristband and PRAY that you get a somewhat decent number. And then you have to go back and wait in line for the tickets, that is assuming you even get tickets. It's crazy and aboult a million people came up to me today asking me to get them tickets. Geez, I never thought going to a football game would be so stressful. On top of that, this week is the anniversary of September 11th and so now everywhere I go I am reminded of this horrible tragedy. I'm proud of our country coming together, but I don't think we should dwell on the bad things. We should move on, remember, and renew. For example, this morning I flipped on my TV and the first thing I have to see the images of 9,000 American people losing their lives. It just hasn't been a good day. Hopefully, Friday (yes, Friday the 13th) will be a bit better. Could this week spell   hell   more than one way?  Actually, tomorrow should be a pretty good day. Although it's going to be hectic, tomorrow night will at least be the Alpha Phi Fall Crush. OH YEAH!  Go Alpha Phi!  I'm excited since David gets to come too. It's going to be tons of fun. And this week is Big Sis week so I get a lil gift everyday too!  It's funny how little good things can measure out the big bad things. Oh and plus I am going home this weekend. Going home this weekend is just the thing I need. I miss my family and my dog sooo much. Aww, my cute little Pepper. I can't wait to see her. And my mom can wash some of my clothes for me!  WOOHOO!  Oh, and Friday night is callbacks for the play Helen. I am soo excited because I actually made a callback on my first audition here at UT. So that's one more good thing. Wow, maybe I should go over all the good things in my life more often. Then maybe I wouldn't feel so overwhelmed and stressed out as much. hmm, after this I better start reading biology. For being such a somber day, today (weather wise at least) was actually a really beautiful day. I have a great view of the sunset out my window. And since there is a church right across the street, the sunset lights up the huge cross so beautifully. Maybe one day I should take a picture of it. Oh yeah, I need to buy some more sticky tape to hang my posters with. You'd think something called   Poster Putty   would do the job but aparently the posters made out of paper are toooo heavy. And what's the deal with not being able to hang dorm lights. First of all, christmas lights are a dorm tradition, and secondly the package says   Dorm   lights so technically they aren't christmas lights. right?             ",0
1784,"     I am doing a stream of conscience assignment for pyshcology. Am I suppose to use correct grammar and punctation? I hope not. I still type using one finger, but I think I can type pretty fast foer using one finger. You think since I am using one finger that I wouldn't make any grammatical mistakes but that's not true. Oops am I suppose to time this?  Oh, no you time it for me. wow 20 minutes is a long time. I don't even look at the screen when I type. just the keybopard. my hands are tired. my favorite channel is TLC. It's great. Right now a story about conjoined twins are on. My boyfriends is back in plano. my thoughts jump around faster than i can type i don't have any thoughts anymore ihad to turn off the tv all i could do was listen to it maybe that is why i ran out of thoughts maybe that is why people say tv frys (or is it fries?) your brains  I don't think tv makes you studpi there are plenty of educational shows my sister learned to read through sesame sttreet, i don't miss my parents much is that bad?  It was kind of annoying living at home with them my phone is rinignfg am I allowed to get that i guess i can call them back in like 15 minutes i think it is the guy I met from they gym who was calling. College doesn't feel like its satarted. it still feels like summer fore me. I only have class every other day so its kind of hard getting into tht study mode. am I writing too much. am I suppose to just write a few thoughts as I have them or cointinuously type. I hope its continuosouyl type cause that is what I am doing. Do ya'll actually read this?  I wouldn't really want my   real   stream of consciencce read. Ithink thoughts and emotions are very personal and should only be expressed or shown in needed situations or with a person you trust. What if my   real   stream of conscience was that I wished somebody would blow up UT ( which it's not I promise). Ya'll would redflag me and secretly watch me, so I don't really like doing this assignment. I don't mind it actually. It's pretty simple and something interesting to do, I guess a way to learn about yourself. I don't like writing much. I use to keep a journal but I was too lazy to write in it all the time. usually when I wrote in it it was when I was pissed off, so everytime I went back and read it it seemed like I was a really angry person all the time. I wantred the journal to be like a memory book. But, if I was feeling any strong emoitons II didn't feel like writing in it. I guess I probably talked on the phone. My cell phone gets horrible reception here. It is hard to talk to my boyfriend back in plano cause he always breaks up. He's not really my boyfriend anymore, but he really is. I don't think that makes sense. Ten more minutes. so. my nails are shiny I'm tired of doing this. I don't get why we are doing this either. If mine is this long and there about 300 people in each class and say there are about 5 classes, that's 1,5000 papers. Nobody probably reads this. It is probably random spot reading if anything so this will get submitted and overlooked so I don't really see a point in this I wonder if everybody has around the same stream of conscience. I bet a lot of people are writing about how they have to do this assignment and they don't see a point to it really. I don't know what I want to be when I grow up. I wanto to make a lot of money. I was gooing to do psychology but everybody is doing it. 1 out of 3 people I ask are a psychology major. It is very interesting and I loved it in highschool, but future wise there's not much you can do with it as I see it. There is a teacher or a psychologist or maybe a social worker. And if 1 out of 3 people are doing it at UT and there is about 50,000 people, wells that's about 17,000 pyschologists and teachers alone from UT, there is still to mention Tech, and other schools where most people are doing psychology too. I think everyopne should take psychology though. but I think way too many people are majoring in it. Actually, I think majoring in it fine so that way you can get an extensive look at how human nature and the mind functions, but I think that knowledge should be applied to other fields. SO everyone should study pyschology, but not pursue a field in it. I really want to be a person who does case studies on dreams. I think dreams are so interesting. I had a dream about Roseanne the show and that I met the cast. It's really weird. I remebr thinking I should get their autographs so I can put it up on my wall. Sometimes, though, I think people see too much into dreams. I think people on drugs have deep dreams, or maybe they are having reaaly   fake   dreams. Like their brain is just so confused it is just sending randome imAages. I don't now. I think drugs let ypou tap into another side of your brain. I think they can open your mind. I think drugs like X can open your mind, but I think that you should learn how to open your mind without drugs. I think no one should do drugs on a regular basis. I wonder if a lot of philosophy and psychology teachers have done drugs. I personally think they have one time or another, and if they haven't I wonder what their thoughts and reactions would be like to drugs. Oprah did a show about X users, I only saw part of it. Some of them said that it   opened their eyes   and that if they were doing their work and had a mental block, the drug would help their thoughts flow. Oprah was still like   that's very bad  . I guess it is bad, they should learn to let their mind flows without drugs. It's sad if the only was you can open your mind is thru drugs. ",0
1626,"     Today is September 11, 2002. Exactly one year since the attack on the twin towers, the attack on our country occured. Today is a day of sorrow, of mourning, but also a day of pride. As I watched the news today and say story after story of all the people who were killed and of the people who risked their lives to save others I was deeply touched. Atfirst I was sad as I thought about all those who were killed and their families that they left behind. But know, as I have watched as our country has come together, I am extremely proud. I remember at this time last year, American pride was so awesome all across the country. People had their flags out and people just helped each other. People began to think more in terms of our country rather than my country. Today the same thing is happening and many people are uniting to show their pride in their nation, and to remember those that were lost and those that fought for them and lost their lives in the process. I can remember exactly where I was when the second plane crashed. I was in my creative writing class and a girl, Emily Momburger, walked in late talking about how a plane had crashed into one of the twin towers. My teacher turned on the TV and we all watched in awe as it was burning there and people were dyeing. And then out of nowhere the second plane crashed right before our very eyes. We were in shock and I remember I got the chills. I think that I will forever that moment and that feeling inside of me. I remember watching the news as people cried through the streets holding pictures of their loved ones, looking desperately for them all over, just hoping that they weren't in the crash. Today, is a day of remembering though and also a day of forgetting, trying to go on with our daily lives and overcome the terrorism that has overtaken our country.       College life besides the horrific event that we are remembering is going well. I joined TriDelt and am in the greek system. At first I didn't really want to be a tridelt and was disappointed, but now I am really happy. Our pledge class is so amazing and a lot of the girls in it are really cool. We participated in this field day event last saturday and it was really fun. I got to know a lot of the girls better and we bonded. We also went on our pledge retreat that night as well which was a good experience. We were all really exausted but we tried to socialize and get to know each other. Last night I went to this praise and worship thing called Escape. It was at this guys house and there were so many people there. Usually there aren't that many people who go, but last night so many came that we had to go in the backyard. It was awesome even our in the heat. It was so reassuring to see that there are other Christians on this campus and I felt very close to the lord there in that backyard with complete strangers and the dog barking in the background. It is so easy to lose focus here on theis campus, and last night was so helpful for me to really  remember what is really important in this life. I sometimes feel myself getting lost in school and in sorority and greek life, that I'm like I just don't have enough time for my quit times. The fact of the matter is, He should be my number one prioroty, and l;ately he hasn't been. I am working on it though, and we just have to do the best we can. But, I am really excited to be here more and more each and every day. I am meeting so many new people and having so much fun with the old friends that I came here with. We just do th ",0
1457,"Wow, those life savers look really good. hot pockets remind me of Austin powers that's a funny movie. I can't wait to go home. I miss a bunch of my friends there and homecoming will be a ton of fun. hey that guy was in the wonder years. I wish tatiana and I could talk about serious topics for once all we do is jokingly insult each other. Zoo keepers?? we can't be zoo keepers, we have to be a famous hollywood couple. The retreat this weekend is going to be so fun and then we'll get to watch the football game! I hope I'll be able to get some studying done. I really need to do better in Spanish, I'm not doing too well in there. I wonder how my campers are doing. Two of them are online right now. Lunch should be pretty fun today. I'm glad classes are finally over, for this week at least. That guy looks really funny with that blue towel around his head. Where are all those loud guys in our hallway. Saturday Night Live used to be such a funny showwhat happened to it?? Chris Farley was one of the funniest guys around. Tom Arnold was in True Liesthat was a GREAT movie. ",0

Anyway, where was I? Somewhere with more pleasant thoughts. get away from reality - it sucks. Sailor Moon. ai to seigi no, Sailor no Bishoujo Senshi - Sailor Moon! Tsukini kawatte oshioki yo!!! Star sticks became crystal sticks. mercury/Mars/Jupiter/Venus Crystal Power, Make Up!!! Sailor Soldiers theme plays. i hope I'll still have time around here to write my fanfics and my original piece. writing may be just a hobby, or so Mom says, but I'm devoted to  it just the same, and I will keep writing, no matter what; like TV, it helps keep me sane in what seems like an insane world. all these kids and what-used-to-be-kids-a-few-weeks-ago, drinking, screwing around, partying their butts off, struggling through classes, spending all their free time studying; God!!! How can humans live like this?!!? I must write, I must watch television, I must keep my imagination going - I must keep creating my own worlds and immersing myself in them as much as possible while still functioning normally in the outside world. why write fiction, someone once asked? Someone quite succinctly answered, ""Because reality bites!"" I want to be like these people, and yet I do not; but then again, that's the way it is with me, always, isn't it? Human, yet inhuman, helper of men and destroyer of nations, this and that. i am always the great exception, one way or another. Mortal and immortal, good and evil, all abstract opposites do I embrace, and yet none can claim me fully. scientist, warrior, bard, clumsy, ugly oaf. i am what I am. What am I? I am Ronnel. i have been Evan, I have been Ryan, I have been Vance, I have been Vladimir, I have been Ethan, I have been Devon. a million assumed names over what feels like 11 lifetimes (but it's not; I know very well I'm just as mortal and human as the next guy - it's just that sometimes it doesn't feel that way. I guess you have these kind of odd thoughts when you have a world-generating imagination like mine. when you have pride like mine. arrogance like mine. insane and freaky judgment like mine. ""I am a god! I am a god!! Damn you all who say it is not so!!!"" goes a line from a book I've read. my roommate is on the phone again. talking with all of his friends who always call here, while  no one really ever calls me except for Mom, who just calls to nag. not that I mind the solitude, it's just that taking messages and answering phones for someone else and not getting paid $11. 50 an hour for it can get really annoying really fast. He's talking about a friend who lives in a private dorm - I wish I lived in a private dorm. I don't think I'll ever be really happy unless I can have my own house - not a big house, mind you, just one about the size of the one I grew up in. Just my own little castle in suburbia with my own bathroom, my own bedroom, my own closet, my own kitchen, my own TV, my own stereo; a place where I don't have to share and I don't have to worry about what anyone else wants - hell, I want a place where I can go (and stay) and have no problems. No worrying about where my paycheck and financial aid are, where the closest bank is around here, what time I have to be at class, what assignments I have to do. I want to be able to sit around all day and do nothing if I so choose, and have no ill consequences come out of it whatsoever. Yeah, that's a world I'd love - a world with no problems and no ill consequences from anything done. Hmph, how funny - I've just described Sailor Moon's Crystal Tokyo of the 30th century. I want utopia. not a bad wish, when you really think about it, except that when I wished for it, I just wanted it for myself. I've noticed myself become more selfish and arrogant this past year- I wonder how that came out? Ah, well, forget about how - research that when you're in med school or have to write your next psych paper. For now, just condition yourself (whatever name you choose to use this time around) to be a good person, do your best, and keep writing about worlds where the good guys always win, problems can always be solved, and no matter how tragic things get, you can always have a happy ending. ""Oh, what a beautiful dream; if it could only come true, you know, you knowith  what we need is a great big melting pot* Okay, strike that; hate that song.

518,"I feel overwhelmed at the size and population of the school and classes, but at the same time am overjoyed to be here. I spent a year at Stephen F. Austin for my freshman year of college and liked it alright, but the school was not right for me, I think it had more to do with the town than the school, but anyhow I like being in Austin and love being around old friends, but at this moment I feel as if I haven't gotten into the school year just yet. I haven't studied enough and that makes me feel inadequate inefficient, worthless. But I don't dwell on that thought and one of the things which bring me happiness is having my own home this year. Two friends of mine from high school have been rooming together for the last few weeks and there is a lot of freedom involved in having your own place and that brings a lot of comfort to me. Right now I feel relaxed, relieved to be through with classes today. tomorrow is another day and I feel like I have a lot of time to get all my assignments finished. Another comfort for today is getting to finish this assignment. This is the first day I have been able to get into the UGL computer library and luckily I made it in before the deadline. I tried trice before but was rejected each time by some substantial reason which inhibited my using these wonderful machines. These are SO much better than the computers from SFA that I think I shall nut my pants. one other comfort is being able to write freely without impending restrictions from keeping you to a fake writing of what your thoughts are but not really because one is not able to freely express himself through outlawed writing styles, such as uncapitalized letters, lack of punctuation, all borders are allowed to be crossed and I love this freedom. I am feeling very good about myself right now I have just completed my first assignment of the year, well almost completed. I hope I have done this right and this has actually been fun. I look forward to writing on this assignment again. I have 4 more minutes to write I think just to be safe ill keep going a little longer . I am thinking about how this will be graded . I wonder if there could be some way of directly reading what I am writing in real time. and maybe he has hired hundreds of his minions to read just as we write so that they may choose while reading who is doing the right thing and who is not . I think I may stay here all day I like doing work and doing work well I am going to do all of my projects ahead of time so that I may be ahead of all my classes and pass in flying colors. I love school what else do I need to accomplish? I have to sign up for some experiments as well I'd best do that also. I am feeling so stress free right now , very relaxed. I think I have wrote enough but am not sure. so anyway I am the greatest artist on this world and will revolutionize this world in some way in my lifetime. this is my goal to change the world to revolutionize it to be known to be the best at everything to learn to be knowledgeable to be experienced? experienced, and to learn how the brain works is good to, and to learn how the world works , that's good to  I love life who ever does not appreciate life and appreciate the sun rising every morning is insane, I am wishing I had a disk right now to save this stream of coincioussness writing style I like it I am going to do it again, . goodbye I am submitting my work now in a minute three more minutes. I wonder what I will wish I had accomplished when I look back ten years from now. like I look back and wonder when did I think I would be right now ten years ago? hmmm that's ponderous man really ponderous. I am glad to be here rather than home because at home I can not get much done yet it is still such a new experience that I have other priorities ahead of school work there but just there not here and only sometimes. like if kori came over I would never do homework again. yeah.

874,"Today is Labor Day. This weekend I went to my family reunion in Noccona, TX. My cousin, Tracey, is recently engaged. I am extremely happy for her, but at the same time, I am a little bit jealous. I know I am not actually ready for marriage, but it seems so exciting to me. My brother has been married a little more than four years. When he first married, I did not think too much about it. Now, it makes me just a little envious that he has someone to be with all the time. My parents have been married 31 years!  I cannot believe it. In today's world where divorce is a commonplace, I am proud of my parents for sticking together. My parents, about four years ago, agreed to let me have a Yorkie. Her name is Brittnay, and I love her with all of my heart. I was able to see her this weekend, which was so nice. I think I miss her more than anyone else, probably because I get to talk to other people on the phone. Brittnay is the sweetest little princess, and I cannot wait until I see her again. College life is so much different than high school. I t is funny how one grade level (from a senior in high school to a freshman is college) can make such a difference. I really do not feel older. For some reason, I always feel young. When I think about all the petty gossipy things I worried about in high school, it makes me laugh. Once people enter college they change so much. For instance, I have a friend that used to treat girls really badly, but now he is a sincere and honest guy. However, some people change for the worst, which is very unfortunate. I am really concerned about my grades. I really do not know what to expect, as far as exams go; therefore, it is hard to know what to focus on. I want to be a child psychologist. Psychology has always interested me, but the past year, it really has made an impact on me. I love children, and I also love helping people. I figured child psychology was a good way to put the two together. When I become a mom, I want to have a private practice and only work in the mornings. This way, I can spend lots of time with my own children. I also want to make fancy dinners for my husband every night. If I worked all day, I do not think I would have time. This summer I started cooking, and I found that it is quite enjoyable. It is such a good feeling to work hard making something and then share it with others. I would like to take cooking classes sometime during my college years. I also need to find a job. I did not realize how much money college consumes. I feel bad asking my parents for money. Plus, I worked at The Pottery, a local shop in Midland, for a little more than a year, so I am not used to needing money from my parents. My mom and my dad taught me how to manage my monwy. I love my parents/family very dearly. They are the sweetest, kindest, most caring people that I have ever known. My family is also very generous. I just hope that I will turn out to be the kind of people they are. ",1
621,"I haven't been in the mood to do any homework. I find it very hard just to sit down and study. As a Freshmen, I have found many new experiences in the past week. Finally getting my email hooked up, I received my mail that has been sitting in my inbox for about a week. My good friend from home wrote me from South West. She informed me of great news. She is having a ball at her new school. She is on the drill team, and making many new friends. Which leads me to about one o'clock yesterday(sunday). As I came home from church, I was excited to see that I had two messages all for me! :)  The first one is from a friend who attends UT. The other was from my best friend, who sadly is going to another college in Wacol. We could only talk for about fifteen minutes, which wasn't enough time. However, it was long enough so I could hear all about the great time she is having with all of her new friends. Which leads me to the point that I am feeling terribly lonely. I don't mean to sound jealous of my friends good fortunes, but I am envious. See, I came to UT because I didn't want to go to A&M because my brother went there. UT and A&M were the only two schools which I applied. Truthfully, I am not too excited about coming here. However, I don't want to go to A&M. It's so secluded and a good two hours farther from home. Anyway, so I moved up here and moved into an apartment because my mom thinks dorms are too loud. So I have a roommate who is twenty and she does her own stuff and is hardly home!  I am always here all by myself. I have a total of four friends up here. One of which, Heather, I spent all of my senior year bickering with because she never seemed to respect my religious views. She knows how to get under my skin. However, we are closer than any of my other friends up here. Which leads to the final three. Lindsey goes to St. Edwards, and is so homesick. She misses her boyfriend and her mother, which is understandable. Katie is a nice and wonderful, but we haven't spent too much time together, and Sandra. Sandra I've known since the seventh grade and didn't talk to her much my junior and senior years. You see her and Lindsey are best friends and they got in a fight their junior year and stopped talking, so me being the insincere person which I am takes Lindsey's side. My reasoning was because I thought Sandra was inconsiderate of others needs. You see, I had every single class with her our Sophomore year, and we kind of got tired of each other. So back to the present. I don't really know anybody, and I am bad at meeting people because I don't know what to say. Don't think I'm quite or shy because that's far from it, but I just don't know how to go up to people and strike up a conversation. Which leaves me very lonely. It's mainly my fault because I don't want to spend much time with Heather because we just know the right way to almost kill each other. Katie, who is great and there really isn't a good excuse except I don't really feel connected(is that stupid?) Lindsey, who is so homesick that she doesn't want to do anything. And Sandra, who called me yesterday just to talk. Now how nice is that?  I mean, I went to Sandra's today before class, and I had fun. She's nice, not to mention beautiful, skinny, and very smart(very. )  Which I guess why I used to have bad feelings towards her. She's invited me to do stuff with her and her new friends(which she made) but I kind of want to meet my own friends. I group of new friends. Also, Lindsey the homesick one made friends too. Which is good, because she needs to be happy. However, I think it is about time for me to make some friends. Well, also I tried out for the ballet class here. It sucks!  I'm so mad. There are two classes a freshmen class and an intermediate. I was stuck in the freshmen class. It is so bad. I've taken ballet for fifteen years and have been en pointe for eight. Not to mention there is no pointe here!  I am not trying to sound smug, because I was far from being the best at my studio at home. But these girls are beginners, and some of the stuff we are doing is so elementary. Don't get me wrong, I was going to use this to my own benefit and work on techinque, but when the teacher stopped us in the middle of a combination, to tell us were to ""place our arm on the barre""  I almost died. I know where to put it. I don't need help with that. I need help with my turnout, extension, balance!  NOT WITH WERE TO PUT MY ARM ON THE BARRE!  Well, as you can see I am not excactly a happy camper. I'm glad I wrote this, it was fun. My fingers feel like they are going to fall off, but I'm sure I need to get used to that. Well, I'm going home this weekend to go see a ballet my company puts on. It's Peter and the Wolf. We've done it before. It's going to be cute. I was the Duck, my friend Sarah(who goes to South West) was the Bird. She was a great dancer. She was strong and very precise, she danced the lead in the Nutcracker(not Clara, but the Dew Drop)  she shared it with Elizabeth who dance the Cat. Elizabeth is a beautiful dancer she has such grace. She was going to go to Oklahoma on a scholarship, but she ruptured her disc and can't dance for a year, so she stayed home. My other good friend is Ginny, she's a sophomore. She is very good because she was dancing with all of us who are two years older. So those are all of my wonderful friends in ballet. I love ballet, we also have this one dancer named Vanessa, she has extension to die for. That means her leg goes all the way to her ear. She is great. I love ballet, that makes me so happy. Well, thanks for this assignment, I'll see you in class, but I doubt you'll see me!  I'll probably drop by you office sometime!  I hope this makes since! ",0
420,"I am going home for the weekend, and I'm wondering what it will be like after being gone for two weeks. I miss home, my friends, my family, everything about corpus christi. I mean, I'm not sad or anything, but I really cannot wait to get there. I'm thinking of how the bus ride will be on the way home, how it is kind of inefficient to take greyhound because of the schedules and long time that it takes to make a relatively short trip. basically, my mind is not thinking about one specific thing. rather, many thoughts are coming to me during the days here at UT. memories of high school, things I did, things I said, just normal context between me and my friends. after not making longhorn band, I often find myself reflecting on band in high school, the band that we all seemed to always be complaining about, but the band that now seems so great to be a part of. I think about being in it, taking solos in jazz band, and that seems to be where I want to be right now, most of the days, that's where I'd like to be. I think about the solos I took on various songs, the ideas I came up with, and the ones I'm coming up with now; I wish I could be in it to play them, I whistle and hum the different rhythms that I would play, my friend and I try to remember all of the songs that we played last year, and the various experiences that came along with performing. I also am thinking about my family and friends, how I miss them, and how I'm going to them this weekend. I think of how I want to be in corpus, and how to make the weekend last as long as possible. I'm trying to think of what to do there, and whether or not I will get to go to laredo to see the football game for my high school. hopefully so. besides that, I think about my sister in Houston, how she's coming to austin this weekend, and how I'm going to corpus this weekend. but I know that we'll see each other soon. I think about my room at home. the food I'm used to eating in corpus, how I really want to eat there because I'm tired of this dorm food. I try to remember as much about home as I can, but there always seems to be more that I think of later. so much complexity about home; however, when I was there before moving up here, sometimes things seemed to boring, but not now. corpus seems like home, because it is. I just can't wait to be there, and I can't wait to go again, hopefully in two weeks. I also think about my classes here, how I'm wondering how I'm going to do in them, if I'm studying enough or writing down the right things in my notes. I hope that I will do good on my first tests, and I hope that the semester is not too hard as long as I study and keep up with everything. I think of my classes at high school, whether I was that smart or not, I wonder if I'm smart enough to be an engineer, I hope that I do not feel inadequate about myself or start feeling like I'm stupid or something. I think all of these thoughts right now, and like I said, they pop in and out of my mind, with no constant or predictable duration or timing. it almost seems like I'm thinking about everything at the same time, and I guess, various specific thoughts become highlighted or standout every now and then, but while I think about everything I can concentrate on one thing while also thinking about everything else too. other than that, my thoughts are pretty much summed up in this paragraph.

1303,"The walk was refreshing. I should do that more often. I am not sure why not many people take advantage of the beauty of nature and fresh air, and the flowers. My mother loves gardening. We always complain that she spends more time on the garden than on her children. It is just me, my brother and my Dad. Ours is a small family. Not like my neighbors. They have six children. Must be very noisy to live in that family. I like peace and quite when I watch TV or study. I do not think there are any good programs on tonight. I have never watched The West Wing or Will and Grace. Both won the Emmy. They are probably not my type. I just like Friends. This summer there were not any good movies also. Summer really ended so fast. I miss my friend, ""S"". I don't know what it would be like to be at Texas A&M with her. It is a shame she did not get admission at UT. I would have loved to share a room with her. My suite mate is OK. I had lunch with her but we do not have much in common. She is much younger and is in drama. I am in Natural Sciences. I am not sure how I decided on Pre Med. and maybe Business. For the longest time I wanted to be a teacher and my brother told me that it would not make me rich. Money is not everything. Well if I become a doctor, i. e. if I ever pass my MCAT. Why is life so difficult. I wish life was easier and we could do what we wanted. Better still I wish we did not have to grow up and worry about having a family or making money. I think it is getting warm. I need to turn on the AC. My room mate must be cold blooded. I need circulating air. It keeps me refreshed and relaxed. I am not sure why my parents moved to Texas from Canada. I love the snow and the cold. ""T"", my friend in Vancouver, has not replied to my email and she does not even like Instant messaging. I think it is neat that we can do that. I can make friends easily on the net, but face to face is really hard. Everyone thinks I am shy and they are probably true. I had no idea 20 minutes are so long and you can write so much. When I am doing something enjoyable time flies and now it seems that the clock does not move. I need to change this chair. It is so uncomfortable or maybe I can put a pillow on it. I think I will go for another walk after I am done with this. I wander if there is anything good on TV tonight. That fish I ate in the cafeteria is making me sick. I hate the food they serve. I am glad I am going home this weekend. ",1
279,"I am thinking about the pain in my throat right now, I have mono. Soon I will find out whether or not I have strep throat. In fact , I need to call the medical center hotline later, although I guess it really doesn't matter that much because I am already taking penicillin. Last night I could not sleep at all I was in so much pain. I would try and try to forget about the pain, and finally slip of into sleep. But, then about an hour later I would wake up and wish I was dead, not literally, but I just wish the pain would go away. I can deal with feeling sick all the time because I know that will eventually go away. I have so much stuff I need to do still, but I never have the energy to do it. I miss all of my family and sometimes feel lonely, but, I guess that is part of growing up. Texas plays Rudgers this weekend here and I already have my tickets, I wonder what that whole day will be like. I also miss all of my friends from high school, but I got two letters 2 days ago. I always feel sort of lonely at the start of school. Even when I was a little kid I would be really nervous when starting school, but it always ended up getting better by the end of the year. I was so ready to get out of my house this summer, my mom and I argued all the time. But, now I seem to really miss them, I think because I am sick I miss them even more because they have always been there to comfort me when I was sick. I wonder how my brothers are doing, I haven't talked to them in a couple of weeks. Everything here at UT is overwhelming, the system just doesn't seem to care about me. The people here are nice, but the red tape is difficult to cut through. I hope I can actually make good grades in my Calculus class, which is really hard. I guess  I need to get a tutor and work on not putting my assignments off to the last minute. Computers are really interesting. They seem like part of the ""system"" and red tape involved in everything. Not that I don't appreciate or like technology, It just isnÃ¯Â¿Â½t personal at all. I need people around me in order to feel good and have fun, that is why I think I miss my family, they were always there to talk to. I know I can graduate from college, but I sometimes wonder whether or not I really can. I also wonder about the many paths my life could take. Will I be truly happy in the future? Will somebody love me enough to marry me?  Will I ever find a person I want to marry. What job will I have, how much money will I make. Will I be as successful as my Dad?  Can I live up to all of the expectations of my family?  Sometimes I see answers to these questions, I don't know how, and what are these visions, are they just part of my imagination?  I feel like time is passing and I am not really making an impact. ",1
1925,"well, here I am. writing this essay. ok sorry that was a bit corny. you know. well I just got done taking my first college test in chemistry. it wasn't too bad I guess. but the fact that I stayed you till 2:30 in the morning didn't help much. last night I went to a place called posse. it's a bar that a lot of the people in the band go to. I had a blast! of course I drove and so I had to drive back which wouldn't have been so bad except that it was raining last night. I have a C parking permit. yeah. it's the one that makes you park across the interstate. can you see me running across the interstate soaking wet? it wasn't too much fun. but I got here and got my materials, and started studying in my soaking wet clothes (I had to stay clothed cause I was in my hallway. my roommate was asleep and I didn't want to wake him up. ) I studied a bit, and then got kinda bored with it so I went and got my guitar and played it out in my hallway. I'm pretty sure I broke some rule about quiet hours, but it didn't seem to bother anyone. I was quiet and the songs were soft and pretty. I like to play guitar before I go to bed. it helps me wind down. actually I like to play the guitar anyways. it's such a chick magnet. I have gotten a lot of play just cause I can play the guitar. it's nice. and it's therapeutic. playing guitar that is. I would expect getting booty is pretty therapeutic in some way, but that's not what I'm talking about. it helps me with my problems. I'm not too sure how. well, I guess it just helps me express my emotions and get them out of my system. I like it anyways. I love music. not only listening to it, but performing it as well. I'm in the longhorn band! now that kicks total ass! I mean it's huge, it's a lot of fun, and we get into all the games for free! and actually, this is the best part, WE GET PAID TO GO TO THE OU GAME! YES, THAT'S RIGHT, THEY GIVE US MONEY TO GO TO THE OU GAME! I love thinking about that. all those poor kids with their bracelets. oh well. such is life. I love football too! and what better place to go than here! our football team kicks ass!@! ok. so I don't know where to go from here. hmm. I guess I could talk about how weird it is that when we're asked to think about anything the first thing we do is well, not really think. ya know? is that due to nervousness? is it just some bad habit that teenagers and adults of late have acquired? who knows. I was talking to a friend in your class and she said that she was going to have a hard time wetting this. I think this is pretty easy. I'm fairly scatterbrained so it's cool. I've been noticing this more and more lately. I know I don't have add or anything, but I find myself being absent minded every once in a while. I wonder if add is a real thing. I mean I never really disputed it, but I have friends that think that add is a problem of will power. but who knows. alright. 4 minutes left. what shall I write about for 4 minutes. I'm sure there are some other ramblings I could think of. I play the sax. yeah. I like it. my biology class sucks, both of them really. my 212 is better than my 211 but who cares. I guess I should learn to like them though cause biology is my major. I want to go premed. and become a surgeon. we'll see how that goes I guess. if I don't make it in that, I'll probably switch to music. it would be nice and a music degree from UT has literally a 100% job acceptance rate. that is no lie. and that's a really good deal. we have a great music program here. we also have an awesome social life here. there's always something to do and someone to talk to . ooooooooooohhhh! less than a minute! almost through! what should I write!?!?! I don't know! oh I know! I'll write about   ",0
1368,"Well then where do I begin. Let's see. I need a haircut. I should have gotten one when I went home labor day weekend. But I didn't. I wanted to go home this weekend, really only so I could get a haircut, but I didn't. My hair is getting entirely too long. At least for me it is too long, I mean I don't have a pony tail or anything but still. I forgot to see when I started writing. Oh well I'll just estimate. I really need to get a cell phone. Of course I would turn it off in my psychology class unlike some dumb asses in there. I mean how stupid do you have to be to not check and see if your phone is on even after the professor tells you to make sure they are off. I suppose they might leave it on once or forget they have it in their backpack or perhaps their friend put their phone in their bag and forgot about it, but it can't help but kind of piss you off when a phone rings in class. All I think is, ""what a dumb mother fucker. "" Hey look, Microsoft word doesn't recognize the word fucker. Hey it doesn't even recognize the word Microsoft. My head itches. Because my hair is too long. I need to go to the optometrist and get new contacts. I think I've had these for over a year now. I'll probably get them the same color, aqua. Man it is hot outside, it must be about 98 degrees. Not that I am any good at estimating but hey. Like I can't estimate a girls weight worth a shit. Or a person's age. Of course if a guy is smart, he doesn't try to estimate a girls weight. I need to go to the restroom. My stomach is growling. Man my nose is itching too. I miss Jenn. Damn she is beautiful. I wonder if she's thinking about me right now. She is probably in 7th period right now, whatever class that is for her. I wonder if she is pregnant. If she is it's probably mine. Great, just great. I'm fucked. Then again that's what got me in this position in the first place. Speaking of positions, I wish Jenn was here now. I want to go home this weekend. Not so I can go home this weekend, but so I can get a haircut and see Jenn. I wish I had my car so I could just go wherever I wanted whenever I wanted. Then I would probably be out partying and stuff all the time. ",0
527,I don't really know what I should write about. I guess I'm feeling alright. My class was cancelled for today so I had the whole day off. I rented Sling Blade which I liked the movie had people with psychological problems like the guy who is always talking about women he killed and the main character who cuts peoples heads open every once in a while if he feel s it is necessary. The keyboard on the computer sucks since the space bar key keeps on sticking whenever I try to push it down. I am kind of nervous about classes because last semester I screwed up grade wise after keeping an almost 4. 0 GPA for 2 and 1/2 semesters. I have never taken psychology before in high school and I wish I had since it would make the class easier now when I take it. I really can't type continuously for twenty minutes without having a definite subject so I keep having to stop and think of something to type. One of my goals this semester is to stop watching TV so often because that is what I feel screwed me up last semester since I was always staring at the screen either their or while surfing the web. Now I beginning to feel a little grossed out because I was just thinking about our dorm meeting where they told us housekeeping comes in only every other day to clean the bathroom when they used to come every day and it was still pretty dirty now it is going to be even worse. I guess it has been about twenty minutes now I forgot what time I started typing at since I forgot to write it down I thought I would have remembered. So I'm just going to call it a night. ,0
1159,"I have no idea how to start this, so I'm just going to start typing and discover what happens!. I just got off the phone with my boyfriend, Keil. I miss him a lot, a whole lot. We've just been going out for 8 months last Saturday, but it feels like we've been together forever. I can't imagine my life right now without him. He still lives at home, near Houston, and I don't get to see him as often as I would like, but if it's meant to be it will be. It will be hard, definitely, but it should be worth it. He tells me all the time how he loves me, and how he will marry me. He even asked me last week, well not officially, but he did ask me what I would say if he asked me to marry him right then. I had no clue what to say I was really confused. I'm so unsure of what to do. I miss him so much it's unbelievable. Sometimes I wish I had stayed home to go to college because it's going to be so hard for the next 4 years, maybe 5. All of my friends love him and his friends love me, it's almost too perfect, if that is possible. His parents are my parents and his brother and I have become very close and get along great. I can imagine having them as inlaws. I was always brought up knowing that you never get along with your inlaws, but I don't see how that could happen. This weekend my roommate and I are going home. We've grown up together. I've known her since the second grade and we've been close friends since seventh. I'm glad that I know her. I don't see how people can come to a place like this and get a roommate they've never met before. That would have added a lot of stress to my life. Not like I don't already have enough stress. Actually, college hasn't been as stressful as I imagined it to be. However, I'm sure that will all change as soon as we start having exams and finals. ugh. I'm not looking forward to that! I've always been the kind of person to put more stress in my life than is needed. A couple of my friends pick on me saying I ""freak out too easily"". But it doesn't feel like it to me. I don't know, maybe they're right! I was raised an only child, until recently. My mother and biological father divorced when I was four and my mom remarried the man I call dad when I was six. My stepfather has 2 sons and one daughter (who is my age). But, they never lived with us they would spend the occasional weekend at our house but not very often was it longer than a weekend. My entire life changed about 2 months ago when my stepbrother Trey moved in. He took over my life. It was crazy. Suddenly he had all of the attention. I know I sound like a jealous brat, but really he did. Not even just from my parents, suddenly he was my boyfriend's best friend. I could not get away from him. I have worked for my dad's company for 3 years, and then all of a sudden he started working there too. My entire life changed in the past 2 months. I gained a brother, left home for college, lost some friends by leaving, gained some friends by coming, and I am now living a totally different lifestyle. ",0
414,"Its really cool being able to see all of my friends and hang out. Yet, I feel like I'm somewhat out of place. It was really strange coming home yesterday. As soon as we came into town, it felt like I was in some kind of mirage. It was like I was dreaming and it still feels that way. I really need to do a lot of homework but I don't think I'm going to get a whole lot done, considering the circumstances. I went to our high school football game last night. Wow, was that strange. I saw some old friends and it just felt so strange. Its going to be even worse going back, because now that I've seen everybody I somewhat want to stay. But, on the other hand I need to go back, have to go back, and I do want to go back. I've met people and I still want to meet more people. I've had a lot of fun down there, and so I want to go back. I have too much homework now. Uhhh, that sucks. Well, the UT football game is on and they're already losing!  I guess it is UCLA, but come on guys. Oh well, I guess I'm supposed to be talking about my college experience. So, anyway, I don't know, I'm getting adjusted pretty well to the university. I love the campus. Absolutely, love it. The buildings, especially in the six pack, and with the view of the capital and the tower is just amazing. I'm from Dallas and the Austin area is just so much nicer and I feel so much safer. There's not a lot of places like that up here, but it seems like everywhere in Austin is like that. I've been down to the river, and it its so much better than our river up here, the Trinity. And the lakes in Austin are so clean and nice. Plus, there's so much to do. Which, is also somewhat of a bad thing, since its harder to get my work done with so much going on. Something that does seem really weird is that I can actually study better in my dorm room than I could in my own room here at home. I guess because I realize that in college, I'm paying for my education, so I'm taking it a lot more serious. I can't screw around now, and I actually do find myself wanting to learn. Surprise!  I actually sit in class and listen to the professor. I have a lot more respect for the teachers down here because I know that they know what they're talking about and I want to learn more. The whole is experience is so much different and better than high school, in my opinion. Coming back home, and seeing friends still in high school; I feel sorry for them. High school was fun and all, but college is fun, and I feel I'm getting a quality education. Plus, in high school, there's way too many people who just don't want to be there. And they have to act so stupid for some reason, and it was just extremely annoying. In college, everyone who's there is there because they want to be there. So, they're aren't people who just want to cause trouble and act stupid all the time. Food. What is the deal with the food at Jester?  I mean some of its good, but the main course is always terrible. Its cold and looks like something has infested it. But, to be fair, there is some good food, every once in a while. Home food. Now, there's a big difference. Mmm. Got to love it. That's got to be the best thing about coming home, at least one of them. Also, not having to worry about money is a great thing. I'm getting along great with my roommate. I had heard about all of these horror stories about roommates, so I was a little worried at first. But, I usually get along with most everybody, so I figured it would probably be ok. And it was. He's normal and listens to the same music as me. We're getting to be pretty good friends. The only thing I'm worried about now is the tests. Everyone keeps telling me that no matter how much I study some times I'll still fail. That worries me. I would like to think that if I know the material then I would pass the test. And so far, I really haven't had that much homework to do. I have had to read a lot, but I haven't had much writing work to do. I think I'm running out of things to talk about, or rather, think about. But, well, its been twenty minutes, and I guess I understand what this was all about. Plus, the UT game is on, and hopefully we can somehow, with the grace of God, pull off a win. I think that may be impossible though, so maybe then we can get some kind of close loss. Man, we are getting killed. Oh well, next week we get to play Kansas St. !  And they're only like, what, 5th in the nation. That's not so great right?  Out defense just plain sucks. I mean, I don't think I've ever seen such bad plays as what I'm seeing right now. But, hey, we've got Ricky though, so maybe he can pull off some kind of miracle. Yeah, its going to be one of those games that goes down in history because we came back and won. There, that's positive thinking. I think that's what the team needs the most. And if football can't do that great, we've still got some other great athletes in some other great sports. That's the great thing about UT, we've got so many sports that something's got to be good. And I love how there's like an organization for everyone, so that everybody fits in. The organizations are great because they make you feel more at home. You're able to be with people that you feel comfortable with. Ok, its been like way past twenty minutes so I guess I'm through. Uh, bye, I guess. ",0
1413,"There are many things that have been bothering me lately. I feel as if I have been betrayed by those that should be absolutely loyal. It is sad that people must always interfere in the things that make you happy. It is as if other people sense when you are content and are trying to steal your happiness out from under you. I have made many new friends that I know will be there for me for many years to come. I feel as if I am part of a sacred family that always supports and protects those that it calls its own. Well, that family has just been defiled by the actions of one. Even though I am not perfect myself, by any means, I always try to do my best when it comes to keeping promises. I am afraid to see what may come of this action. The consequences could be severe indeed if we are found to be guilty of this false accusation. I do not understand what could possess another person to want to place his family in jeopardy just for the sake of conversation. I am deeply saddened by this recent turn of events and I hope and pray that everything will work itself out and that my family will survive and be able to grow into the future. I am prepared to accept the consequences of the actions of my brothers; that is what makes us a family. We have already grown beyond the notion of selfishness and are prepared to assist our family members in any situation, even if it means that we will suffer greatly for actions that were not ours to commit. This new family means the world to me. After leaving my home I felt alone and afraid until I found a group of friends so loyal and so trustworthy that I immediately felt at home again. I will do anything to see that my new family is not harmed or defiled in any way. I believe that it is necessary to have a strong support group to succeed, not only as a student, but as a human being. I am prepared to lay down my selfish tendencies for the good of my family. It is the least I can do. I love my new family as much as my old family. I refuse to see it be destroyed. ",1
367,"Realizing that I am on my own left to create a future all by myself is a responsability which excites me. Everyday, I open my eyes and look around the room to see my roommate ( a perfect stranger only a few weeks ago) eating her daily breakfast and I have to hit myself just to make sure that my life is a reality. I have waited so long for college, for freedom for independence and now I posses all these things. And as excited as I am, I also ponder in thoughts of dissapointment. Not in myself or my actions but in all I have left behind. Yes I am talking about my family and friends and my own room and homemade meals, but I am also talking about my childhood and innocence. Ok, go with me for a little bit--- I know it's cheesy and a little extreme but it's true. I am on my own now, making all (well actually most) of my decisions on my own. I don't have my mom yelling at me to stop talking on the phone or to start doing my homework. My teachers aren't there to take role call or to ask you how life is treating you. All those thing that I took for granted but were a daily part of my life. Don't get me wrong, I love the freedom of college and the fact that I can talk for hours without my mom yelling at me or the fact that my teachers won't call  my mom if I happen to skip class. I really don't know where I'm going with this, all I can offer as an explanations is that just because a freshman loves their new found freedom does not always mean that they don't miss their old life. It's hard growing up and facing up to the challenges of responsibility. I am often tempted to call my parents and beg them to send me a homemade meal or to remind me to set my alarm clock so I don't oversleep. Yet, I should confess that so far, I am handeling the whole responsability thing quite well. One thing I  certainly enjoy is the fact that I can spend more time with my friends and I can go out on weekdays and I can eat unhealthy food as much as I want. Not to say that I indulge myself in such activities constantly. I guess the point of it all, is that I am confused. I am trying to find out who I am. And I think college can bring such valuable experinces as to help you understand yourself a little more. Throught the lonly moments, and the paries and the classes, through it all, I think that we are all supposed to learn a little about ourselves as well as others and the world surrounding us. Oh, and ofcourse, to get and education.  ",0
1966,"I'm currently thinking about what I just finished writing to Dr. Pennebaker about, my broken relationship. It was so beautiful, and the worst part is that the feeling, that beautiful feeling is still inside me. I feel it everyday: in class, before I go to bed, when I wake up. I remember the feeling of being with him, and I miss it. I miss him so much. I hate having taken him for granted. I hate the fact that things could have worked out, had I simply admitted to myself that I had fallen for a guy. That's all I needed to do. All I could do was ignore him, laugh at him, all this while trully knowing there was something else. I did all of this knowing that I meant none of it. I was fighting it! I was doing what my three older brothers had instilled in me from time of birth, All guys are the same. They're all jerks. Be careful who you fall in love with. Don't fall in love in high school, it's too soon. You have your whole life ahead of you. "" I knew they were only trying to protect me, I knew they were saying this because they themselves having  been guys, knew what it is guys were after. But no, not Hugo! He was different. He wasn't horny or all over me, or asking me weird sex stuff. Not once did he do this. Not once did he push me into something I didn't want to do. Not once! We dated for a year, and the most he got out of it to brag to his football friends was that we held hands and we kissed each other on each other's foreheads and cheeks. This was it. And God did he do stuff for me. I hated saying I needed something or felt a certain way in front of him, because he had always go out of his way to help-ALWAYS! For Valentine's Day, he designed a shirt that said, ""Monica, Will You Be My Valentine?"" I remember that morning, walking into the school and knowing that he was going to do something, knowing he wanted to celebrate such a special holiday with me. I hugged him, nodded, and smiled. That was all he needed. I don't know what I wouldn't do to have those feelings all over again-with him!?! I dream about laying beside him, while he has his arms wrapped around my shoulders. and just watching him breathe, watching his chest rise and lower, as he breathes. WOW! Such an amazing sight. Now, all I have are our memories, most of them of me being a 'bitch' to him, treating him so unfairly. Maybe he does deserve better than me, maybe this is all part of God's plan. But you see,  I know God knows me and he knows I have a big heart, but am just afraid to show it. He knows this. He knows how sometimes, it's hard for me to show my true feelings for fear of loss or rejection, or something or other. But what now? Should I wait? I guess so. Deep down, I have this feeling that it is not over between Hugo and I by a long shot. I know it's not over by a lot. I remember how Hugo treated his parents, better than I've ever seen  anyone treat their parents, with such respect and love. I've always had this thing that a  guy will treat his wife the way he treats his mother. His Dad also, that man is really such a good person. He really does have a lot to offer to his family, and I know Hugo too is this type of person. I only hope he knows this about himself. I only hope he knows everything he is worth. I only hope that he knows how I truly feel about him, how I've truly felt about him this entire past year. I hope he knows that behind every crude and hateful action or word,  there was an enormous amount of love just trying to get through. There was an enormous amount of love just trying to beat all the hate, and although it might have been a little late, it has been released. It has gone through all the hate. It lives in  me today, right now, right this instant as I am typing, and will live in me for a very long time, if not-eternally. ",0
2205,"I've been thinking a lot lately on the topic of studying other people, using them as test subjects, objectifying human beings, I really feel that it degrades their very being. I don't understand another human's need to study and examine what makes another human tick. I wish that I could say that I am exempt from this curiosity, but sadly I am not. I find myself hypocritically fascinated by the way that people lose themselves in their jobs, in causes, in religion. They somehow manage to pound it into their heads that whatever it is that they're involved in is important, means something, when in reality 100% of professions and causes are just as pointless as the lives of the people lost in them. None of it will rally matter once these people are gone, and the strange thing is that I think they all know this deep down, they've all had that thought in their life before. Yet they still go on, slaving their lives away, building the modern day pharaoh's modern day pyramids. Just pawns to those that were lucky enough to be born into wealth. God only knows what they would do if they were forced to face the reality of their banal situations. Which raises another good topic, religion, now everyone knows that religion is make-believe for grown ups, just another thing to keep perpetuating the myth that our lives matter in some deep and profound way. Religion as we know it was made to control the masses, sort of a justification for law, and also something that keeps people inline above law, like a conscience. But the religions that we have come up with are so ridiculous we have to implement them to our young at ages when they are too young to tell the difference between real and fake. We teach them religion as fact when they are too young to differentiate for themselves the difference between fact and fiction. It's funny that we act as if what religion we pick matters, as if one is even different that the others, they all have the same common goal to keep people living in the hierarchy, keep believing that by divine right the rich were born to a life of comfort and luxury and the poor must suffer in order for rich to have such pleasant lives. In tribal societies religion doesn't have to be forced on the new generation, rather they welcome it with open arms, just as they aren't forced to work in their lives, rather they do it out of necessity and a primal urge to conform to your own society. People allowing themselves to be controlled really bothers me, it's clear that people can live, sustain life, off very little, and will slave their lives away rather than die. However I can't comprehend how our society got to this point, where the slave drivers now wear a smile while fucking people in the ass. We somehow fib ourselves into believing we need cell phones, computers, tv's, cars, when it's a fact that none of these things even existed 50 years ago. People actually lived without any of this bullshit for 3 million years, people just like you and me, people just as smart, and just as naive. It's clear that society breeds evil not the other way around, the pilgrims committed mass genocide on the indians, but it is forgiven as they were just spreading the one right way to live, that we have so enlighten found. People lived without all this none-sense that we tell ourselves we couldn't live without for nearly 3 million years. But those are all things that no one wants you to know, except maybe Daniel Quinn, Derrick Jensen, John Zerzan, and Chuck Palahniuk. Those are the men that will save our planet and our existence if it isn't already too late. The doomsday clock is set to 40 years from now, that is the point of no return, if things stay the way that they are now, there will be no hope for the future. If we had all just stayed with animism, and believed that the earth is not something for us to own, or control, if we would acknowledge that we are the weakest animal alive in that we are totally and utterly dependent on other animals giving their lives so that we may survive, how could we take away their right to the same land we live on. But there are no classes teaching what people really want to know, what they need to know, only classes perpetuating our way of life. Only classes brainwashing the brainwashed so suddenly that we don't even notice. So why study me when there are billions of other mindless zombies in this world. Now I realize that my writing may sound bleak, as if I'm in a state of utter depression, that I'm innately sad, but it's my very strong belief that with the world the way it is everyone should, and deserves to feel the depression that haunts us all. We keep on trying to come up with ways to hide from ourselves the atrocities being carried out everyday by white collared crooks, making executioner executive decisions. But humans shouldn't need pills to control their feelings, they shouldn't need pills to make them happy, they shouldn't need pills to force their inner feelings into submission. It pains me very deeply to see the day to day transfer we are making into a controlled society, and the people that don't see it, if it isn't already here. Our phones are tapped, our emails are spied on, the government we live under even monitors what books we are checking our in order to make sure were not reading anything that could be dangerous. People wake up everyday and take zoloft, prosac, ritalin, adderol, valium, zanex, anything that will keep them from deviating from what is considered acceptable behavior, to keep them inline. Anything to keep them from focusing on how ridiculous it all is, anything to keep them so fucked up they just don't care anymore. Anything to hide the fact that the light at the end of the tunnel has gone out, there is no hope for the future we are writing now, at least none that includes us. For a species that holds it self in such hich regard, the top of the food chain, the center of the universe, in our own special classification, we sure act stupidly. If we were to open our eyes we'd see that the real criminals are the rich old men living in their mansions, with drugged up kids, both pharasudically, and illegally, allowing oppression, deforestation, slavery, pollution, and the lot to continue everyday, infact they make sure it grows, because you can't stop progress. They are very rapidly destroying any traces of another way of life with every indigenous tribe they try to save"" by spreading the word of a god that allows his people to be in a constant state of submission, so that they may enter an endless world of happiness once their life here is over. I'm here to tell you that no such place exists, god is just santa clause for adults. Where was god when the twin towers were hit, where was god when the indians were wiped out by the white man, where was god when the germans were killing the jews, where is god now when people are so cleverly brainwashed since the time they are born that they don't even notice when they're doing it to their own children. I for one would hate to be responsible for bringing another life into this god forsaken waste land. Everyday we scorch the earth with new roads, we rip the earth apart for new buildings, we destroy the earth for a made up monetary system. No one seems to see the bull shit that is going on here, before civilization no one had to work, in fact tribal people have no concept of work, they do what they have to in order to survive and they spend the rest of their time living, doing whatever it is that they want to. We have some how been duped into believing that this way of life is unacceptable, lazy, pointless, a waste, yet we fail to see that our way of life is just as pointless, just as wasteful. Only we have to lie to ourselves and children right from the day they are born, because the way we live is so heinous, so vile, so wrong that our children can't handle it, and for the most part neither can we. We could change everything in one generation, if we all started living a different way one day the whole system would collapse on itself, but we lie to ourselves and force our own minds to believe that this is right, that this is the way things must be and that there's nothing we can do about it.

2392,"I'm actually really tired, but I want to finish as much homework as I possibly can. It's not terribly late so I thought it would be nice to write something on my thoughts right before I go to bed. Today was a good day. Not too much stress and I talked to a lot of my friends and family. Its always nice when I get to talk to old friends from hs. today I met a girl that went to the same elementary as me. we didn't know each other, but we had a connection because we were from the same town. MOst people have never heard of my town before, so it was pretty cool. I also met a girl this morning that went to the other hs in my town, which again is strange. I actually met a lot of people, one of the girls has a class with me and we live right down the hall from each other. I'm glad to know that I have someone that I can study with or ask a question if I need help anytime I want. One good thing about college is that it's really easy to make friends. Even if you're a shy person, there's always someone who is willing to talk to you. I used to be really shy, but I don't have much of a problem introducing myself to random people, I actually enjoy doing that now. I look foward to those that I will meet tomorrow, I just hope I can remember everyone's name when I see them again. I've met so many people in such a short period of time that it becomes difficult to match names with faces. I enjoy all of my classes, I'm feeling pretty comfortable in my decision on what I plan to major in. It seems that I really do enjoy chemistry and biology, but I'm really glad to have a psychology class to take my mind off of things that I have to do. I'm really excited about Wednesday. I'm going to try out for the rowing team. I think I'm really going to enjoy the workouts and meeting new people. I hope I make the team, but I don't want to get my hopes up, so I'm just going to see how it goes. Today I went to the gym to see how difficult rowing really is and I feel much more comfortable with my decision. I was able to row correctly, although it gets kind of confusing at times because it is not a natural movement. but I was able to row for 2000 meters non-stop my first try, and I think that's pretty good because I only have to row for 500 meters for the tryouts. I'm not sure how good my chances are at making the team. I haven't been on a sports team since middle school. but I have been in band since sixth grade. band may not be the best workout ever or the most strenuous, but marching can get pretty tiring, and I think that it has prepared me a little for this. I'm really good with endurance which is key in rowing. In high school, we had to march for 8 minutes straight. my senior year I had a solo and I had to run around to my different sets and then stand still and play a long slow balad for a couple of minutes and make it musical. That was pretty hard to play without people realizing I'm completely out of breath. But it was really rewarding, I had the opportunity to play in front of thousands at a time at our football games. I could never get up in front of a crowd and speak or sing, but I can play my flute in front of anyone. I really wish I was able to be in the UT band. I had always wanted to be part of the band, but now my major doesn't allow the time. I hope that later in my college career, I have the chance to be in the marching band at least once. I think it would be so much fun. Music has always been a big thing in my life, I love to play it, but I also love to listen to it. My favorite kind of music is country. I especially love george strait. I have most of his cd's. I know every word to every song he sings, I only need to hear the first chord of one of his songs and I'll know its him. I'm also a big fan of 80's movies. one of my favorites is young frankenstein. mel brooks makes wonderful movies, I think they're all hilarious. real genius is another good one I like. most of my favorite movies I'm able to quote from beginning to end. one of the classics is the princess bride. there are so many great one-liners in that movie. my dad and I always say random quotes from movies anytime something happens. my dad knows the most trivial things. he'll know the answer to the most random question you can think of. its pointless, but its pretty cool. my dad and I are really close, I wish I could be more like my dad. we grew really close when my mom passed away when I was little, he remarried, and now I have a brother and a sister. I love my little sister so much, she's the cutest. she never uses my real name, she always calls me sister. I really miss her. but I talk to her often and she's always so excited to hear from me. she just got a new rabit, she's had 5 and three of them were sold in the stock show and one of them died. but now she has 2. I hope the heat doesn't get to these two like the others. she's always really worried about them. she also has a dog, and I have a dog named princess. my dog is a choc. lab. she's really cute, but she's also really old. I'm glad she has a new puppy to play with since I won't be there for her all the time. I've had her ever since I was little, I miss her too. I brought a lot of pictures and things from home so I wouldn't get homesick. my room is very comforting I think. I don't think I could stand it if it were blank. most of my pictures are of my family and of my best friend kelly. she goes to corpus with my brother, so she isn't that far away from me. we talk all the time online though, so it feels like she's here.

1779,"Why am I doing this? I don't feel like typing for 20 minutes. this is bound to be very boring. i'm already bored. i still have way too much time to kill. I'm really hungry. haven't had breakfest yet. i need to finish my homework though. I want to go out this weekend. my brother is also coming into town. I'm still bored. As usual, a song pops into my head when iu am really bored. I'm wearing no pants right now. its somewhat drafty. i'm going to look out my window now. no one is outside. i want some fresh air but i still have 16 minutes to go. I really should have taken a shower before i started this. Still hungry. my roomate is studying. i feel like bothering him. i just got offered a single room but i'm not taking it. I really want to listen to some music while i do this but  i can't.  we're not going to make it    pops into my head. I''m now going to stare at the poster on my wall. I really should throw out the  trash and make my bed. I still have to read my psychology textbook before i leave for my next class. I also need to workout. I need to learn out to type 80 words a minute. damn my fhand hurts. sucks to have tendonitis in both hands. 12 minutes to go and still extremely bored. I'm reaching my angry stage right now. I want to eat and i have to kill 11 more minutes, Might as well try some meditation. still have yet to decide if i want to finish my work before i go out tonight or if i do. I need to go meet someone tonight so i guess i better work. hey at least i'm halfway through. it would suck to be in prison. Now i jsut got a random word in my head. disestablishmentariasm. well then moving on. considering my week, its been pretty awful. I almost got mugged, someone got arrested for dealing drugs nearby me on that same night, and i accomplished nothing. i need to become more motivated. not going to school for a year does that to you. I really need to go learn judo. my sheets are looking pretty messy. i must go fold them in 7 minutes. i need to organize my books to and buy some new laundry detergent. Well if i am going to waste my time writing for 20 minutes i might as well make a shopping list. yesterday i watched orange county it was pretty amusing. then i went and did   dance dance.  yeah i really suck at that game. I really have almost nio hand to eye coordination. no wonder i took up pool recently. almost 5 minutes left. i think i should have made myself some green tea before starting this. eh i might go skip the crappy lunchs they serve at the cafeteria and go use my  5 bucks at pizza hut. i like pizza hut. its better than a lot of pizza chains. no pizza beats this one pizza place in greenwich connticut. i used  to walk a a mile to get to eat it when i was `10. those were the days. man my trash is full. i wish we could open our window. this room has a weird smell. must be all the ants i killed. stupid dorm  is infested. i want to go play some pool today. i've been practicing for 3 months straight to beat my brother at it. He took me for some money last time and this time i will dominate. well enough with my  evil plans (insert dr evil laugh). i have 2 minutes remaining and i am still very bored. i need to go take my vitamins. i think i need to buy some good cologne all the after shave i use isn't quite that great. It burns like hell especially since i hate to shave. if there was electrolysis for the face i would do it. well only 30 seconds left. i better save this in case it somehow gets deleted. it turned out to be somewhat fun. well not really. and i'm done.

1462,"I guess I'll just start out by explaining how I feel right now. Because of school, I've been feeling really stressed. Although because of our class I'm not really sure what stress is. To me stress is when I have a lot to do and no time to rest and relax. I haven't been getting as much sleep as I usually do at home, but it doesn't ever feel late at my dorm because everyone's up late. I feel like my whole life is school right now. I live on campus, don't have a car here with me to get away from campus and my classes are spread out all during the day. By the time I get to my dorm in between classes I have to leave in 30 minutes to get to another class 15 minutes away. The days have been going by really fast though. I'm always so busy. I try to just get my work done during the week so I can go out on the weekend and have fun. I'm really excited about college because already I've learned so much. I feel like I'm being able to think better about things. Or I guess maybe deeper about things. Not just school related stuff but stuff about life as well. I've begun to think more about what I want and what type of person more about my opinion on things. I guess you sort of have to be like that at UT, because there are so many people. In high school no one really expressed themselves like the do in college. A lot of the classes push that during the discussion times I guess because the classes are so large. Our psychology class is bigger than my graduating class in high school, and everyone else I talk to have an even smaller class than I did. It's really weird but I keep seeing the same people in a lot of classes. I know of 5 people that are in 3 of my classes. Maybe it's just that I recognize them. I still don't really know what to expect from my classes. Most of them seem interesting except for Calculus and Economics. I really like the experiments we do in class. Ugh, I can't think of anything else to write about. I hope this is the way we were supposed to write this. Actually it's helped me relax and get out some of my feelings even though no one will read this. So I guess it's sort of like a journal. I actually don't feel as stressed now that I've gotten this done. It's one less thing I have to worry about. Now I have to figure out how to copy and paste it. I'm not very good with computers. ",1
2291,"Wow, I have some pizza stuck in my tooth. Aw, why did that song have to end, it was good. the AC is really loud. Man, I like shrek 2. tonight, I'm breaking the habit tonight, I like Kelly Clarkson, she's so talented. man, I'm so bad at spelling. I haven't heard this, oh, yeah, it's by clay aiken, or maybe it isn't. Oh well. Ozarka Natural Spring. It was probably from Fort Worth, I'm from Denton about thirty miles north of Dallas. I saw Jenny a couple days ago. She's got curly hair. Movie Night, um I don't know. I'm supposed to by typing what I am thinking. I'm talking with Victoria my roommate. She is wearing a hat. I have a hat just like it. It's in my closet on top on a shelf. Victoria is leaving now. I shall say bye to her. Ok, now that that is over. I am going out to lunch with this girl from Christians on Campus. Sounds like it would be fun. Her name is Joselyn and she just graduated, I think from this college in Boston but she is here for just the semester. Only 4 minutes have gone by. Wow, this is taking forever. I have chemistry oops, mistake. I don't like commercials on the radio, why couldn't they just play music commercial free. My folder is blue. I finished all my psychology reading (all of chapter three). I learned way too much info on the nervous system. It is going to take forever to study for the test. I'm glad there is a lot of info in the chapter though, because I'm going to med school and will need that info. I keep making typos probably because I'm typing too fast. Oh, I have ice-cream in the freezer. Mmmm. It is a blue bell ice cream sandwich. I like Wendy's. Ah, yay, another commercial free hour of music. YAY. I like Avril Lavigne. My Happy Ending is a good song. Everyone criticizes her for not being ""punk enough. ""  I laugh at how much time people spend criticizing artists. They should just appreciate the music. I think by saying that I was being a hypocrite because I was criticizing the people who criticize. Does admitting that you are a hypocrite make you a hypocrite. Deep, huh?  I'm wearing contacts. I like my sunglasses. They are on top of my head because it is pointless to wear contacts indoors. Wow, I am only have way done. Hey, maybe that means I'm optimistic. I am such a bad speller. I spend way to much time thinking about school. I'm such a nerd. Everyone else goes out and parties and I stay in the dorm and study for hours and hours. But I do tend to watch a lot of TV, wait, I haven't been watching much TV during this past week at UT. Only about 1 hour per day. I'm so proud of myself. I can't believe that I haven't procrastinated this assignment. I don't like this trend of girls wearing too short skirts. I guess I'm just too conservative and wear long jeans or caprice. I bought new caprice. My mom just washed them. I went to the B. E. S. T. thing sponsored by the business school. It was so much fun. We went to the lake. Hello, Jenny wrote me a note. My printer is off. I can't think of anything else to write about. I was valedictorian, I was nervous when I said my speech. YAY for 5. 0 GPA. For having such a high GPA, you would think that I wouldn't be so scatterbrained. I think it is just because it will take me a little while to get used to the whole college experience thing. I have to sign up to do that psychology experiment. I want to do the prescreening. Victoria says that it takes two hours. I want to get it over with and not procrastinate. I have that awful habit and am trying to get rid of it. I like this song, and that song, well, maybe not. I want to go so sleep. I went to sleep early last night 9:30. Oh, this is that singer Chad Kroger (I am such a bad speller). I liked Spiderman 2. I have always been a fan of stuff like that: Spiderman, Batman, Superman, etc. I like Smallville on the WB. It is a good show. What else. I can't think of anything else. Ok, I have about 3 and a half minutes left. What else should I do. I have chemistry in an hour but I should leave in 1/2 an hour because I want to get a good seat in class. I'm so blind, even with my contacts. I don't want to sit in the very front row because then I will strain my neck having to look straight up at the Professor. I have Professor Laude. He is very funny. I went to a discussion session at 11. Wait, it was at 10 and ended at 11AM. I think is was fairly productive. I'm a business major. Did I mention that. I'm also pre-med. I want to be an pediatric ophthalmologist. That is just a fancy term for a kid eye doctor. It will be able to be cool to say that though. My mom was a doctor. My dad has a PhD, so he is in a sense a doctor. He is asst. Dean of the Business School at UNT. I like this song. It is by Maroon 5. Nigel, my older brother, he is 23, I think, likes this song. He has this CD and will never let me borrow it. He called me last night and was  ",1
2266,"I am watching an episode of Mad TV and they were doing a parody on the whole parish priest / alterboy thing, singing Nelly's ""Hot in Herre"". The whole thing makes me sick when I think about it. My desktop died on me while I was up at UT and I am shopping for a new computer. The soonest I could get one would probably be Christmas, because of the long delay in shipping and the safety issues of shipping it to home and having no one there to sign for it and shipping it to the dorm where someone might take it and I would never see it. But it really sucks that my desktop would just crap out like it did. At least I still have my laptop, even thought it is a brick, weighing over 10 pounds, but I chose it and paid for it. All in all, life on the computer side just sucks. I wrote this during Labor Day long weekend, so I just sitting here at home in Houston until tomorrow when I go back to Austin for a long haul, as I call it where I don't go back home until another holiday/long weekend. But I don't mind, I really enjoy living in Austin, although the dorm I live in sucks due to construction noises. I have late classes on TTH and I don't get up until like 11, but I still am awakened by construction at 10 or so. Even though I didn't know my roommate until I move in with him, I do not regret going potluck. He is pretty cool, and he respects my wishes and I do the same for him. He has early classes on the same days that I do, so he doesn't bother me when he gets up in the morning, and I don't bother him when I wake up, because he has the same classes at the same times as I do. So that is cool. It's an oddity that I am writing this, for I do not really know how to write papers. So I decided to write this like I would for my blog on LiveJournal, like I am writing to my best friends. When I get back to Austin, I need to get my Calculus book and maybe find a movie that me and my friends can go to, just as kind of a day off thing to kill time before the daily grind starts again. Sadly II feel like this after only one and a half weeks of school at UT, into my freshman year. But the work is not the problem, the problem is the walking, but I will have to just get used to that aspect of UT. ",0
2405,"     I'm writing this assignment feeling kind of strange because I attempted it yesterdays on my st and my computer froze right when the timer said 19:59. very ironic. I feel very tired right now and really unmotivated. I have a lot to do and I don't feel like doing anything. I wish I could just go to sleep. I need a lot of attention from people these days and I'm just not getting it. matt took my car to san antonio to go to court and he apparently forgot to tell me about it. seems very convinient of him but whatever. he is acting weird, and different but he doesn't know or doesn't see what he's doing. it seems pointless for me to even get angry or bothered by it and I'm slowly beginning to not care. but that will be his loss because he will realize that he should be paying a little more attention to school, sleep, and me then to the things that he is focusing on. maybe I'm just overreacting though, because I seem to do that so well. I don't feel like being here, my head hurts, and I smell burnt popcorn in the hall way. I have a long day tomorrow and my last class is over at 5. I don't know what the day will have in store for me, hopefully I will be able to focus on my studies and not worry about all this other stuff that's bothering me. I need to realize that I can make myself happy and I don't need someone else to make me happy. I don't even know why I'm rambling on about this, its just always in my head I suppose. I hope I get a new car. my dad said I can maybe get something now from the money well get from the insurance. but who knows what kind of car he's going to get me. It will probably be something crappy like I have now. but I can't complain, something is definatly better than nothing, at least in this case. my economics book came in today. finally, becasue I was starting to stress that I was going to get too far behind. I really need to sit down with my books and my notes and try to really comprehend everything. even though I do try but I need more. I need to focus on doing that for all of my classes. but economics and chemistry are the main ones that I might have difficulty in. just because they are very mathy subjects. I might stay at the appartment tonight but I probably won't because I have such an early class tomorrow. well see what happens I suppose. I think matts court started already and he didn't even call me to let me know that he got to town safely. oh well, like I said I'm slowly starting not to care about all of these little things. that might be bad though because it might lead me to not care at all, about anything. it feels bad to feel like you're on the back burner, or that things have changed, though one person might like the change its not good unless both people involved agree with or like the change. I'm so tired right now I could easily go to bed and not wake up until tomorrow. but I can't do that because I have entirely too much work to do. tonight I want to get caught up with my psychology eradings, and I want to study my chemistry and continue to work on hw assignment number two. my roommate just went to heb to get nick a birthday cake. I hope all of that works out ok. if matts still not back ill probably stop by the study lounge to tell him happy birthday but I'm really not into all that socializing that everyone does. I'm usually either really wrapped up with my work or with matt. I don't know how good that is but it makes me happy and that is what counts to me. I just hope it counts to him. oh well. I met with my mentor group earlier. they're all really nice people and I hope I get to know them a lot better as the year progresses. its a pretty fun experience. this weekend should be fun. I'm going to meet up with my friend laura in san Marcos and go see some people that I haven't seen in a long time. I hope I can scrounge up something to wear, because I need to do laundry and I need to go shopping,  I have like no clothes anymore, I don't know what happened. my sister is complaining to me about me having her shirts so ill have to give her back her clothes if I see her this weekend. I hinestly don't feel like going home though. it gets too awkward for me. I don't know what but I don't really like it. I'd rather just stay here and study or like watch TV then go home and feel awkward with my family. I have so much to do and I'm starting to stess out and the semester has only begun. I can already see that college is going to be very hectic. I hope I can handle it alright. wow the time is up. ",0

Anyways,  right now I am kind of upset because my roomates are messy and keep on leaving the lights on when they are not occupying the room. I hope our electric bill isn't very high. Man, I have so much reading to do it is not even funny. I miss my boyfriend and family a lot and want to go home. Sometimes I wish I could just go to college at home. I can't go there cause I have a scholarship to attend this school. I have been very bored lately. Wow, I am so suprised that there wasn't a humungous waiting list to use these computers. I sure hope this computer isn't for a handicap person cause it is higher than all the others. Oh, well if a handicap person comes I'll just move. The guy across from me looks funny because he is looking at his computer with astonishment and his mouth is wide open. I'm trying to think of things to write but it is kind of boring in here so my thoughts are not flooding out like they usually do. I tried to do the pre-testing but it wouldn't let me in because it said other people were already using it. That sucks!!!!!  Man, after this I think I am going to move to another regular computer because I am starting to feel really guilty. There are a lot of empty computers right now. Cool there is a huge M hanging above my computer and my name starts with M. After this I will probably search the web for volunteer agencies that I can volunteer for for my social work class. I have about 8 more minutes to write. Man, something got on my beautiful, cute kitty folder and made some of the paint come off. I wonder what it was. These computers are cool because you can bring cd's and listen to them. Is that a girl or a boy?  First I thought it was a boy but he/she had a very colorful girlish looking purse. I think it is a boy. My hands are starting to kind of hurt from typing. I probably sound like a baby. Oh man, a guy just sat at the computer that I was planning to use next. I guess I'll just sit on the next role. 5 more minutes. I hope it is not dark when I go home cause I have to walk. I'm bored!!!!!!!I can't wait to go home and eat. What shall I eat???  I certainly don't feel like eating hamburger helper leftovers again. Maybe I'll order something from Plucker's or walk over there. 3 more minutes. They should have music in here. Nah, that's not a good idea cause not everybody likes the same kind of music or can concentrate with it on. I can. I think I've seen that guy before somewhere. Well, time is about up, finally :) ",0
2394," Wow this is actually a cool writing assignment. I would have never expected to be asked to sit here at my computer and just write what I am thinking for a 20 minute period. I have just gotten back from a meeting about the Texas Lonestars organization and LOVED it!  The only problem is that I am just a freshman still getting use to the whole college life and time management thing. I am kind of stressed out (but not nearly as bad as I know I can get sometimes) just because I am pre med and I know that I really need to concentrate on my grades and school work while also getting involved. Getting involved, however has never been a problem for me. I love to be involved in everything. Now that is a problem because if I spread myself too thin I am not going to be able to put forth my best in each venue. I know for sure that I want to do something involving dance because it has been such an intricate part of my life for so long and is truly one of my passions. I am going to try out for the Roustabouts and the Steel Dance Company. I am beginning to get nervous just because I haven't really gotten the chance to practice anywhere here since I've been away from home. I hope that I am able to keep my grades really good while also having fun and enjoying my college experience. I know that I am here to get an education, but it's obvious to everyone that college doesn't just teach you knowlege in your courses that are suppose to be preparation for your career, but it's also a learning experience for life lessons. I feel that just in the week and a half that I have been here I have already become more responsible and determined.      It has been kind of hard switching from not only my hometown to a new, huge city, but also from summer and relaxation and the feeling of ""yey school is over"" to ""wow, my life is just beginning, along with lots of studying that I don't really want to do. ""  My life has just been kind of awkward lately anyway. I know that things are suppose to change when you go off to college in so many ways especially through your habits and relationships and mine definitely has. The fact that my family has been going through changes of its own has made me feel somewhat distant and like I don't belong. Yet, the funny thing is that I don't really care or maybe it's that I don't know how to make the effort to fit in again. My first time to go home will be to a different home than the one that I've lived in for the past four years (even though I lived there when I was younger) and I feel like it will just be weird to see how my family's lives have just king of carried on without me. I won't really understand my mom's relationship with the guy she is dating or how my brother is experiencing or enjoying high school. My dad is perhaps the only one that I will probably still feel just about the same with because I am use to not seeing him all the time. My time is almost up and as of right now I am just really hoping that, even though I may not be showing my priority to God right now, he will really just step into my life and help me control it in the right direction.

149,"My love for computers and hate for computers is simultaneously growing as I sit here and write this assignment. I don't understand any software but everything for IBM, and the Macintosh is completely foreign to me. I must have already asked at least 30 questions regarding the system, but hey I am new to this whole Apple thing. Apple should just get rid of itself entirely and sell itself to Microsoft and the computer world will be a lot happier. Every time I type the word a lot, I am reminded of my English teacher in 10th grade, or maybe it was 9th who dispelled the myth that a lot was one word. I'll begin to type it as one, but then realize that I should have written it as two. I think it is really strange how some teachers you remember their words, but cannot remember their names or faces. I see a lot of people around campus just like that although I remember their faces and words, for the life of me I cannot remember their names, and I would fell absolutely terrified if they were to come up to me and use the overly cliched phrase, Azi, do you remember me?? More than likely I would not, or I would be to involved in my own thoughts to try to recall who the individual standing before me was. I do that a lot. People will have said that they may have called my name 3 or 4 times before I responded by just looking up. My thoughts consume me sometimes. I have a problem with daydreaming. I know that it is not necessarily a bad thing, but nonetheless it can get in the way of a lot of really important things. It is a good thing that in this particular assignment, daydreaming is the foundation for all my thoughts, and will assist me in coming up with ideas to write. I was talking about my thoughts, and how I daydream. Well, lately all I can think about is the perfect scenario for me to meet the man I am to marry. It seems foreign, and should probably not clutter the mind of a Freshmen in college, but it has been particularly bothered me. I have only really been involved in one serious relationship, if it can even be called that, and that in itself was a summer fling. I went to a summer church retreat, and I think this is where everything started to form, regarding marriage, because I met guys for the first time that I could honestly see myself marrying. This has never happened before, and as I glance around the campus, I just don't see them there, and it frustrates me knowing that they are somewhere else, and I am here longing for there company. It is not like I need there company, no yes it is that was a lie. I miss them a whole lot because I have never, ever been able to relate to a guy like the guys that I met at this church retreat in California. I think I forgot to mention that most of them are dispersed throughout Cali, and I have very little chances of seeing them ever again, unless I actively seek a job to where I can live, go to school, and everything in the wonderful Golden State of California. All of there pictures, guys and girls from the retreat are plastered on the wall above my desk, and I miss them terribly. I have to go back some day, I haven't enjoyed myself, and have been so completely relaxed as I had in California. I know it has nothing really to do with the beaches, although it plays a little  bit of why I would like to go there, and the earthquakes certainly are not the reason I would want to maintain a lifestyle there, it's the people of my religious community. it's a bond, a connection that going to a Baptist church, or a Jewish synagogue embodies. That spirit is completely alive in the people in my religion, just like any religion. It would be ideal if I could just go to school there, get a chance to meet a bunch of people. Get my education, get my education, get my education, finish my education, and I stress this because that is a big part of my life, but I am continually fascinated by marriage, commitment, meeting the man of my dreams, meeting the man of my dreams. It's nothing particularly fancy, or romantic, I am not asking for the Ken and Barbie playhouse world with the plastic pink convertible, I just want to get married, start a family, and live my life with all the values, challenges, and commitments it has to offer. I just don't think that I can have that right now, and that is why I spend so much of my time thinking about the endless possibilities of everything having to do with relationships and evaluating my life with and without everything, and just dreaming, night and day about how wonderful and how absolutely dreadful it would be to be married. The challenges are endless in the pursuit of life. And if I may I would like to end with a statement that Linda Ellerbee made after every news statement, perhaps my favorite statement ---and so it goes. ",0
2382,"stream of consciousness. Somewhat reminiscent of william faulkner's ""A Light in August""  we read that nnovel in my senior AP English class and although iit was a touch on the  boring side at the beginning, it proved to be quite an interesting story. Well I'm in my  dorm rightnow and there is this ceaseless squeaking noise coming from the refrigerator  that always is loudest at the most inconvenient times. I. E: when I'm trying to take a  nap. Our refrigerator is in the closet. It was in the middle of the room, but my roommate  moved it into the closet and put our television in the middle of the room instead. My  roommate's name is Ricky and he's been out of town this weekend as far as I can tell. He  kind of just didn't come home on friday night so my assumption is that he's visiting his  family. I think he's from Laredo, but I could be mistaken. Ricky is dating a girl named  Natalie and the most distinct thing about him is his cologne. Because it smells like crap!  Which sucks, because it's a really expensive Dolce and Gabbana or however you spell it. It  really is terrible because it's like the stink of the cologne is like a glue and has stuck to  everything in our room. Especially all my clothes, which has made me start to smell like  him. Oh I hate it. I always want to say something, but it would be weird saying to him that  his designer cologne smells like ass and that I could make the scent personally with some  onions and curry. God! I've been kind of looking around for a church these past couple of  weeks, but haven't exactly found one. Well I found one on guadalupe, but haven't looked at  what the times are for mass or whatever. My dad is really pushing me to start going to  church because in the last few years he's become somewhat of a Jesus freak. He's not bad,  but it just seems that his faith has made him so condemning of so many things. For  instance, I joined a fraternity and he wants nothing to do with it; refuses to help pay for it  simply because he doesn't like fraternities. But he doesn't exactly say why. And since he's  never been in one I don't see how he can make such a judgement. Oh well, my dad and I  went camping this weekend. We like rock climbing so we were planning on going to a  place called Reimer's Ranch. So we found a new camp site called Krause Springs and it  was really nice. So we camped there with a fire and the whole 9 yards or whatever. But  me and my dad shared a tent and iit was so hot in there and he snored so loud that I took  the plastic rain cover off the tent and went and laid near where the fire was on the  ground. It was pretty bad, but I made it through. Only got about 3 and a half hours of  sleep though. ughh. Oh well, when we all woke up we went and got breakfast and headed  to Reimer's and it was closed! so all that work for nothing. But we didn't give up hope and  went to this other place they call the greenbelt and got set up to climb there, but only got  to do one route because it started to rain. So after that our hopes were pretty much shot  so my dad just brought me back to my dorm this morning around noon and I took a nap  that I just woke up from about 20 minutes ago. So my weekend was pretty lackluster but  it'll be ok because I know next weekend will be fun enough to make up for this one. Oh  well. My mom just called me a second ago and I was like, ""can I call you right back? I'm  doing a project"" and she's so understanding and just said ""bye"" really quick so after I'm  done with this thingy I'll call her back. I've actually been keeping in touch with my mom  pretty well since I moved here which has been nicer than I imagined it would. I expected it  to be annoying talking to her too much but I was mistaken. I've also been talking to my  sister via email which has been fun. She's so funny and always has something to say, but  whenever I call home and she answers it's like we have nothing to say and I just ask for  mom. kind of funny, but it's cool. I know it's weird, but the thing I miss the most about  home is my dog. I have a full-blooded springer spaniel named Lola and she's such an  awesome dog. I miss her so much, but I'm hoping that if I live in a frat house next year I  can bring her along so we don't have to be apart anymore. Oh well, I guess we'll see ",0
618,"This is kind of difficult to do, because I am still in school mode, and it is hard to just right anything because I am trying to make it acceptable to a professor but I am doing my best to keep righting continuously for twenty minutes, I guess we supposed to just right what were thinking about right now, so I will tell you, I am kind of hungry and I wonder if the cafeteria is open downstairs because I am to cheap to go out and buy my own food, michael Jackson is kind of scary don't you think, the way his nose just kind of pokes out at you is really weird and sometimes I shudder when I see pictures of him, but I am working on getting over that right now and hopefully I will be able to watch the thriller video with out breaking down into a sobbing mess I wonder why my roommates keep the room so cold, it is like an icebox in here and my toes are always freezing, I have to go stand outside on my balcony to warm them up during the day, I wonder what I will do during the winter when I can't use the sun to warm my toes I guess I will just have to buy a footbath I am excited about the video music awards coming on tonight because they are always good for a few good laughs but I have to run now so I will see you kids later ",0
787,"As I start this essay I am feeling a little wary because I am doing it a little late. I am starting to think about what to write. I think that if I don't write something intellingent I will come off as dumb or ignorant as to what I am feeling. I am also thinking erotic thoughts. I am also feeling embarassed for writing that down. I am scared that after reading this you will think that I am a pervert (which I am not). I am once again thinking about what to write; once again thinking that if I don't write something smart I will come off as dumb. I am beginning to think of friends from back home. People I left behind, family, friends, teachers with whom I had pretty good relationships. I am now thinking of a conversation I had with two other friends on a very private issue. My father comes into my head also, times I have spent with him after he and my mother seperated. Then I think of times with my stepmother and how my mother would dislike it if she knew that I acknowledge her as someone related to me. I am now feeling a little anxious because I do not want my sister to come home right now and see that I wrote something about having erotic thoughts. I now am thinking of a girl in one of my classes. It isn't erotic, I am just thinking of what she looks like in the class and how I would like to talk to her sometime. Then I start to feel a little down because I haven't made any really close friends in college yet, just aquaintences. Again I am thinking about what to write. I just got an image of the capitol as it looks from the tower and I just thought about the tower. I think about going to Mezes hall to sign up for an experiment. I am now worrying again because I haven't signed up for one. ",0
965,"well I just got back from my home town in huntsville today. I went down there for my granny and paw paws fiftieth wedding anniversary. I think today was the hardest move I ever made. it as my first trip home since I moved  down here. the first time wasnt as hard as today was. I guess I realized that I don't live there anymore. when I was leaving I thought to myself I have to go home. but this doesn't feel like home to me, huntsville does. I had a blast while I was there. I got to see most of my friends including my girlfriend which I was basically forced to break up with because of my move cause everyone knows that long distance relationships don't work. but it was like nothing had even changed. I had so much fun with her and with my old friends. I honestly didnt want to come back today. I cried the most I've ever cried in my life today. the hardeset thing for me was to see my mom cry. I think she realized that I was actually gone as well. I could also tell my dad was fighting back the tears. the only other time I have ever seen my dad almost close to crying was when his grandmaw died. me and him are best friends. he told me he loved me today which I havent heard out of his mouth in a while because you know,  were ""men"". as I pulled out of my driveway, my mom and dad were hugging each other,  they have never done anything but scream and yell at each other since my 18 years of living there. I burst into tears at the sight and drove off with that pain in youre neck you get when you try to fight back tears. this still wasnt as bad as when I had to tell my exgirlfriend bye again. she was the last person I saw before I left and I spent about an hour over there. we talked about how much fun we used to have. I wish I could see her more often. she gave me my birthday present today because I wont be home for it. she wrote me the sweetest card  and I started to cry again. then I opened the present and it was a fairly expensive watch and I burst into tears again. I realize how much she really is in love with me and I wish I was there to share that with her. its going to be even harder to get usec to living down here now. to end with a good note every one I visited sent me lots of food back. thanks for listening, I feel a lot better now.

1286,"As I begin this assignment, I'm not sure what to say. I really never write my thoughts down. Maybe I should. I want to play halflife, but I can't. It seems I don't have enough hours in the day to do everything I want to. Maybe I should be better in my time management. But I think I'm pretty good as it is. I always try to plan out my day, making sure I have enough time for everything. Shoot, I can't believe I misplaced my bracelet, Laine gave it to me. She's so sweet. There's a speck of dust on my calendar. I better pick it up and throw it away. I've made a pact with myself to learn how to type correctly on a keyboard. No cheating whatsoever. It is really weird. But I think I'll grasp it eventually. I was just thinking about my trumpet. I', not in any band here, but I still like playing my horn. I just wish I had the time for it. That really pisses me off. Hopefully, after I firmly get adjusted, I can figure something out. I was just thinking about Saurin, when I went to his place a couple of nights ago. He's such a funny son of a bitch. I had a good time. I wish his place had better lighting, though. its too dark. But I like the living room action. This dorm is very restrictive; I can't wait until I get an apartment. I'm sick of walking to a dining hall for food. And I really want to eat meals with meat in them. I got to finish my math work. Maybe I'll invite Matt over again, Darren's coming over after 6:30. I just have a couple of problems to work out, but then there is the new section. I probably should do most of that tonight so I can ask the TA some questions. That one guy got number 30. But he'll be there tomorrow, so that's cool. Man what's that other guy's name  yellow hat boy  Starts with a G, Garge or something. I checked my answers with him this morning. Most of them were right, thank God. I just hope I can pull something good in this class. I'm determined to work hard. God willing, I won't end up like some of my friends. Man I'm tired. I always seem tired. I don't know why. Four more minutes. this backspace key next to the spacebar is so convenient. I don't have to pick my hand up whenever I make a mistake. That just goes to show how lazy I am. Mofo action lazy. I got a reply from Russell today, I was so glad, I miss him, I miss a lot of people. I guess it's going to take me a while to find people like those I left behind in high school. They were so good in so many ways. There's music playing. oh well, time's up. ",1
1710,"Well, let's see, what am I thinking and feeling?  My thoughts are actually really scattered right now, but this is due tomorrow, so, here it goes. I guess what's really on my mind is this day and this week. It's been really, really stressful. The only thing more stressful than having a lot of stress in you life is the people you love having a lot of stress in their lives too. The week did not start off well, as I lost a really cushy job, and it was just because I procrastanated and that made if even worse. Then, I got an interview, off campus 15 min of course, that was probably going to suck anyway, and I had all kinds of problems trying to print out resumes and work study verification forms because one computer had a printer and one had the internet and of course neither one would work with both, so I was frantically trying to get them to work and had no time for rest or lunch, didn't know where I was supposed to go and was freaking out. I could have cried. Right before I was about to walk out for my interview though, on chance I called back a lady that I had left a message for about a really cool job having to do with my major at an art museum on campus. It  was my dream job but I was sure it would already be gone. Just my luck though, I impressed the woman enough she hired me on the spot and I got the job!  It was really cool, but the stress leading up to it sucked. So things got better after that but today things were just shit. One of my friends is having all kinds of family problems because her father was being a selfish jerk. My other best friend's grandmother died and needless to say he was very upset. I cooked dinner for them though, but there is still so much drama around me and I hate drama. I guess I can't complain though, my job is great. I love working with art. The lady I'm working with takes time to tell me about everything. There were just a lot of jobs cut though and I feel really bad for her because I know she has a lot of stress because a lot of her help just got fired. But my other co-worker is really funny and I like her a lot but I'm really sad that she might be going away soon to Washingtone, D. C. Everyone  else seems really awesome though and it's really laid back and flexible. Let's see what else. Oh yeah, of course boy troubles. Boys suck, that's all there is to it. Sometimes, I wish they would all just die. Or at least those that suck. Not my friend da Byron though. I love him. He e-mailed me another of his famous funny e-mails and it always makes me feel better. :)  Also people who criticize you for stuff that's none of their business. Know what I really need?  A break from all people. I just want to be alone. I want to jump on a plane and go some place thousands of miles away with a different culture and everything. I want to go to a dig in Greece and get away from everything. I hate feeling I owe something to other's feelings. I guess I'm just tired. The minute you get caught up in others lives you invite so much drama and pain into your life. I guess I'm just tired of that. It would just be great to start all over again, but I know that I can't regret the past and that I learn from everything I do. I have to keep reminding myself that my life is really not that bad after all, I mean I have awesome classes, great oppurtunities, a man that really does love me, and friends who really do mean the best even if I do want to choke them or run away from them sometime. In the end, I guess it's worth it because I know how lonely and boring life would be with out all of them there. It's just what you have to put up with. I only wish judgement from those you love was not so harsh or deep reaching. Well, I'm about out of time (thankfully my shoulder is hurting) so this is my great rant, but I'm done now and writing all out really does make you feel better. :) ",0
522,"I wonder if you are out there watching over me as I stumble through this maze called life. where on this heavenly universe do you have the  time to make sure I don't get run over by the UT buses or nearly crash as I recklessly drive home from alli's house? you must be there because you are witness to my every sin and good deed. did you send a special angel to watch my every step and blunderous move?  that's how I feel sometimes is that everything I do is wrong or misguided and I'm always worrying about whether or not I did the right thing. but I'm so glad I have Alison and Melissa  to help get through this social forum called college. if I could go shopping right now I'd buy every single maryjane shoe in sight. oh to have money! but I feel so guilty to have these materialistic desires that Christ  does not approve of. he tells us to let go of these worldly possessions if we truly want to be a follower in his footsteps. I'm 18 for peaches sake and want stuff!!! As the father said at church during the Homily, ""it's very hard to be a Christian"" am I one? I was baptized and received communion but did not go on to be confirmed into the catholic church or heck even  do my first confession! that is way to weird for me. and what about finding the right man to fall in love with? what if he is so wonderful in every  way but is skeptical in Christian faith. like the guy in one of my classes I've never spoken to him but he seems sensitive and so good looking yet doesn't come across and ""Christian"" but appearances are always deceiving so I will hope for the best. oh my! I feel so guilty over something so  insignificant but it bothers me. I did not say good bye to josh, only  the sweetest boy in the world. he would have said bye. he even said  hello to me and remembered my name. now I know why alli is having such a hard time getting over him and that he is perfect and has a girlfriend he really loves. that's so understandable. I wonder what it would be  like to read all these confessions of the soul by psy 301 students. some people's brains I would be very scared of. I wonder what psychology boy  wrote. quiet soul. like me. I like that. I wonder if my mom is  doing good. I hope that I get to grow spiritually when I go t o church camp. yay! meet more people and make new friends. I find that hard to do I am always going out with Allison. it's like she's  the only person I hang out with. but we cling to familiarity and that's okay. I met Erica today and talked, well, she talked. like her. good person. geo is nice boy I wonder if he still loves Krista. I wish I had somebody's heart  like that. god, when will I find him? I guess I m going to have to crawl out my shell if I want to meet the boy and leave earlier for class and sit  right next to him. I'm really tired and I think twenty minutes have passed. alright, girlie. you are going to go to sleep and dream of sweet things and cute boys who open  the door for you. thank you lord for allowing me  to get these words out of my head into the cyber-psychology  world.

2118,this is one of the most interesting assignments I've had. Frisbee tomorrow I'll be late. I'm homesick and a bad typer is that the right word oh well All my friends and family enjoying themselves without me (sigh) this getting used to college is a little more difficult than I imagined but I guess that I always have trouble starting something new my legs are tired I ran 4 miles and played Frisbee When I started elementary school I cried and clung to my dad's leg Ican't remember middle school Funny how I can remember something farther away than something more recent maybe elementary was more traumatic. Then high school I got really tiny because I think I had a nervous stomach I can hear the girl next to me' s headphones It must be a foreign language We have to do that in French I'm finally getting hungry I thought I never would I need to work out more It is kind of depressing to have once worked out on a team five days a week twice a day with a whole bunch of people now I have to make myself do stuff that is not as fun I go by myself to the gym and to swim at least I found frisbee except they're a little more advanced than me but the practices aren't a s strenuous and as frequent as my old swim practices My room mates sick puking all night I keep washing my hands and the door knob every thing she touches It makes me nervous when people are sick I don't want to catch it and get my life off schedule I mean heck it just got into some kind of routine then I'd go and get sick miss class miss practice and have to get the notes from someone and not fall to far behind that makes me nervous  I used to get sick all the time when I swam every winter I would get some kind of 5- 7 day flu and it would usually mess everything up My training for the meets especially I was so frustrated sometime s I would try and convince myself I wasn't sick and I would just keep going as if nothing was wrong and then bam I couldn't do it any longer I would be so weak and tired I had just made it worse Nothing like making a problem even worse Only three minutes to go and I'm hungry I think I will have an apple they taste mmmm I like to eat fruit I had a boyfriend that pretty much didn't eat fruit or vegetable he liked mashed potatoes and gravy chicken fried steak and all that stuff is fine but you have to balance or your going to die to soon probably unless you have good genes people should take care of themselves         ,1
1544,"     whats up im tearing awwaaayyy  my name is Hope i like fish, and stuff like that, sarah's music is loud so it is hard to write i think. . my room has lilo and stitch in it a lot, my doll is funny from that movie it is green, it's name is Rogelia i'm not really sure how to spell it. the suite mates across from us are very loud, they like to laugh a lot- it's not really laughing it's more like cackling and shouting at the same time. . This drowning pool song is a good song but the lead singer died the other day. I wish my hair didn't take so long to dry and straighten and everything it gets annoying and makes me mad sometimes  the phone is ringing in the room across the bathroom they're so loud    I like goldfish i'm glad i got them from the campus store. .

163,"Today my aunt Caroline came up to visit me. she was on a trip out here for business meetings. She told me a bunch of stories about her life at UT when she went here 25 years ago. she told that she was almost raped by a serial rapist the police had been trying to catch for two years. He had been stalking her for weeks, and she never even knew. the only other person I knew who this had happened to is a friend of mine who had an abusive boyfriend who would rape her on a daily basis. she's finally doing a lot better, but still has kind of a loser boyfriend. guys are just weird that way. I've been going out with the same guy for close to two and a half years now, and it looks like we might get married!  I'm really excited about that, we've had lots of plans about various things, but I don't know. we want a house and kids and that whole thing. today in art class, one lady had a quilt as her piece to express an emotion and it really brought me that sense of home. It was so pretty, it had a floral design, but also had these powder green and white solid pieces. It really made me feel at home and almost at my grandma's house. she's got a quilt her mother made, and it is about seventy years old. It was made from material of old clothes that no one fit into anymore. Their family was so incredibly poor that they lived out in the countryside, and worked in the fields. my grandmother has told stories of her life, some gruesome and some amazing. she used to be the one to cut off the heads of the chickens they ate, and it was nothing to her just normal. other times she can remember riding through the country side on her horse where there are now huge freeways and shopping centers. I often wonder what it would be like living back then. she gave me a magazine clipping of how life was like as a teacher back then (she was a teacher, and I am going to be a teacher) and IÃ¯Â¿Â½m am really glad that we are well on our way into the twenty first century!  they used to not be able to be married, have children, they had to go to church every Sunday, clean the classroom at least once a week on their hands and knees with a hand brush, and all these other gruesome things. the only thing I have to worry about are the guns and cuts that go on in the schools (maybe it would be better to go back to the old days, huh?)  I want to be an art teacher, but IÃ¯Â¿Â½m not sure how that will all work out. my major will allow me to be an artist but with an all-level teaching certificate on the side. so. I can either be a starving artist or a starving teacher!  (both kind of sad)  however, I don't really want to have to be out there working, IÃ¯Â¿Â½m more of a homebody, and want to be the typical housewife. everyone I know thinks IÃ¯Â¿Â½m crazy, but that has been my goal (perhaps ""dream"" is too strong a word) ever since I can remember. I have also wanted five children since the time I was about eight years old. I actually come from a family of four children, so maybe the fifth I want is an unconscious way of somehow ""outdoing"" my parents. that has often worried me because it's kind of what it sounds like, but I really don't feel that way. my parents were actually the ones who first brought it up, so I don't know.

1798,"Well, it's been a long day. I'm really tired but I am not very excited about going to my last class, just because right after I get out I have to rush home, change clothes, and go to work. I can think of a million other things I would much rather be doing, ya know?   But, hey, that's just life, right?  It actually feels good to be working again. I always seem to get more accomplished in school, when I have a set routine. Last year, I was just a huge mess. All I did was party, never go to class, wake up and feel like crap all day. I'm only 20, but I feel like I'm already finished with my days where I don't remember anything or have a clue as to what's going on. It makes me laugh. Anyway, so it really annoys me in the library when people have their stupid cell phones on and they start ringing and then they answer it and just start chatting in a regular tone. Or on the bus!  I don't care to hear everyone's conversations they have, but they talk like they want everyone to know what they're doing. I just thought about that because it just happened a few times in a row. But I'm not really anal about anything. I'm already thinking about what I want to do when I get off work tonight. It's the weekend, yea!!  I hope Nick comes into town. I haven't talked to him in like almost 2 weeks. It's really weird. I can't even understand it myself. I'm crazy about this guy and I have been for about 6 months. He says that he thinks about me all the time too. It's just like some sort of connection I felt with him from the first time I sat down and talked to him. It's weird because we just hang out and are just like the same person. He's so funny too. But we never talk or tell each other how we feel unless we're just trashed and then we vaguely remember what we said. I'm usually not like that with guys as far as not being straight up, but right now I think it's just maybe not worth it to try to get involved because he lives in houston and I am obviously here. It's like, I know it's a mutual feeling, but I wouldn't want anything to ever mess up between us, I'd rather just wait until I know the time is right and then we can be together. Anyway enough about all that. I want to go home and hang out with my family. I love them so much. They're all just so cool. I would rather be with them than any of my friends I grew up with back home. My shoulders are so tight. It's from lugging around this heavy backpack all day. The first couple of weeks of school, I didn't even have a backpack so I hauled around this little pink Clinique plastic kind of hand bag with all my books. That was funny. I always had to laugh at myself, I'm laughing right now. I can just picture myself walking around campus. This cute guy just walked by. Well, I really just liked his hair. I love kind of long, messy hair with curls coming out of hats. They're so sexy. and dark eyes. I love dark eyes. They just seem to be so seductive. I have no problem whatsoever staring at anybody directly in the eyes. Sometimes I think I might even scare people. I feel like I can just see right through people. It's not because I think they're necessarily cute, or even that I want to talk to them.       ",0
1475,"Today I woke up really late and I had to run to class which made me tired. My math class is so easy I don't even know why I'm in it. Well actually I do it's because I'm in this FIG and that is pretty cool. It helps a lot. I don't know what exactly I'm supposed to write but I'm trying to just keep going. I know that I am happy today because my girl friend Ginger is coming to town and I haven't seen her in a week. That also includes my mother. I really miss her and I know that she is lonely. I also miss my brother and sister and even my dad. I wish I could play video games and party with my brother like we used to before I left. Speaking of partying I haven't done any of that since I came to Austin which is supposedly this huge party city. I think the reason that I haven't partied is because I have not been able to meet many guys here yet and that is usually who I go party with. I also miss my party pals from Arlington they weren't my best friends but they were a blast to go party with. I wonder how they are doing right now. I think they are probably skipping class for no reason, again. I don't know why you would skip class in high school it just gets you into too much trouble. I never got in trouble in high school until the last day when me and a lot of senior guys rode our bikes up to school and then through the school. That got us Dhall, but it was worth it because the bike thing was really fun. In fact all of high school was really fun except  no all of it was fun. It was easy there was always a party and I had a group of good friends to hang out with which made it even better. Those kids who are still there do not know how lucky they are to still be there. I mean I love college and everything but it is just way different. And living by yourself isn't all its cracked up to be. I mean I have to clean my room, do my own laundry, and stuff like that. I also think that I had good morals installed in me because I feel really bad when I party in my room, which I thought I would do all of the time. But I guess that also has to do with my roommate. He is just fresh in from India and is not that accustomed to living in America yet. But he is a lot cooler than I thought he was once I sat down and talked to him. I guess if you give people a chance most of them come through, except for the real jerks. I am listening to Prodigy right now and it is really fun to listen to I fell like writing down what it sounds like but since it is techno it would broadly be difficult for me to accomplish that. I wish that I had the musical talent and equipment to do something like that, but I have neither the time or musical capacity to really do that. ",0
1918,"I find it hard to write what I am thinking probably because I am always thinking of several things and it is hard to focus on one. But this weekend's events seem to come to mind. I had a really fun weekend. It is not just that I hate school and I needed a break, I honestly don't feel like I am really in college. I just feel like I am going through the motions. It hasn't really set in yet. But right not I am at a friends apartment where a couple of my friends and I have stayed these past couple of nights. A friend is watching Office Space in the background and I love that movie. It is a great movie and I find it amazing how you can relate much of your life to that movie. I just realized how dramatic I find my life. I make a big deal out of little things. I guess it is my way of dealing with the stress in my life. I make things into a huge deal so it seems too ridiculous to be upset about something that it doesn't bother me anymore. Especially when it comes to boys. I find them to be a huge headache. When a relationship doesn't work out I find it easier to be upset and hurt about it and make it not a big deal because once I am finished ranting and raving, it seems kind of silly. Besides it is easier to be upset at someone than it is to try and get over those feelings you had for them. But the thing about that is you can't hate them. Because in order to hate someone you have to have significantly cared for them at one time or another. The people that hurt you the most are the people that are the closest to you. And I don't want to the people I am mad to know that they have impacted my life to the extent where I am capable of hating them for hurting me. I don't know, it may sound complicated, but it works for me. Some people think I am a very complicated person, but I don't think I am. I consider myself to be an honest person and in return I expect your honesty in return. Don't bother lying to me. Don't waste my time. Time is always something that I lack. There aren't enough hours in the day. Ever since college I find myself sleeping at doing homework and hanging out at odd hours of the day. Just yesterday my friends and I went to 6th Street, went to eat and then came back to our friends apartment to swim at 6:00 in the morning. But I guess that is college. I am really looking forward to what the year holds for me. People here in Austin are really nice. There are some weirdoes, but overall I like it here. I think I made the right decision about college. Life is great. It really is. ",1
1848,"    This assignment is cool. It requires no outside tinking. I can just think about what I want to think about. Man I've got a three hour drive ahead of me today and i made the same drive yesterday. It was soooo boring. I wish i could just warp back to Austin or something like that. But i like being back in Pearland. It's great to see my family and friends again. I miss them sometimes and the once or twice a month i get to see them are well worth it. But when my trip is over, I'm always eager to see my peeps in Austin again and just to get back to normal life. I've got a lot of reading to do this weekend and i don't want to do it. It's alll textbook reading and i would much rather be reading Dean Koontz or just not be reading at all. I wish i could type faster and that way i could type a lot. I've got to type as much as possible. Otherwise i won't be satisfied with my experiment. blankness. . i want some new CD's to listen to on the way back to Austin. that way i wouldn't get a sbored as i was yesterday. and then the ride would weem much shorter. wow i still got thirteen minutes left. i wish i could slept in longer today but i had to wake up to make sure that i would finish this in time. i don't mind doing it but i'm jsut so dang lazy that this is even annnoying to me. I'm just not good at doing things that i don't want to do. oh well. i talked to Nick last night and we talked about how things are diff. now because i moved to Austin. all he does now is go out with girls since andy is going to San Antonio and i'm already in Austin. things have changed since i moved. i can't just go over to his house anytime i'm bored anymore  it's a three hour drive if i do. i miss those guys and my family more than i thought i would  it's weird being back at home. the place seems different. my room seems foreign to me because my parents cleaned it up and moved things around the week after i left for austin. i hope i'm not getting carpal tunnel syndrome, my wrists are getting kind of sore and my arms are already sore from playing racuetball the other day. it was fun thought and i'm probly going to play again today or tomorrow. i'm looking forward to it. ahhh no more wrist pain. i hope my brother won't get mad at me for stealing his computer chair but it makes my wrists feel so much better. WOW my phones loud it just scared the crap out of me when it rang see there it is!  typing is sooo much easier whne your in a  computer chair and not a dining room chair. i wonder what you'll think when your reading this or if anyone's even going to read it. hmmmmmmm.  i need to leave pretty soon so i don't hit Houston's rush hour but there is so much stuff i need to get done with here. wow the opportunity cost sucks. three more minutes. i only got a few more minutes and then no more of this mind to page thing. after that i can just think and not have to type it up or anything ike that. i hope Pearland wins tonight and moves up in Houston's rankings and AP state rankings. they are relaly good and deserve to be high up in all rankings. likewise i hope UT kicks NC's butt tomorrow because UT IS all that and a huge bag of potato chips. then maybe they could move ahead of OU in the AP rankings because everyone knows we're better than those north of the red river weirdos  who cares about the sooners anyway. Hybl sucks and their second and third strigers are both freshmen and that's really going to hurt em bad. oh well we'll see on October 12th. GO HORNS!!! ",0
617,"Two people, both human in their thoughts--both flattering and otherwise--probably can tell what the other might be thinking yet they refuse oh, fuck it, this is a boring fucking topic, let's move on. She flew in front of the rushing, in front of the huge tidal wave that sucked up the ocean and spat it out like a great hydrant unleashed. Everywhere were sparks of water drops, falling all around as if the sky had let some of its most prized stars fall to the earth for a short while. Pumping harder and faster in and out of the water like the wheels of a railroad made of air and invisible fire that could burn. So quickly was the pumping that the body never knew exactly when it was in water or air but letting the mind rest so that it didn't have to think about the possibility of its limbo state. Higher, faster, higher, faster, stretch, stretch, stretching for something with the next heave. Perhaps beyond this star-surrounded existence there was something more, something past the huge roaring of a thousand waves chasing. If the body could just stretch a little more, jump higher, breath with the vigor that said ""what's next?"". something might answer back. The sun would set itself on the sheet of a mirror made of those drops of stars and welcome the body and the attached mind into the core of-- of what?  Faster still, plunge, plunge, plunge to the rhythm of the thousand and one gadgets held somewhere between the awkward wave machine and the diving body. Maybe the answer was somewhere behind the body, maybe if it would just stop long enough the gadgets would swallow it up, the flat cold would open its innards and let the body know that all the time what it was leading was the salvation, the euphoric ""YES!"" it was looking for. But too much of a chance, the gadgets were probably chasing after the sun just like the body was. If not then why was it always following the dolphin forward. The dolphin continued its unceasing breath. Felt the crash, the massage, the spank, the kiss of the sea as it plunged under once again. Where was the sun?  Why didn't it show itself?  Faster, faster, enjoying to the fullest the sound of a thousand gidgets singing in a rhapsody of mixed chorus like the sound of the wind against the leaves and sand of those strange dry places where creatures coo and lie in the sun. Chasing the sun; if only the dolphin could call it. The dolphin was sure it didn't see it now. A few bleating cries, mixed with loneliness and bittersweet joy, the loneliness from being just behind the gears that all shared in their lives together and worked as if one, the joy of those drops, those thousand, star-filled drops that seemed too beautiful and quick to stay on the mirror waves long. The joy too, of feeling the waves rush up and pull and then give and pull and give all the while trying to stay just above, just beyond, further and further away if only to KNOW. For if life chasing the sun proved this-- this-- MUCH; this fullness that almost filled the body and the attached mind until it could almost hold no more except for that damn persistent hole that often slid part of the fullness down, then can one imagine what life in the sun might prove to be?  Bathed in the stars that only manage to peek out every once in a while in the disguise of sea foam?  Full of that diving feeling without having to take rushed breath?  Part of those lucky gadgets that can never envision loneliness because they are constantly surrounded by the humming that they make together in chorus?  The sun is slipping now, disappearing too quickly, lungs almost tear in the attempt to keep up, tail flipping sporadically, waves going by so fast they feel like hot coals searing the flesh. No, no, no, NO!  Gone now, a last sliver to leave in the mind of the dolphin to remind the body tomorrow, if the sun comes down to gather up its star-drops, of how close it came and how one day it would find a shortcut, a way to escape the in between limbo that held just enough splendor to incite the imagination. Deeper now and beside the humming gadgets who now are singing a softer chorus, like the cluck-cluck of a mother to child to soothe it to bed. This was the best part of the day, the calmness afterward, the coolness, the memories and the dreams. ""Hey dad?"" ""Yeah?"" ""Why do dolphins swim in front of ships?"" ""Hmm, I dunno'"" ""They're beautiful, huh?"" ""Yeah, they sure are. "" ""I love the way the sun reflects off their skin. "" ""Yep. ""     ",0
1304,well. how do I start? I suppose I'll just start by saying that I am very tired of school I don't even know why so soon I mean my classes aren't all that bad yet but I'm tired of waking up so early to catch the crowded bus and always having to walk everywhere in the heat one thing I am excited about is my boyfriend coming down in less than 9 days to visit me. he's from texas tech and I miss him so much the only bad thing is that I think that I'm hiding myself from the world because I feel safe enough with him that I block out the rest of the world and therefore I am not quite as social as I should be. but I'm really worried that I'm going to lose him and then where will I be? who will I have? oh well can't think of that right now. I'll enjoy my life with him for now long distance relationships are very hard. I don't quite know what will happen but I do know that he is very special to me and every guy I go out with in the future will be compared to him enough about the mushy stuff I'm living with my sister up here its really convenient she takes care of me and we don't really fight a lot she's sick right now I don't know what to do except for buy her medicine I'm a bad nurse oh wells I can't believe we have been in school for bout 2 weeks now. it feels like 2 months everything is moving by so slow I miss Dallas I can't wait to go back and visit my family and friends ill be going back in bout 2 weeks or so I hate it that I'm easily distracted when I start on my homework the tv usually gets to me because we have cable and so some really good movie will be on and ill sit there and watch it instead of working on my homework. that's really starting to become a habit and the thing is when the show is finally over and I start on my homework its already 12 and I'm pooped I need better study habits I'm currently a biology major. I don't even think that's what I'm going to follow through here I don't go out partying like most college students I think I should take advantage of my college years here but I really don't like the whole clubbing experience I'm full and I feel like vomiting. I think I ate too many chicken wings. oh wells I hate the computer I'm on the internet connection is really slow and I hate tying on a laptop computer. I'm use to the normal ones I still have a lot of reading to do I have to finish reading in this class and in biology. I hope I don't bomb any of my classes my parents expect me not to since my sister is here and will show me the ropes. do you know how much pressure that is? I feel as if I never seem to make my parents proud enough it comes with the territory. being the middle child is really hard anyways. I miss chili our chinchilla ill get to keep him for about 3 weeks so I'm really excited our apartment is so messy we live like boys I'm getting really tired already. I think ill be up late yet again tonight ill shower tomorrow morning I've dyed my hair 5 times and yet it wont give me the color I want I'm so frustrated I'm frustrated with life with school with love everything when I took the pretesting thing I felt so depressed. everything I was answering about myself was so negative. in some way and so I felt really bad once I was done. that reminds me I have to go check out that bulletin board to check out some experiments I could to do obtain my 5 hours actually now 3 1/2 which is great. I hope they don't make me do anything really weird I'm kind of hesitant to do that stuff oh wells I haven't been out a lot since I've been here in Austin I'm kind of homesick. I miss the simple life I lead when I was in Dallas everything has changed things are not so simple anymore I fell as though I'm not as happy here I don't know why though. don't worry. I'm not suicidal or anything I just wish I knew what was bugging me I think. actually I hope things will be fine soon this year is moving by so slow. and its so hard making friends I have at least one friend in each class except for chemistry that really bad because you should really have a study partner in that class I think ill have to make friends in there soon I feel stress stress from the world everything I hate it I get stressed easily sleep is overcoming me. I have to stay awake. I'm already behind in my readings can't get even more behind. I need a major massage my shoulders are so tense. my whole body is tense I like these kinds of writing assignments because it helps release some of my emotions hidden inside some stress has lifted but there's still a lot there well. my time has ended. its been 20 minutes 20 minutes that have flown by ill end it on this note. I need some sleep. I'm going to sleep goodbye. ,0
1027,"How strange is it to be sitting in a room, a strange room, in the dark without lights and two sleeping zombies around you. The only sounds I hear are the clicking noises coming from the keyboard, the humming sound of the computer, the air conditioning that sounds like running water from a nearby restroom and an occasional door slam now and then. I hope I am not making too much noise. I don't want to disturb the steady sleepers around me as they let me use their computer. I can't wait till my roomate's computer gets fixed or until my brother finally puts mine together. I wonder if my friend has arrived at Dobie and is coming up to find me in this room at this very minute. HOw much time has passed. Oh I still have four more minutes. I wonder what my boyfriend is doing this very minute? I think he is working. Should I go out with my friends tonight? No I'm going to stay home and read tonight. I miss my parents, the homecooked meals, and my boyfriend. I wonder if my friends miss me as much as I miss them? Life in Austin is pretty great, yet something seems to be missing in my life here. I think I'm still getting adjusted with this new style of life---no sleep, total independence, and the new surroundings and friendships, which are not the norms that I have been accustomed to all my years living in Houston. I had a routine in Houston, which can not exist here. ",1
49,"You know, when typing on a computer, twenty minutes is a long time. Figuring a person types 60 to 80 words per minutes, they will be typing between 1200 words and 1600 words per minute. I wonder if this assignment would be more effective if the students had to write it in pen, so that you could also see how they changed their mind. I know that I have already erased and retyped. I don't mean that I have taken the stream of consciousness out of it, just that I will change my mind on how I want to phrase things. I want this to make sense to any poor, unfortunate person who has to read this thing, and sometimes I takes me a while figure out a way to phrase thing that will accurately get the message of what I am trying to express across. Okay, I have managed to confuse myself with this stuff that I am saying. Somehow I don't consider it to be a good sign when I can confuse myself with something that I am thinking. It's too bad that I type faster than I think b/c right now I can even get all of my thoughts down. Wow, it finally put me on another line!  I don't have any idea what time I actually started typing. I remember looking at the clock at 5:13, but I was already typing then. I guess that I will just count that as my starting time, I am guessing that it really doesn't matter how long I write. Back to the confusing myself thing. you know, I have a habit of confusing myself. I will ask myself questions or think about ideas which really are lacking in logic, or else they have a strange logic. For example, at my high school, I am famous for my opinions about being normal. I once told my friend that I was the only normal person, and that the rest of them were all abnormal. Having said this, I realize that if I am the only normal person, that would make it abnormal to be normal, and normal to be abnormal. This would mean that although I was the only normal person in the group, I was really abnormal b/c it is normal to be abnormal and abnormal to be normal. At first this appears to make no sense, but once you think about it for a while, it starts to make perfect sense, at least to me anyway. And those people who have been blessed enough to hear this theory get it eventually. I have no idea if I am supposed to be writing this thing as if I was talking to someone, but that is really the only way that I can write it. I am used to writing emails a lot like this, and I have a tendency to talk like this too. I will say, or write whatever is on my mind. This  results in a lack of sentences in my emails. I separate the thoughts with little dots. everything is in sentence fragments. I just write what I am thinking at the time. That is why I was so happy about this assignment, imagine, I am getting a grade for doing something that I do all the time!  But then again, it's not like the people I write to hate my emails. In fact, most of them love my emails. My boyfriend, Justin, always tells me how much he loves my emails. And lately, I have noticed that I have been influencing people with the way I write. More and more of my friends have started writing very stream of consciousness emails to me. I like them though, b/c I think that they give a greater insight into how a person if feeling and what they are thinking. I am a terrible speller, and a bad typer too. I can type really fast, but I am not high on the accuracy. Sometimes I do really great, but other times, well. it's embarrassing. I think that in college I am gonna major in typos and creative spelling!  I haven't eaten anything today. It is 5:26 now. I guess after I finish this I will go back to the dorm room and then I will go eat dinner. Or maybe I won't. I am not really that hungry but I feel bad about wasting meal tickets. Last week I didn't eat anywhere near the two meals a day that we bought. I might just go and eat some yogurt that I have in the fridge. The advantage to not eating, and then getting all this extra exercise walking around this school, is that it will help me get in shape. This is ridiculous, it has been 15 minutes and I am only on the [now] fifth line!  You know, I don't like typing. I think that I am a candidate for carpal tunnel. I am exaggerating a bit, but my hands get tired quickly from typing. I think that I strain them b/c the table is too high and therefore I am resting my hands on the keyboard too much. I just moved the keyboard to my lap and that actually helps. I am a semi computer nerd. I know about software, and how to use the web. However, I am not a hacker, and my knowledge of hardware is not the best. maybe average. I can build my own computer, or do anything illegal. but put a program in front of me, and I will either know how to use it, or else I will figure out how to use it fairly quickly. I am glad that this about finished. It is actually tiring trying to keep up with what I am thinking. I just finished psych class and so I decided to stop at the pcl library and do this before I forget. I meant to do these assignments this weekend, but I forgot. actually, I just didn't get time. My best friends online boyfriend came to Houston this weekend, and I am friends with him too, so I wanted to meet him also. He flew in from Anderson CA. quite far. We had never met him before now. He is really nice too, only. he is a bit inappropriate acting, in that he was feeling me, and he even French kissed me. he felt on Amber (my friend) too, and kissed her more. but the point is, his hands should only be up one person's shirt. and that is Amber, not me!  I hope that this won't really get published b/c this stuff about Giovanni is not something that I want everyone to find out about. He was still really nice, and I liked him. just not romantically. I guess maybe he is just like that. I did tell Amber about what happened. I needed to, if she didn't mind(which, for some reason, she didn't), then it's all good. well, 'cept that I don't want him to kiss me, or feel up my shirt or in my overalls. That is why I won't let him do it again. however, I don't know when or if I will see him again, so it may never come up. Anyway, time is up, so I am gonna submit this thing, and hike it back to the dorm. actually the dorm isn't too far!  I might sit outside and read the paper before going back though. It will depend on how I feel. Okay, here it is. hope it was helpful, or served the purpose it was supposed to. ",1
67,"Stream of Consciousness  Well here I am. I wonder why the professor asked us to do this? I had to do this once before. I can't remember what class it was for. I think it was for English class. I liked my English teacher. I think her name is Mrs. Siskovic. She was a good teacher. She sounded when she read to us. I'm glad I took that dual credit English class, now I don't have to take English in college. That is one less thing to worry about. I wonder if I turned off the oven? Oh yeah, I did. I can't believe I left the refrigerator open all night. I'm just glad my milk didn't spoil. I just bought it. At least I don't think it spoiled, it tasted pretty good in my cereal this morning. I need to buy more cereal. That new cereal is pretty good. I think those fish sticks upset my stomach. I think next time I'll buy fish fillets. I like fish and fishing. I wonder if there is any place to fish around here. I think lake Wytnie is close but I'm not sure. Then again it be far. I don't know what to get my girlfriend for her birthday. I think I'll get her a card, some flowers, and take her out to dinner. I really miss her. I hope she goes to St. Edwards next year so she will be closer and I can see her more often. I can't believe I have to go to ACC next semester to take college Algebra. I must have skipped a question and didn't skip it on the answer sheet. I've already taken calculus in high school and I made an A. I can't believe I scored so low on the SAT 2 math part. I wonder if there is any more Kool-Aid left? I think there is grape, get some when I'm done. I'm real thirsty but he said not to stop once you've started. My hand is cramping. I think this callous on my finger is getting bigger. I hope I can figure out how to get my computer to work on the internet. I guess I'll just ask somebody. I hate to ask people things, especially directions. I think I'm done. ",0
1963,"I am starting over again. I am real mad. I was about 15 min into my first writing and I clinked on some link and this page transferred to somewhere else and everything was lost. That sucks. That sucks. That Sucks. I do not know what else to write. FRUSTRATION. nothing is more annoying. last year at 4 am in the morning my computer froze. I lost 3 or 4 pages of work for a a research paper that was do the next morning. that was infuriating. maybe almost cried. probably not. about as angry at myself as I have ever been though. bloodied my hand on a wall I was so mad then. I'm not angry enough now to hit anything. it is only twenty minutes and I have done nothing all day. the link I clicked was so stupid. it was in my friends profile. quotes from my calc teacher last year. they weren't funny when I read them. I knew they wouldn't be anyway. but I had to click on the damn link. wish I could get that moment back. about one hundred quotes and not one was funny. the kid who made this list of quotes has way too much time on their hands. not that I don't. it is 4 in the afternoon and the only time I have been out of my dorm is too get food. nothing else so far. that is pretty sad. staring and tvs and computer screen hurts my eyes. throbbing is only word I can think of to describe my feeling. feel like going back to bed. I sleep way too much. winamp. music. weezer. play. el scorcho. god damn you half japanese girls. do it to me every time. all the red heads said you shred the jello and I'm jello baby. two won't talk won't think of me. I'm the epitome. I can't keep up typing the song lyrics. I had it going good for a while. I asked you to go to the green day concert. you said you never heard of them. I'm not going to tey and type lyrics anymore. I'm not in the mood for weezer. stop. change. bela fleck. something anyone can always listen too. no lyrics to tey and type at least. locks of dread. I hear drums and some weird keyboard type instrument. I'm not really sure. definitely a bass and maracas or something of that nature. not important. great song. I feel better. one of few songs that can make me feel better by listening to. I wonder how many words I spelled wrong/typos. go back and check. NO. ha. not that important. this is my stream of conscious. I don't think this is working. would I normally think about these things if I was not trying to record thought. only thing I think I am really thinking about is what I am thinking or what I should think next. maybe not. I confused myself. somehow I went to a page of lines or something. when I went back my time clock started at zero again. I am going to have to estimate my twenty now. why my page went squiggly line. I have no idea. I hate computers, they think they can just do whatever they want. freeze throw pop ups at you, turn off, and a million other things. machines will take over. judgment day is near. no. but terminator 2 could be greatest movie of all time. my occupation is to do what I like - this os my friends away message. a lyric of a song we both think is hilarious. glad to see him with that away message. the stars are bright and big at night - deep in the heart of texas ( clap clap clap) pee wee hermans big adventure. a lot better than big top pee wee. my friend just send me instant message: do you have a pic of prof account. "" he is mad I don't understand him. I'm sorry but I don't. me means a pickaprof. com account. I have never even heard of this. should I have. I have no idea. I guess I don't really care. well after accidentally hitting back my time is messed up again and I am going to say it has been twenty minutes. I wonder if I did this right. were these thoughts too forced. ",0
432,"Why do we even have computers if they are  so slow and crappy and can't hold more than ""X"" number of people at a time. time. And why can't I put Chip Smart out of business. They sold us a computer that doesn't work worth a crap. We had to replace the sound card and the modem. modem. I am pretty ticked off right at the moment. I don't feel like writing this assignment. I had to buy First Aid 98 to get the new modem to work. It just started working after a long and horrid battle so I am not in the mood for battling for a space on the computer to finish this assignment. Why does this class have to be so complicated in lecture and textbook reading. I don't care about every method in psychology just give me a briefing. I hope you really aren't reading this, because I am in entirely too grumpy of a mood to write anything that makes sense. I can think of nothing else but the immense dislike I have for my computer. I should name it Lucifer. Let me tell you a little about myself. I just got married Aug. 8. Therefore I am thinking about my husband, especially because he just walked in the door of our apartment at Bridge Hollow here in Austin. I miss my father. His birthday was 9-7 and I forgot!!!!!!!  I felt like crying all day. I miss my mother too. Her birthday is coming up in February. (2-5-51)  I truly don't know my father's age. He is older than my mom I know. They divorced when I was 5. After that I guess I lost count. I was adopted  here in Austin at Marywood. I was extremely lucky, because I got the best 2 parents in the whole world!  I truly mean that. I love them. I also miss my brother. He is in the Waco Youth Center right now doing much better. He wants to start working on his career now. He had a hard time with a lot of things, but he sure is strong. He is 3 years younger than me and is learning disabled. He had a hard time in highschool, but let me tell you that when it comes to technical and architectural knowledge, talent and ability, he is awesome. This center will help him get a job at what he is good at and that he will enjoy. Well, as you can probably tell I love my family. More importantly I love God because He sent His son Jesus to die for my sins and because I accept Him, believe in Him, and in return I have given Him my life to use me for His glory. Time is up. ",1
48,"This is a stream of consciousness paper for my psych. class. That is the only class I actually enjoy going to. They have about a katrillion people in that class and it is freezing cold, but that's okay. Almost all my classes except for English have 456,897,456,789 people in it. There is a cute guy in almost every single one of my classes, or if not in class, on the way to it. That's what college is all about. That's why I came from Louisiana to Texas. New people. It's so different out here. I love my roommates. They are so cute, and have really cute friends. I have one that is my favorite though. That's Gibby. He's so cute. anyway Lisa is so mad that the damn computer won't work. I believe that is a direct quote. She want to go call Adam, her lifeguard lover. Sometimes I think she's jealous because I found my little Gilbert within 5 days of coming to the great state of Texas. At first I didn't like it here, but now I love it. I know 345,231,859,635 guys, and about 4 girls. Today I got to go with Brady, our fine neighbor to go wash his Rodeo. I got to vacuum. It was great. I love him. But not as much as I (secretly) love room 1432.  The bus rides have been hell, but we ride with the neighbors. I hate to stand up. I hate that almost as much as I hate not sitting on the end of a row in class. I think it's the extra elbow room that I get. I hate those desks too. I am used to having about 565 sq. feet of desk area. Oh well. Anyway, yesterday, I bought Gibby some boxer shorts. I gave the salesman a hard time because I didn't know any of his sizes. oh, well. I don't want  to limit myself so soon after coming to Texas. I want someone to play with, but I also want some time to explore the great wide dating field. There is a nasty rumor going around the apartment saying that Marc likes me. I think Marc is an awesome guy, but I don't know how willing I am to give Gibby up. It has gotten to the point where everyone asks me where Gilbert is, and what he's doing. Okay, I may talk to the boy but I don't know every single blessed move he makes. Now as for Dark Chad across the street I would like to know. He is so cute and artsy and he is an avid fan of party girl. okay I think my time is up, so Ill say good bye till tomorrow.

1624,"     Why I'm I here typing when i could have gone and eat? When   does my next class start? I hope my mom left me some food for   tonight. I got to call my friend to go work out. My stomache is   growling. That girl over there look so cute, i want to go up to her and   introduces me, but i'm scared. Maybe i'll have the gut next time. I   can't wait for this week to be over with, but I'm not ready for the exam   next week. what do i have to do for tonight?  Do i have to pick up my   brother today from football? What time is my fraternity interview. I   hope i get accepted. What's the guy next to me is doing? This writing   assignment is so long!  I don't know what else to write. Oh,   tomorrow is the one year anniversary of the terrorist attack on the   world trade center. What i would do to stop terrorism and Bin Laden.  I can't wait for the fall semester to be over with so i could go to   Californnia and visits my cousins and relatives. I missed them so   much. I'm so exhausted from weight training class. I'm so tired.  What worse is I have to walk all the way from Gregory Gym to the   Union going up so many steps. I walked so much. Why does all my   classes have to be so far apart?

1486,"I can hear my roommate clicking on her mouse as she searches for something over the Internet. She's doing her homework, which, to me, seems overwhelming. It's not like high school where even the hardest classes were easy. They were all just blow off courses to me. I never had to really work because the teachers never really graded. College is different though. It's real. High school never counted for anything, but college can determine your whole life. That is what worries me. I feel that one little screw up can ruin my entire life. I have so many worries, so many fears of the future, of making a wrong turn. Man. I look at it now and run into a corner, trying to hide from it. I remember I use to think high school was important, but it never was. I always felt I wasted my high school years. I should have spent more of it doing things I shouldn't have been doing, not doing things I should have been doing. I could have had more fun, I guess. I did have a lot of friends, though. But, I recently met an acquaintance from high school; he didn't think I had any friends. How sad, I thought. He thought I was a loner and made me name all my friends. I didn't even get through half of them, and he said to stop. It's strange. This is the guy whose motto is don't judge. He judged. Everyone judges, even those who promise they won't. I guess in a way he's a hypocrite, but everyone is a hypocrite. That's what's wrong with this world. Society always makes rules, they tell others don't do something, but yet, they still end up doing it themselves. My friend told me that if evil didn't exist then there could be no good. There would be no standards for good. That's very true, I thought. Everyone would always be on the same ground, and no one could be called a genuinely good person. That wouldn't exist and the happiness from finding one who is actually genuinely good wouldn't exist either. Then there's one less thing to be happy about in this world. We need all we can get. There are to many starving people in this world, too many sick, dying, thirsty. There are always abundances where they aren't wanted and not enough where it is wanted. Like recently, Australia was overcome with huge floods. I remember having to take off my shoes and roll up my pants to walk through a river that wasn't supposed to be there. Dead fish floated in it because the water was so cold. There was too much water there, not enough here. But this memory was happy, nonetheless. It was a strange thing that I would normally not have to do. I stood on the tip of my toes with my gear slung over my back and shoulders and walked carefully as to not step on the mounds of dead fish sitting on the river bend. The fish were sad. They died of cold, but in a way it was fascinating to see them. They were being eaten away by bacteria, and their eyes were huge and black, and empty. Their fins were torn up and gills were opened from the bacteria chewing at them. It was horrible, but at the same time fascinating and wonderful. How strange. I'm so against killing animals, but at the same time, something like this is a magnificent sight. I guess that makes me a hypocrite too. No one can avoid being a hypocrite no matter how hard they try. I say I try not to act on my judgments, but I always do, if not then there could be no opinions, and everyone would be naive. In a way though, I have it better than others, I think. I don't see people when I think of them; instead I see the colors I associate with them. How strange, I always think, but that's how I really do see them. I can never see a person unless I actually try to look at their face and when I do, it's strange. It's not familiar. I looked at my sister's face, and even though I've known her my entire life, I was surprised that is the way she actually looks. How strange. My friends think I'm strange for that reason I think. I can't see a person, I can only see their colors, and when I look at a person, they don't seem like the person I know. Because of this, I never look at people anymore. I forget how they look, but I always remember the feeling they give me when I'm around them and the emotions they stir up. I think this is the best way to think. I'm glad I can't see like I'm supposed to. I always have a layer before real sight, and it's wonderful. ",1
1607,"Its been 2 weeks now that I have been in college. I havent made that many new friends, but at least I have been trying. I go and meet new people, peobably most of whom I will never meet again, but it's fun still to just go and meet people. I look at my friends from high school, and they just sit around with each other. To me, they don't seem to be getting the new life experience, high school all over again. I think college will be a great time to see new things in my life. Maybe figure out what I want to be as a person. As far as girls, there are many on the campus, but I don't know how many I have a chance with. Sometimes, I feel like my religion holds me back, but I know its something that I want to keep. Its like a respect factor. I hope the girl is out there. I do regret sometimes when I know I should go talk to girl, but instead I just go somewhere else. Im not that shy, but I feel girls always think they're being hit on. THe better thing to do is to go for it anyway, and who cares what they think. THe things that happen during this time in our life, I wonder if this stuff really even matters that much. I mean how much is this stuff really going to affect me later on, or should I even bother with all this stuff. People tell me that it does matter and its all part of life, but I don't really know. I think sometimes I think to much about what other people are thinking. Like act differently towards different people, which something i don't like doing. Also, i think I judge too quickly. I finally opened the door to the my dorm yesterday; stupidly I didnt do so before. I met some people, they seemed pretty nice. I want to meet some girls though, so if nothing else, my confidence will be boosted up. I usually not really needing self-assurance, but what can i say, it is a bit different here. As far as Jennifer goes, well im trying to be friends with her. I think I can be, it doesnt really matter anymore. I think she finally realizes it as well. In life, I think we all make many friends, so it doesnt really matter that much I guess. Also, I noticed when I make a point I think about the opposite as well. Like maybe I should try to stay friends with her, what if she turns out to be a life long friend. I like it when Im just in a relaxed mood, when stuff doesnt bother me. Just chilling and not worrying about anything. SChool hasnt been that bad so far; I know I need to pick it up. Studying hard right now will pay off for me a lot. I guess writing in a journal does help. It makes me feel releaved of some emotions. I want to go to that party tonight, but I don't know how I will get there. Psychology class should be fun, I like the material we are covering, hope it's not too hard though. Im worried about calculus, that class is going to be tough. Sheena, well i don't know about her. She's cool, but I don't know. She's really hesistant, and I don't really trust her. Seems like she's really good friends with a lot of people. I mean I want to make some new friends, meet some nice girls, and make good grades. Simple goals. This 20 minute segment is really long. Im getting tired of writing. I want to go club tonight, i hope i can get a ride up there. I have study too, so if i don't i can always just study. All the same. ",1
124,"I am very frustrated with this computer. I am the most computer illiterate person, and for this day and age, that is no good. I want to check my e-mail but it is telling me my password is incorrect. I am famished right now. I have had this job on my mind all day. I really want to teach dancing but she wants me to teach tap along with ballet, jazz, and cheerleading. I am not the most qualified person to teach tap and I feel I would be doing my students a great injustice be teaching that class. Also she has me working on Saturdays and if I ever want to go home I will have to find a substitute teacher. This is going to take up a lot of my time and as a freshman I need to make the grades. Especially around finals I will need time to study and that is when the studio is going to have a winter show. That means I would have to choreograph six dances and find music. But the thing is I really want to teach dancing like I did back home. This is such a hard decision because I already accepted the job and I feel bad backing out on Sherri, the owner. I guess after writing all of this out there are more cons than pros. My friend Chad is sitting next to me and he keeps asking me how to spell words. He is interrupting my train of thought. I love typing on computers I just don't know too much about them. I really want to check my e-mail. My dad me something and I would like to read it. I think I'm hungry for Chinese food tonight. But chips and hotsauce sound so good. Really I think I want Italian. I can always eat Italian food. I guess it is since I am almost 100% Italian. The food a Jester is really bad. I have been living off tuna and speghettios that I keep in my room. You know I think I'm going to quit my job that I just got two days ago. I really need to call her right now but I'm at the Flawn, so I will do it when I get home. My arm is kind of  hurting from typing. Maybe I have carpal tunnel syndrome. Just kidding. I was looking for the submit button but I'm not sure which one it is. I'll have to ask Chad. He is my boyfriend and my best friend. I wasn't sure if I would want a boyfriend my first year of college, but right now I am glad I have him. I think a lot of it is we are more like friends most of the time. Or really a lot like brother and sister. But I love him. Well I have a lot of other homework and studying I can be doing so this is the end of my thoughts. Well those will never end but this is the end of me recording them. Bye!     ",1
1987,"My heart is beating so fast. that's probably not good. I'm actually getting . I just sprayed. nervous about writing this. I keep messing up on the whole typing aspect, so I have to stop and go back to fix things. deep breath. this music is so pretty. I wish I had an amazing voice like Alice Ripley. I totally just got a shiver from the notes they were singing. ohhh, her voice just squeaked, but it add emotion. That's so amazing. I just pooped my back, that feels all strange. geez, my computer just did this whole weird Sticky Keys, what was that? You should have chosen . such an amazing song. That note he sings, it's gorgeous but he says it as EWWWW instead you. that irritates me. I  don't even now the words. If only he really loved it would. wow, that was amazing harmony. I hope that ticket stuff gets there. I want to be this part so bad, why aren't there any theaters auditioning for this musical. My jaw keeps popping. Why am I yawning so much? Nose, itch. That's so funny, Chris Noth totally looks like Sam the bald eagle from the Muppet Show. I guess I have to go help Kristin out tomorrow before. I don't feel good. class. That guy today was such an annoying, rude and evil little man. All condescending and all. I got to stop thinking about that otherwise I'll obsess over it, like I always do. I love that note. it's so high and she sings it so amazingly. I can't believe it's the same girl who sings the part of Ariel in the Little Mermaid. He doesn't love her, guys suck. I mean ya she was a Siamese twin, and you know, but I mean he loved her, but because he couldn't live knowing someone else was there he dumped her. I'm so cold. God, why do I keep yawning. I've only been doing this for twelve minutes. My hands are so cold. My nose keeps running. Ricola cough drops are so good. I need to clean up. Of course, I'm not the one shedding and leaving hair ever. on the floor, in the shower. it's so gross. He doesn't love you that's why he is hesitating. Ever time I listen to this, I still get emotional. It's so powerful, I don't know I just connect with them. I think it has something to do with the emotions that you can hear and almost feel through the singers voice and the music. Gosh, my eyes itches. or is it itches. hmmm. I don't know. Ewww, something total floated across the floor. could it be hair. I think so. I know it's definitely not mine. It's so gross. Why did Sarah come in here and ask if I was singing. She acted like I should be ashamed. I can never tell that harmony. I want to learn it so bad. These ant bites are really painful. They're all scabby. is that how you spell that. because I kept itching them. My stomach is all nervous like. it's because I'm all nervous about this assignment. and that stupid accountant jerk. I hate accountants. weird folk they are. I am totally finished with this assignment and I'm going to sing, and watch Much Ado About Nothing. yea! ",0
2240,"I got home from Burnet today from hunting and it wasn't that great. The dove weren't flying when I was there maybe its because I'm bad luck. Sometimes I think stupid things like that, like maybe for instance people were catching fish before I got there then when I got there I didn't catch anything and neither did anybody else. Super smells really good right now I think mom is cooking mashed potatoes and ribs. Sounds really good because I'm so hungry I haven't eaten all day. Speaking of not eating all day I just realized how fun my weekend was. That's why I haven't really eaten that much. Food sounds so good. Friday night I went out to a few parties and tried to get into frat parties but they're all gay and wont let any dudes in. Even though it was me with a bunch of girls they still wouldn't let me in. I'm pissed. From now on when I have a party I'm not letting any frat people in just hot sorority girls. Some of my friends are in sororities they seem cool. Anyway, then I went to the UT game on Saturday and we stomped all over North Texas. I kind of felt bad but not really. Its weird to be at a UT game and say ""this is my school. ""  I'm so used to being in high school and going to high school games I'm not used to seeing 80000 people at a game for my school. I wish school didn't involve class. I love the college atmosphere but not the class part. Maybe my psychology professor will give me an A. That would be great of him. He's a cool guy though I like his class. All my other professors are boring but he knows how to have fun while he lectures. I'm glad I got out of my calculus class and in a different one because professor radin is not cool at all. he needs to learn how to be not so uptight. My new calculus professor is cool though he's more laid back and knows how to teach things and give examples. Gosh I'm hungry I wish dinner were ready already. Taco Cabana is really good late at night I just realized that. I'm glad it's open 24 hrs because where would I go eat at 3 a. M?  Speaking of Taco Cabana San Antonio was fun I just wish we went to Cowboys and danced a little. San Antonio was cool but not as cool as burnet I want to hurry up and go hunting again. maybe this weekend I'll go back and shoot some more birds. Girls make me so mad. Why does a certain somebody have to be stupid all the time?  She bitches too much at me for little things. I should just not talk to her anymore. I don't know why I can't just not talk to her. All girls are the same to me, they all bitch about stupid things and get mad at you for saying hi to other girls that are your friends but they go off and say hi to their guy friends and expect us not to get mad at them. It's dumb. Jenna is dumb too. She should have ditched her boyfriend to hang out with her quote best friend Kelly on her birthday. She is stupid for choosing someone she just barely met over her best friend. Kelly doesn't deserve to cry I should yell at Jenna for that. Jessica is a cool girl she cares about me and doesn't want anything to happen to me I should hang out with her more. Stony Point football will always suck. They lose too much. New coaches are cool though I wish he was there when I was there. I need to do chemistry homework. He needs to stop mumbling and getting off topic to. My TA pisses me off so much I think I'm smarter than her. All the answers I had were right and the ones she gave me were wrong I can't believe that. 66 on the first hw is crap. there goes my confidence. She's a good looking girl though I'll give her that much but she can't help for crap. hopefully by this weekend I'll have my work done so I can hunt. I really can't stop thinking about hunting. I want to shoot me a deer I've never shot one before. Season opens soon I think so dove will have to do for now.        ",1
2115,"My roommate and I have Office Space"" on. What a great movie. It cracks me up every time I watch it. I really like my roommate. She is such a cool girl. It's weird how things work out. I was really scared about having a potluck roommate. Every day we find new things that we have the same. We have the same toothbrush, hairbrush, hair straightener, contact case, pair of pajama pants, caboodle for our makeup, pair of shoes. It's crazy. I really like living at SRD. The food was really good tonight. We had this thing called ""mexican shrimp"" except it really didn't taste like mexican. It was just little shrimp in this sauce with red and green peppers over rice. Food is so good. I bought some Little Debbie Star Crunch and some Vanilla Wafers at the store today. Little kids snacks are so much fun. I wanted some fruit snacks but they cost too much. Meghan (my roommate) and I are not having a good experience with fridges. Our first one leaked all over the carpet so we bought a new one but it gets extremely cold and halfway freezes our stuff. This morning I got out a Dr Pepper and it was all icy. We should read the manual and fix that. I'm excited that I am going home tomorrow for the weekend. I miss my family, especially my sister. This past year we were closer than we had ever been and then I had to leave. I don't have class on Fri so I am going home to see her cheer at the Garland football game tomorrow night. I'm so proud of her. She is so cute and nice and always succeeds at the things she does. I also want to see my puppies. They are the cutest dogs ever and I haven't seen them for 3 weeks. I am also ready to sleep in my own bed. Although my dorm bed is comfortable, it isn't the same. Hahah- gosh I love Office Space. The characters are so messed up and hilarious. I don't know why we have the TV on. I am doing the writing assignment at my computer and my roommate is doing pretesting on her computer and we are both just listening to the TV. I really should go to bed sometime soon because I have an 8am class tomorrow. It was easy for me to get up for high school at 7:30 last year but for some reason I am having a lot of trouble getting up for my classes. I guess I am still in summer mode. Now the credits are rolling on the TV and neither of us is getting up to turn it off. I shouldn't leave instant messenger up when I am doing homework. My friends keep talking to me but I am doing this so I can't talk to them so the boxes just keep flashing at the bottom of the screen and it is really driving me crazy. The music on the credits is also driving me crazy. There is just so much rap music I can take. Oh man! Barenaked Ladies is coming out with a new CD and they are coming on tour to Austin and I am so excited. I love their music so much. I do hope their new album is good because each new one seems to be more pop-ish than the last one. I love their old cd's when they were just in Canada and hadn't crossed over to America yet. Their concerts are awesome and I will be going to the one here. I should probably start saving my money. I guess that means I should get a new job. All I know is that I will never work in food again. I worked at Sonic for 2 years and it drove me crazy. I would come home smelling like grease and who knows what else. Yeah, those I'M boxes need to stop flashing. This is one of the most random assignments I have ever done. I probably sound like an idiot with everything I am saying. I really do like my dorm room. It is so colorful and we have so many pictures and posters up. I can't stand blank white walls. The walls in my room at home are blue so being here with white walls is annoying. I should really put some lotion on my legs because they are itchy. The only problem is that I hate lotion. That is my weird thing. Lotion and feet. Put the 2 together and it is an even worse thing. My sister makes fun of me but I make fun of her because she doesn't like anything touching her bellybutton. She won't even touch her bellybutton. Now our room is completely silent except for the clicking of keyboards. I feel like we need some music or something. I'm glad that meghan and I have similar tastes in musics because I wouldn't want to annoy her with something she didn't like. It's been hard finding a radio stations I like here in Austin because I don't really know which station play what kind of music yet. I guess I have plenty of time to learn. Well- my time is up!   ",0
1241,"I have so much reading to do. It seems in all of my classes the professors are overwhelming us with material. But I guess that is to be expected in college, or at least that's what they told us. But I will persevere. I did have above a 100 GPA in high school. So this shouldn't be too hard. But I have to maintain a 4. 0 to please myself. That's attainable too, though. I know myself good enough to know that I will put everything else aside if my grades start to slip. Like last night, I really didn't want to stay in, but I had to catch up on a lot of things. Yep, I'll definitely maintain. No problem. Bye, bye, bye. Man, I hate that song. I wish stupid songs wouldn't get stuck in my head. I've always wondered about the stars. I think it would be the ultimate thing to impress a girl if you took her on a picnic and could lay and look at the stars and point out all the constellations. Hey, then maybe I should take Astrology for my science. After all, I do need two semesters of a science to graduate Business Honors. But I heard that that class was semidifficult, and I need an easy A in my science class. It can't be that bad though. I mean, after all, how hard can looking at the stars be. But in all sciences, they find ways to talk about stuff that I wouldn't have ever imagined could be taught about. Dang, I hate science. All sciences. Well, I guess social sciences aren't that bad. But those aren't really sciences. Just the basic ones bio, chem. , physics, yeah, can't stand those. All right, only ten minutes left. I would have guessed that in ten minutes I would have thought about more stuff. Guess not. What is time? I mean, it is time to us, but why should the universe revolve around humans. I'm sure there are other beings somewhere out there, but we don't have proof. There were those circles in the wheat fields somewhere, but that's not proof. Just some stupid Iowan rednecks trying to get publicity. Just like that kid who is now charging Bobby Knight with abuse. That's so stupid. Just a publicity stunt. It is so apparent to everyone that he didn't do anything wrong. He may have been a little stern in the manner he addressed the kid, but that is nothing that should be brought to the forefront like this. Stupid. I can't wait until college basketball starts, that is the best time of year. Although I go to UT now, I will always be a Duke basketball fan. I have been since I can remember. That's not bad is it? Nah. I enjoy college football, but it just isn't the same to me. I guess it's because college basketball has more action, and because the kids actually care. Not like the NBA. All of them are lazy and just worried about the money, whereas the NCAA the kids play for the name on the front of the jersey, not the back. But I guess there are some players who don't do that. Oh well, I don't care. Bye, bye, bye. Dang, stop it. I need to hook up with a girl tonight. I've been here too long not to have yet. It really gets me how people can have random sex. I'm quite proud to be a virgin, and I will be until I get married. And I know that God will keep me strong. Like my roommate. I just don't understand. Bye, bye, bye. All right. This thing is finally over. One less thing I have to worry about. ",1
25,"As I sit here in my dorm room, I am thinking about what I am supposed to do tonight. I have signed with the fraternity Sigma Alpha Mu and I am not sure what pledging is going to be like. It could be tough and it could be easy. My roommate is here and he is going to take a nap so I need to try to be quiet as I type. I am kind of anxious about this year and what the year will be like. There are so many people here and I am not sure whether I am fitting in well or not. Anyway, I get side tracked easily. I am going to the house at 7 PM and there we are going to be introduced to all the older guys and then we will probably introduce ourselves to the rest of the pledge class. I am anxious to meet all the cool guys who I am going to be spending the rest of my life with in college and hopefully there after also. I miss all my close friends at home. I live in Atlanta Georgia and they are mostly going to UGA but some of them are spread out across the country. I miss my friend Pamela the most and my best friend Michael the 2nd most but hey I hope they come and visit but if they don't oh well. My mom worries me cause she thinks I am doing alot of bad thing s here at school but really IÃ¯Â¿Â½m not and I am being a good kid and trying to make good grades. I miss my little brother too. he is 13 years old and he is in 8th grade. I hope that he is having fun in junior high school cause I know I did. I keep telling him that high school is the best time of your life. He believes me but he cannot wait until next year when he can go to high school. My great grandmother is very sick and she is 97 years old. I went to visit her the day before I left for school and I was thinking that I may never see her again. She has lived a long and happy life and whenever the time comes, I know that god was the one who wanted her up there. M<y roommate is going to nap now for real and I am supposed to wake him up in an hour. I hope IÃ¯Â¿Â½m not still typing by then. The room is quiet now and I am the only one still making noise. My suite mates are all out at class and they will be back soon. I kind of always think about what I am going to be when I get older and when I am married and who am I going to marry and what my profession is going to be. I want to be an orthopedic surgeon but that is very hard to be and I am not sure if I can be that. But I set my goals already and that is my destiny for my future. I want to be successful and have a family of 4 and a nice looking, perfect wife who loves me for who I am not for what I look like or how much money I make. I am ending my stories with a quote :Shoot for the moon cause if you miss you will be amongst the stars. ",1
497,"Ok I'm thinking about old school Nintendo man those were the days, my friend Ryan had a lot more game than I did but I did not meet him till 8th grade and until then I though I had a lot of games, which I guess is saying your happy with what you got till some on else gets more than you and then jealousy sets in but id like to think I've grown somewhat sense then . I remember a science tech class I used to take in 8th grade. all years go back to 1988 almost everything has some tie in my mind to 1988 I don't know why and It pops up o very often. It's Like velma from scooby do all cartoons go back to Velma, I guess you'd have to see Cartoon network to understand it, m thinking of my mom It's odd but I sometimes worry that she worries too much about me, she was really overprotective but very loving, and now I still have feelings like hatred for being held back by her over protectiveness. SO whenever we are together I try to make sure she doesn't think I turned out goo because some how I still feel a grudge against her methods and think I missed out too much when I was little. nnnnnnnnnnnn captain N that was a cool cartoon. hmmm I wonder I caryn is around or Selena they are kind of friends of my best friend so It kind of awkward but I think they really like me more than I deserve because Ryan always says things to them about me and well I'd like to get to know them better but It awkward because he was friends with them first . I reorganized my room this ear it pretty cool. Something you just don't turn in for a grade even if you think it wont be read but just let it be known I'm thinking f those things. well enough of that what is on my mind. the lawnmower man. that doctor guy who look like a gu from that x-files rip off kieger or something. the At tem a crack force of firearms specialist design to heighten an experience, if I can't even understand now that was true stream of conscience I lost complete control let me try again, Hotdogs, mustard, ice cream, maybe I'm hungry, barbecue chips, why the hell did I just think of feminine hygiene product , milk ducts, cows, chickened, crunch, superheroes, dad comics, pride, going monkey zoo hen turkey target where I work love in the zoo with oink hungry I ran and bombings in Libya contra scandal the e president a cool president I like if only to be rebellious and also the Kennedy's stereotypical drinkers which I will be partaking in he festivities to night but you know that's ok I guess I finally got that damned questionnaire filled out after I thought it had not saved because it read 0% when I logged in again but I guess I was just being an ass. I don't like it when I'm ignored I know I act stupid and say silly things a lot but oh well that guy Joe next door is doing something Damn I think I really want a girlfriend again it really sucks not being able to act straight around girls I just have to stop being shy and be suave but less rryohoyoho a pirates life for me and al I can say is that the future is looking bright and I've got to got rrahhh rrahhh run away tommyboy is a really good movie despite what people might say I think it s really funny at a lot of parts well looks like my time is running up so I ill go tell no one or else I will probably be embarrassed.

2000,"Here it goes. 20 minutes seems like a long time but I don't have to think really. Wait, that is the whole purpose. Think, Think, Think. The game my roommate plays all the time distracts me from studying but I would never say anything. Just let it be, let it be, whisper words of wisdom, let it be. Well, I see the football schedule on my desk and it reminds me that a girl from home may be coming up this weekend. Hopefully I can get her a ticket to the game. Maybe I will make a sign and put it by the elevator that say that I will buy a ticket for, lets say, $10. I think that should work. Ever since I came here I have been having trouble keeping the stupid elastic sheet on the mattress. It always comes off. It really annoyed me, I mean really annoying. So, when I went home this weekend I bought these straps that hold the sheet to the mattress. I have installed them and could not be more pleased. I have beat the mattress! Victory is mine! Its interesting that I can see all of my class buildings from my dorm room window. Pretty decent view. Tonight, I worry that I am too behind in my classes. Yet, I can't imagine that everyone in the class is. I mean, I do a pretty decent amount of work. I bet I am about equal with most students. The part that has me worried is that all of my professors say that most people make Cs in there class. That is just not acceptable. I have to go graduate school. How hard is it to go to graduate school? I really don't know. I can't be that hard. Or is it? 11 more minutes what to talk about. My suitemate just started the shower. I can hear the water running. I also hear the gun shots from that game my roommate always plays. Pow, Pow, Pow. That must be fun. I, however, am trapped in this writing screen. Write, Write, Write. Like a machine. Now I hear jazz music. I've never really met anyone who like jazz music. This kind of reminds me of Catcher in the Rye. Maybe Holden Caulfield was just a steam of consciousness. I wish I had a hunters cap to put on. Maybe I could go to the pond and see if the damn ducks were still there. Where do they go in the winter, anyway? Does someone come in a van and take them away to a zoo or something. Or do they just fly away, fly away. Ah! I've received an instant message. I can't read it yet. Must type, type, type. 6 minutes left, almost there. Nope, that is still a long time. I just noticed my rubik's cube. One side is completed, the others? You guessed it, INCOMPLETE. Maybe one day I will finish it. Ok, now my hands are beginning to tire. 4 and a half minutes left. Just keep typing. My neck hurts too. This is making me sleepy. I really want to go to sleep after this. Ah, that would be nice. BUT NO, I have to read. Lots of reading actually. In fact, psychology, 1 chapter. Pow, Pow, Pow. He says, Missed the head. "" What does that mean? Head makes me think of beer. That lager has a good, hearty head. Nice, only 1 and a half minutes left. I'm really looking forward to this being over. I guess there are harder things I could do for a grade. Like, I can't think of anything. I thoughts a clogging because I keep looking at the clock. Oh wow, here we go, and I am done! ",0
643,"the computer is not very easy for  me type on I would never say anything because me dad bought it for me I love my dad. he really got the shaft at work elaine is a horrible person. mom is so protective of dad its only been two minutes I wonder if I can think for twenty minutes I bet I do all the time and don't even notice,  this is hard because I think about more than o ne thing at once and they aren;t really complete thoughts just flashes in my haed but I know what thay mean. I should have taken a typing class in high school. the sky has really pretty simpson clouds I wonder what I have to do in all my classes am I doing thi right I need to be more organized I've been thinking about being organized all day I can't stop thinking about the living room curtains and a file box for my papers. maybe 15 it too many hours I hope I go to bio this chair really bugs me because it doesn't fit un der the desk. I should buy a different one I don't think I have enough money for all this stuff. where am I going to get money. maybe I should have gotten a job instead of taking another class I was thinking of something and now I forgot it. I wonder if adam and I will get married he would be scared if he knew I said that I sound like a stupid teen ager out of the 50's when I say that. I would marry him if I had to though I think I probably do really love him I dn't get sick of him I could be with him all day and I don't even notice I hope nothing bad happens even for a while my parents made it through college but they had a few fallouts. I hope we just marrily make it along untill we're old and gray but I know how nieve that is. did I spell nieve right I wish I had a better spelling sense I guess I could blame it all on my first grade teacher but that seems silly. my room mate came in I hope we are good friends. I really like her but I don't know how to make friends with people. I wonder why I can be friends with kids and poeple I don't think are important but its hard for me to be friends with people I like and want to be friends with. I fell like I'm coming on too strong but then I hold back and they think I don't like them. also people told me I'm not very approachable. I guess thats good because I don't like when random guy come up to me. I don't know how to get out of it without being really rude. cheryl is so perfect she can do what she wants and she is always so polite. tricia was like that too. I wish I was in 8th grade again for a day. whenever I think of middle school I get kind of queasy and real mad at my mom what a horrible time. I couldn't even get within a certian field of the house or I would sense a horrible aura. when I had to go I would force my self and run to my room and be a nasty depressed person. on day the church lady cought me running to the creek and I think she was genuinally concerned.

1530,"     I am really tired right now. I don't know why I am so tired. I really shouldn't be this tired. But I am. The weather outside is really dark and moody to me. It makes me tired I think. I am kind of mad at my friend because she told me that she was going to come pick me up and take me out but she bailed out. That is no good she is often times doing that. I can't help but think of what is wrong with me when I have to write for a psychological purpose. I think about what is wrong with me a lot. I filled out the pretest thing a little while ago and it was interesting to see where the questions were going. There is where the bias coms in I guess-- knowing that you are thinking for someone that is going to evaluate this eventually. I want to go running (there is a track outside) but I don't have the will power to do it. Dieting is a lot easier than having to run. I like my dorm room a lot. It is very cozy and nice. My roomate is an okay guy so far, we have only had 1 run in so far. But there will be more I think. A lot more. We are very diffrent on how we approach things. I am a die hard liberal and he is a film major that just doesn't want to really take a stance. I don't know why that is. I have always been a liberal but sometimes I can be considered fiscally conservatice but incredibly socially liberal. I mean I am under the impression that one should let people do what they want with their bodies if they have the mind ability and ultimately the autonomy. I am really bad at grammar. I really really am. I don't know what I am so bad because I want to be an English major-- but alas I just am really bad at it. I really like being able to type really fast. It makes me happy. Very very happy. I worked at a law firm taking dictation for a period of time and it was somehow-- in a masochistic fashion- fun. I am really nervous right now. This is college. The big C. This is what I have been looking forward to for my past 18 years of life. And now I am here. I am a freshman and sometimes it can be intimidating. I am the kind of person that likes to always be right, and always the smartest at whatever I do; but I don't know if I can be that here. There are so many people. It gives me a really bad inferiority complex. Like a really bad one. And most of all-- that is what I hate; not being in some way special. I feel guilty at times because I think that I am being egocentric. Well, I know that I am egocentric. My entire world is based upon my own little perceptions and the like. I don't know why. I would change it if I could. But it ain't possible. I hate being stupid. That is my biggest fear, well I guess it is, of being stupid. I would hate to be stupid. It would be bad. My roomate is talking to me right now. And I have to do this right now. But I guess it messes up an authentic stream of consciousness. I am also a bad speller. I remember when I was younger that I misspelled spell, and my teacher thought that I did it on purpose. Very, very embarissing. I might want to be a poet. but really I know that I am going to be a lawyer probaly. I guess I will like it. I am kind of superficial at times and I need money to be happy. I hear people say all the time that they could be just happy as can be without money. and I don't believe that. I am just shallow. A poet makes no money really. Notoriety is also big with me in my ambition, but ultimately money is what I need. I guess that with money, everything to me seems possible. I don't know why that is. When I was younger my family always had a fair amount of money. I got a lot of things that I wanted. I guess I am the anomaly to the saying,   those that grow up with money; spite it. And those that have no money; crave it   That really isn't a. what is it called. crap. . now I can't remember what it is called. It is a literary term. I use it a lot. Ummm. . . okay. . a terse statement filled with wit. Ahhhh. . this is really going to bug me. hmmmm. it is called a. well it starts with an A. . Wait. I have to look it up. APHORISM!!!!. . thank the lord. it toom me forever. Very happy that I remembered. Time is almost up. The twenty minutes is slowly coming to a close. I guess I wrote a lot. It wasn't constant there at the end. I had to look that word up. It would have driven my crazy if I couldn't have remembred. ",0
1902,"So I'm laughing right now because I think this is really weird. Makes me feel kind of uncomfortable I guess, I don't know why though. But my stomach kind of hurts right now, my roommate and I just had some ice cream, so maybe that's why. I'm kind of stressed right now, and I hope I get everything I need to get done done tonight. I'm really tired and I just want to go to bed. I'm really hot in my dorm, maybe I should turn the fan on, but I'm too lazy to get up and do that right now. So I'm wondering what my boyfriend is doing right now. I talked to him a few minutes ago and he was doing homework. I wonder what homework he has?  Man, I'm really not looking forward to tomorrow. I have so much stuff to do, at least that's what I feel like. And I really want to go to TOPS to look at the pictures. Hopefully Claire will go with me tomorrow and do that. My foot is really itching me, I think I got bit by a bug tonight at the ZETA house. I was outside doing my homework which was probably not a good idea, but oh well. Oh I need to call my parents too. I wonder if they're having a good time in Canada. I wish I was there right now. I miss them already, but I'm only three hours away so it's okay. I'll be fine. I really want to go running outside on the track tonight. It felt so good out earlier and I bet that would help with my feeling stressed out. But I probably won't because I'm so tired and my stomach still hurts. I wonder what's wrong with it. Twenty minutes is a long time, I've only been writing for seven minutes now, wow. I hope I have fun this weekend. I'm excited about the UT football game. The last game was so much fun even though it was raining. I guess that made it more interesting. I'm looking at my pictures by my desk now and I really miss my friends from my hometown. I really miss Angie, I hope she is doing fine at Kingwood College. And Justin, I hope he is still not mad at me. Maybe I should call him tomorrow, I think I will. And I can't believe Kristin got her nose pierced up in Colorado. She is a wild one, but I guess that makes her who she is. I wish I was in Colorado. I love the mountains and the nice weather there. I bet she is having a great time at school. I'm spacing out right now. I never thought I could have writer's block when I'm writing about what's going through my head. That's really weird. And I'm saying really"" a lot. I guess I like that word or something, who knows. I need to go to the bathroom, but I only have about seven more minutes, so I'm just going to wait it out. Is going to even a word?  I'm not sure. I'm thinking about tomorrow again and hoping that my TA for Calculus teaches well tomorrow. I can't really understand him and I really need help in that class, so hopefully he will have some good things to say. Our sink in the room keeps on dripping and it's really bothering me. I wish it would stop. Claire just got a phone call, I wonder who it is?  She is a cool girl, I'm glad I'm rooming with her. If I had to room with a complete weirdo I would freak out. That would be horrible. I think she is talking to her somewhat ""boyfriend. ""  They're dating I guess, and I set them up!  I did a good job. I guess he is coming up to our room right now. Claire's excited!  I wish my boyfriend was coming to see me. He lives in Riverside so I understand. I hope Justin doesn't think I'm a complete slob when he comes up here since I'm in my pajamas and have no make up on. Oh well, I don't need to impress him anyways. It just got really quiet in our room. It's an awkward silence because Claire just turned her fan off. She must be cold, but why and I so hot. I just popped my back and it felt so good. It's been pretty sore lately, but I'm not sure why. I just remembered that I have to read after this. That really sucks. It's going to be a long night I guess, but I can handle it. Oh Justin is here now, that's cool. ",1
1362,"The first thing that comes to mind as I sit here is an immense feeling of relief. I have just finished the rough draft of my Rhetoric paper. It's due tomorrow and I wasn't sure I could pull it together. It's not up to the standard of writing I like, but that's why it's a rough draft. I find myself dwelling a lot on on my life since I got here. I know that sounds a little weird, but it's actually a good thing. The first night I was here, I was sitting back listening to my music and reading when I thought about home and everything that had gone on there. I remembered everything from my close friends my senior year of high school to my friends from way back in my elementary school days. It wasn't homesickness. Something about the song I was listening to made me just stop and think about how lucky I am. I've had a great life. My parents were very supportive in whatever I did and still are. My friends were always there for me and I never endured any life tragedies. The truth is that I really have no explanation as to why that song triggered memories of home. It just brought back mental photos of friends, girlfriends, and what I personally considered an ideal life. I really do think I've led an ideal life. Never hurt for money, never abused, never had problems making friends. The only thing I consider a life tragedy is the fact that I didn't get a new car for graduation, but it was that or tuition and I fought to hard to get here to not come. I think that I'll love it here. Actually, I already do. Most people say that you will get incredibly homesick and even want to come home early on in your first year of college. I don't see how. The people around me are great, my classes interest me, and I'm never bored. I don't not miss home, but I'm not sitting in my dorm room crying about the good old' days either. As far as I'm concerned, the good old' days are just beginning. I'm really looking forward to this weekend and the next. This weekend I'm probably going out to a club with a group of girls, one of which I am finding myself attracted to. The next weekend is another football game. I'm in the band, so football games are a fun time for me. Marching in front of 80,000+ people is intimidating, but it's also a rush that words really can't do justice for. Of course, that's only half the fun. The real fun from football season comes from goofing off in the stands. I'm glancing at my clock and see that I've only got about ten minutes left? How am I going to ramble on for another ten minutes. I write fiction stories for fun, love English, and am a Journalism major. Rambling writing style for me. I wonder why I'm occasionally having trouble continuing. Who knows? Psychology is supposed to be able to tell what makes me tick. Maybe one of ya'll will find something interesting about my personality from all these completely random thoughts. This is harder than I thought. Maybe it's because there's not a structure to it. When I write, even a fiction story on my own for fun, there's some kind of structure. A plot, guidelines to follow, something that serves as a skeleton for me to put some meat on. Just writing off the top of my head is something new. Well, not new, but usually the ideas I get off the top of my head are related to a particular subject and I can plug them into a structure. That's actually how I start a lot of my English papers. Start off the top of my head and find a flow. After that, it's all easy, but here there's not even a skeletal structure to set my ideas on. ",1
361,"like a paper boat that's filled with water and slowly sinking. I'm not sure how to describe my thoughts at this particular moment. My thoughts seem to roam from one thing to another in a split second without me actually aborting all the information. I guess what to say is that my thoughts are unorganized like my backpack, all scattered around in bits. What pops up in my mind as a thought is how I'm going to go home after my classes are over for the day and check off the things that I remembered to do and those that I forgot to do. In my mind, all that I can see is my thoughts as a candy and it being surrounded by a mob of ants. My feelings at this moments are being jumpy and nervous at anything I see. I can't seem to calm myself. I also feel out of place and not all there, really unprepared. I guess to say is that I feel like I'm on a roller coaster ride and all alone on it. My sensations are at this moment very glad that the day is almost over and excited about hurrying home. My sensation at this moment also indicate anxiety for the next day and a sign of relief.

1518,"Well i am beginning this assignment and already I'm worrying about spelling errors and constantly hitting backspace trying to fix every little thing. Sometimes I wonder why I care about that stuff but I really don't know, and  my mind just wonders endlessly all the time, which I why I think I will enjoy this assignment, once it has been evaluated, because I seem to conjure up the wildest ideas, and thoughts and feelings when I begin to let my mind roam free. Now I'm thinking why am I thinking about my thinking which seems really weird, but I guess thats the idea of this experiment, and I am constantly trying to think about what to think about next, so that I'll have something to type, instead of leaving a blank screen which would be bad, because then I would get a bad grade, even though the grading system on this particular paper is based on completion, not on content, which is a good thing because if it was based on content, and I had no content, then there would be nothing to grade, and I would have bad grades, and now it just occured to me that I am rambling on about nothing, and making fallacious points as I type, just for the simple reason to keep typing, which is the main goal of this experiment, and I just heard my roomate coughing in the living room, he is foreign, and sometimes hard to understand, but I think it's cool to have a foreign exchange student as a rooomate because it adds a bit of variety to the mix, and he said that his parents live in Yugoslavia, and that he moved here with his host parents who lived in Pennsylvania, but had to move here to Austin for job reasons, which is why he lives here, and which is why he goes to Austin Community College, and I know this because I asked him, and I asked him because I was curious to know about his background due to the fact that he is from a foreign country. He says he likes it here in   the states   as most foreginers refer to us as, but he, like most teenagers, misses his friends back home, which is why he goes back there every summer to visit, and I guess since he has lived both places, and experienced both cultures and economies, is why he chose to major in International Business, and my other roomate, Troy, is a business major at UT, and I am somewhat of a business major, with my major being Sports Management, which is in the College of Education because it is a branch of Kiniesiology, which I don't know if I spelled right, but I supposed I should learn how,  but anyways my major is more of a business major, like Troy and Djordje, which is pronounced George, so that makes 3 business majors in the house which can be helpful at times, then I have another roomate named John, whom I have been friends with since 4th grade when his mom babysitted me, and my mom told his mom that she doubted we would get along because we were two different types of people, but she was wrong because even since his mom moved to Nebraska with him, and his sister Lynnsie, we stayed friends, and then his dad who lived in Houston at the time, moved to San Antonio when I was in 7th grade, yet we still remained best friends, though we only saw each other 4-5 days a year. I figure there is some psychological aspect that has kept us together, and such good friends throughout the years, and I hope to learn more about it if there is such an aspect of psychology. Now it is occuring to me that most of this entire writing is a run-on but I guess that is okay since it is more based on stream of consciousness, rather than stopping to take the time to realize and correct your errors. But anyways, as I was saying there are 3 business majors, then John is a Chemical Engineer also studying at UT, and he, along with me and Troy, who is 22, are all freshman, and Djordje is a sophomore. I sometimes wonder what its like to be a 22 year old Freshman, and to be starting your real life off that late, ever since Troy and I have met. He seems like a very interesting person to me, and I figure I will get to know him better as the year progresses, even though the four of us mostly stay in our rooms most of the time, rather than socialize together, but I guess its just nervousness of being alone, and without parents for the first time, and we will soon grow out of it. Speaking of parents, I hate to admit it, but I truly do miss my parents, and especially my dog, a dauschand, bevo, very much. Before I was to leave to move in to my apartment I couldn't wait to get out of there, and to get out on my own, figuring to be free of them for good, except for the occassional visits, and I would read the college things about how to expect home sickness, and I was thinking yeah right, not me, but just a few days after they had left, I already missed them, and I can't wait to see them again. Pretty sad on my part I guess on trying to be independent, but oh well, I just want to see my dog again, whom my life would be incomplete without, and the funny thing is for the first 15 or so years of my life I was afraid of dogs, and now I see the clock and I'm running of out of time, and it said my 20 minutes are up, so thats all I have to say.

1131,"I don't really know what to think about really anything. I mean some things are so clearcut and others just float off like there is no answer or any point in thinking about them. Why do I cry so much. Why do I need to talk so much why do I need so much. I don't know all the answers and I don' t know all the emotions either, but I do know that sometimes I feel different and like things aren't right. And how do you know when things are right. Is Brian right just because my head is telling my heart that he is cute and cool and what I maybe have been looking for? But then other things I just know are right when Lilly and are goof off and are being silly we have so much fun. But then how will they all think of me when they know the truth and is it really that big of a deal or is it because I make it a big deal. Oh my gosh it has only been three and a half minutes. What is wrong w/ me? My arms will fall off before I finish this writing assignment. But really who will know if I don't tell them but I want to tell people and have them love me and speaking of people I know and love I wonder how Kelsey is I hope she has made some more friends who are girls. I know that I can't be there but I hope that she does make some because she needs to realize she is more than just a body and a set of boobs to them. Or at least I want her to know that and maybe I should just say things like that. Wow my arms hurt. But I have been typing for a while already and the blinking light from AOL instant messenger is going to piss me off so I have to turn it off now. Ah. so much better. Now I can concentrate and not really concentrate wow I love paradoxes. I wonder if you should or rather could say paradox like with the funky ways of making plurals like alumnae and alumna and stuff like that. And is swang really a word when not used as a term for dancing or in the more rural and uneducated parts of the world. And in America how many places are really uneducated and how do we know that we are uneducated. I mean after all who are we to judge. I don't think that there is any person who can judge either other people or themselves. But we all do it and anyone who says that they are not judgmental are flat out lying. I mean really. I am going to try and move my keyboard to a new position to better accommodate my wrists and arms and fingers. I hope that I get a ticket to ou weekend. And better yet I hope I get a date. I would like to go there w/ Brian, but I don't know if he likes me or is just pressured by other people, like my friends, into thinking that I am some kind of cool. I wish I could just know but that is not my place. I don't get to know things. I think he feels obligated and just like the she daisy song I do not want to be anyone's obligation. I have too much pride and maybe I have so much it will hurt me, but I don't want to be anyone's' obligation until they decide themselves that they want to care for me. I don't want a person colossal  who feels obligated to me because of what I have done or what people say about me or whatever I want some one who will want me. Why doesn't anyone want me or do I not let them see me and if I do let them see me am I risking everything I work for everyday to make sure that I have a pretty face to show the world but I seem so unfriendly sometimes like at meetings. I don't try and meet the girls especially the one who looks like Mel's sister because it makes me think bad things. But oh I am a horrible person. Why would anyone want me especially with all this bad karma and not that I believe in karma I just believe in the modern translation that it relates to the soul and goodness and badness and evilness, but I am evil and I have all these negative thoughts and I am not bitter though, at least I pray to God that I am not bitter because bitterness really does breed filth and hatred and unhappiness. I want to be happy and praise God with all of my song and being but all these things get in the way and other stuff and I am so unhappy about stuff sometimes. I just need to cry and I want a big comfy shoulder to cry upon and someone special to hold me tight and say that everything will be all right. that is from some song but that is what I want. I want the security of a guys arms wrapped around me but I know that is not really security that all that is is a cheap imitation of what God can give to me through Jesus. But I just right now would love to be wrapped up in a great big hugpreferably with Brian around me, but I don't know. I hope I don't get obsessive about him like I did with Tony and with Jonathan and so many other people. I just think that things are good and that I feel really comfortable around him but at the same time he reminds me of all the boys I hung out with that were Bass's friends. And that is cool because they were cool but I don't know if I am deep down cool enough for Brian and all of his friends or if I want to try. But I do, but only if it is the right thing and if it is then God will bring it together but I know that I have to do my part and pray and think of what God can do and not worry about other things but it all works out in the end. God keeps us safe. It all works out. ",0
1113,"Where do I start? It's funny how when you are actually telling yourself that you need to think of something that things like pink bunny rabbits come to mind. Why? Right now, I'm trying to reorganize my mp3 collection. I thought that if I added a few new categories like 80s, 90s, country, comedy, etc. , that it would be easier to find what I'm looking for when there is something particular I want to hear. I'm usually in an upbeat mood, especially when I have something to do (like school), so I like to listen to upbeat music. But there are times when only slow music like U2's ""Achtung Baby"" album, or other slower music from the 80s. When I like to listen to these slow songs, it's not like I'm in a depressed mood or anything, it's just that I'm thinking about something intensely personal, I guess. I know that when I was breaking up with my last girlfriend, I listened to this music a great deal. It also helps me to be creative. I have a tendency to write things like poems or short stories when I'm in that mood. So, question. Do I have to have a thoughtful demeanor in order to listen to the slow songs, or does listening to that particular kind of music put my mind into a creative thinking mode? Grin and Bear It. I'm a little intimidated by the amount of students I've come into contact with at this university. 50,000 people crammed into a fairly confined land space can make one feel claustrophobic. I like it, though, because everyone here is my age. There is an endless supply of new friends, new faces, new experiences, new situations. I could say that it's advantage of being so big is also a disadvantage. I've been to my Psychology and English classes a couple of times and have yet to see the same face twice in each. I don't know anyone in this city, so it makes adjustment a little hard. My family has moved around quite a bit, so it's not that I'm not used to being new to something, I just wished I had my best friend here to share it with. Andy. Big guy. Sings. Just like me. Likes the same music. Likes the same movies. Likes the same people I do, except when it comes to women. He disapproves of a great deal of my girlfriends. The few that he does like, I seem to like more, too. Strange, though, how those are the ones that move away or want to see other people. I'm hot. My air conditioner hasn't been working these past few days and the apartment people say that they're ""on it. "" Whatever. Some tenants left a note on the manager's office door (the manager has conveniently not been in, either), saying some pretty mean stuff. I think it's funny, but at the same time I try to put myself in the shoes of the manager. She has many things to think about, I'm sure, but still. 110 on the thermometer is no laughing matter, especially for someone who's not from around here. Not used to the heat. My bike needs to be adjusted. It doesn't shift gears the way it should. Up shifting seems to work fine, but when I down shift, the chain doesn't move crisply. I need to find a new seat, too. Maybe one with a little more padding. I hope the interview with Compaq goes well. Not only is it a big company that would give me lots of opportunities, but George Lucas. I want to work for George Lucas. ",1

1825,"     Hi, my name is Heather Hughes. I am 18 years old. I am Catholic, I   like to play the piano, I miss my family, I miss my friends. I do have   alot of friends that came to UT with me, but I didn't really hang out with   them much in high school because I had a boyfriend and seemed to live a   totally different life than they did. They were on the debate team, I was   on the dance team, I joined every organization there was in high school   because it gave me an explanation as to why my grades were not so great.  All my friends here are really smart, they all graduated in the top ten   percent of the class. My cell phone is ringing now. I really want to pick   it up, but I think it's just my cousin so I'll leave it alone. It kind of   gets on my nerves that she calls my cell phone all the time, instead of my   room number when I told her that when she calls it costs me alot, it's   long distance. I still have the same number from back home, so my mom can   call for free. I had a bad dream the other night about my mom. I dreamt   that she had done something really sweet for me,  and I didn't appreciate   it. All I could think about was being with my friends. When I came to   orientation this summer, I hated it! I called my mom every 20 minutes   telling her that I would rather go to Texas Tech or Midland College, the   community college in my hometown. But now that I'm here, I really like it.  I don't miss her as much as I thought I would. I really miss my   exboyfriend. I think I disliked orientation so much because we had just   broken up. We had gone out all through high school, and he's at Tech now.  That's where I really wanted to go. I got in, and into the business school   too, but I really wanted to be in the honors program. I guess I was a   little conceited and believed that I was smarter than the average student   at Tech. Anyway, I had applied really early and hadn't heard from them, I   waited and waited. I received my letter from UT but it didn't mean   anything to me, because I didn't know anything about this college, none of   my friends were going here, and Kit wouldn't be here. But my parents gave   me a deadline and said I had to decide on a college by March 26 or   something. So, I decided to come here. I think mostly because I was upset   that Tech wasnt' as eager to accept me into the honors college, and I also   thought, tons of couples go to different colleges, and if they can make   it, surely Kit and I can. Well, prom rolled around about 2 to 3 weeks   later, and Kit made prom court. We were both amazed. Because he made   court, he had to learn how to dance and eat properly, and wear a coat and   tails tux, which really didn't look that great on him since he was a bulky   football player. So the day of prom rolls around, and Kit callls about 2   to say that the court got a limo. I thought   Great, now we don't have to   worry about transportation!   But then he said there wouldn't be enough   room for the dates, just the court. So I asked him, am I suppossed to go   to prom alone? And he told me to have my parents drive me! I was so upset   becuase later on I found out the court had a choice to ride the limo or   not, and Kit choose to ride with people he hardly knew than to take me. I   don't know if I'll ever be able to forget how awful he made me feel.  Everytime I think of my prom, I'll always remember that. He also said   during prom , that I had been acting weird ever since I choose UT. That   made me even more upset, because he had never brought it up before, he had   always said, do what's best for you. I didn't know that he thought what   was best for me was him, and not a better education. I miss him so much. I   tried to get back with him this summer,and he said he wanted to too, but   everytime we'd almost get back together, he'd say no. That it would be too   hard to have a long distance relationship. I'm really disappointed in him,   this summer he went and got a tatoo, knowing that I dispise them, and   right before he left for Tech he didn't tell me about it. A week later, I   ran into his parents at Best Buy and his mother told me. Each time he does   something like this I vow this is the last time, I'm through with him, but   I keep going back, thinking about how good it used to be, and I fall in   love with his memory all over again. I wonder if he's dating anyone yet. I   d ",0
2158,"I have been asked to do similar exercises in the past in which I was supposed to just write nonstop and track my thoughts or create a story, a cell phone is going off right now but it is not mine, I just got a brand new phone, it is a really cool camera phone, sometimes I hate having my cell phone because people just won't stop calling me and it gets really irritating, especially if you don't want to speak to the person who keeps calling you. I met this one girl Amy, and she called me so many times but the problem was I was trying to avoid her because I was not' really interested in her. But I didn't want to hurt her feelings because I know there are times when I have felt lonely or hurt myself. Anyways I would rather too many people call me then nobody call me. Last year I didn't have a cell phone and I wasn't really as socially active as much as people expected me to be or as much as my friends were. I really hate the keyboard that I am typing on. I am in the library right now, in the RLM building, I came here to come to a spanish class to see if I could get into a class I wasn't registered for. I promised my mom I would come and check this class out because most of my classes right now are not to difficult and I have a lot of time. Something I am not really used to. Anyways my mom has been bugging me about taking a foreign language for some time now because she desperately wants me to learn something. she owns a translation company and thinks it is vital that I be able to communicate at least in Spanish if I am going to live in texas. I really do agree with her but I don't really want to learn a foreign language. I took french in high school and it was really tough. but maybe that was because I didn't really work hard my first two years of high school and I never really paid attention in class. Maybe I will be better now. Anyways before when I was asked to do similar assignments I never was really able to write anything down. I remember one time I was asked to just write nonstop and then later what ever I wrote about I would use later for the topic of a story. The problem is that I really wasn't able to write anything down at all. Usually when I write something I like to think long and hard about what I am writing about and then phrase whatever I am writing in a very articulate and cleaver way. I am really hungry right now, I never ate breakfast. I usually don't eat breakfast but I usually don't' get up this late on the weekdays. I had a rough night last night. couldn't fall asleep and I didn't wake up till 12:25. I had a class at one otherwise I might have slept later. There are some people passing by me and I keep looking over wishing for some reason that I recognized them or that they went to my high school. my eating pattern since I got to college has taken a weird pattern-back to my no breakfast-I have 14 meal tickets back at the dorm but a lot of times I will only use 5-10 of my meals a week and that is being generous. the first week I had 10 meals left, last week I had 6 or 7 meals left. I am trying to get my brother to come to towers and eat with me, he can use one of my tickets but he won't come because 2 years ago he got kicked out of towers and I guess he is afraid of going back. somebody must have really scared him or something because fear or boundaries are not usually things that get in edward's way. he has no problem breaking rules or trespassing or anything like that if he wants something or wants to have a good time. He is by no means a bad person, he just doesn't like to be told what he can and can't do if he doesn't agree or approve of limitations he also can not work on someone else's time schedule. He use to be different, he use to be such a little goody good, he would follow all the rules and stuff like that he was such a wimp, I use to hate him when we were little and then other times I would love him but mostly I would hate him. Now I think he is one of my best friends-I think that this is because ever since I have been around him in the last year or so he has been really great and accommodating to me, he always makes me feel good and tries to make me feel welcome and special, my parents will say the exact opposite about him, they will say he is selfish and inconsiderate-they fight a lot-and in a lot of ways they are exactly right but in other ways they don't see things that I see. I am really grateful to my brother because in a lot of ways since I have been around him he has somehow taught me how to relax and have a good time. My parents will say that this is his specialty-relaxing and having a good time-they think he is really lazy and can't    be bothered to ever move, but actually I have noticed that when edward wants something he will do whatever is necessary to accomplish his task, since I've been in Austin it has been him who has called me several times to play tennis, and he also is surrounded by his friends and by women-this is not by chance. well my 20 minutes already passed ",0
1089,"My thoughts and feelings at the moment reflect several important aspects of my life. Perhaps, one of the most recurring thoughts has been my progress with my academic success. I am worried and concerned with maintaining an above average status as a student. One other concern of mine relates to my commitment toward studying and learning. I fear that I will not be able to put enough effort into accomplishing my tasks in school and at home. Thus, most of the time I reflect on future and find myself greatly concerned and worried. I feel in great anguish and perhaps, turmoil. I am also very concerned about the financial needs and requirements of college. Often, I feel that college has placed a great burden both financially and emotionally on my parents. This, in turn, causes much sadness for me. Although the social aspect of my life, at the moment, is not a significant matter, I still find myself looking back at the days in high school and at the friends that I left behind. I comprehend the fact that any transition in life accompanies great distress and agitation. However, I find myself more weary and temperamental than distressed or melancholy. At times, I feel as though I have not slept for days. I feel constantly fatigued. I have always realized that I worry to a great degree; and at times that my lifestyle has dramatically changed, this aspect of my personality has in turn worsened. I see myself literally concerned about every trivial matter in life. I worry a lot about my weight issues. Lately, I have noticed a dramatic change in my eating habits. Through the past year, I was able to lose a great amount of weight and maintain it. I was also able to control what I ate in addition to exercising a great deal. However, lately I have deviated from this habitual behavior. I have gained about 10 pounds. I feel greatly out of control. I do not even have the motivation to exercise. Often, I wake up in the morning and find myself critically loathing every aspect of my appearance. At school, I often compare myself with other females and feel greatly embarrassed. My parents and my acquaintances have at times mentioned that I look better now that I am not so underweight. However, I do not perceive or comprehend their point of view. As a result, I promise myself almost every day to lose all the unnecessary weight that I have gained. I even plan a strict diet for the next weeks. However, I never follow through the plan. Although this recurring thought is truly trivial in comparison with matters concerning my education, I still cannot rid myself of the compulsive need to restrict my diet and control my eating habit. I believe that there is great tension in my life at the moment. Perhaps, this is true for a lot of students that have began their first year of college experience. Regardless of my emotional well being at the time, I still seek hope and remedy in studying and experiencing all the knowledge that college has to offer. I am sure that if I put enough effort into my academic advancement I will easily succeed in future. Nevertheless, I truly wish that I could annihilate the worries that accompany me day and night. ",1
240,"My name is Oscar Criel. I really don't know what I'm supposed to write but I guess I'll start anyway while I have some free time. I don't know if we're supposed to word wrap this thing or not so forgive me for the  excessive going out of the lines. I just barely made it here to the Ugl and decided  ""why not and just do my homework while I have time. ""  Today in Psych class it was  pretty boring. I just wish we did something a little more interesting. I took this class because an old girlfriend/friend recommended taking this class. She  told about her Psych class and how interesting it was. So far I like the class  but I wish we could start on some interesting facts. I still haven't bought my  Psych book and I hope I can hang on for one more day. I'm really just worried  about whether my financial aid is coming in. I also miss home already. I decided  not to go home over the holidays so I could stay here and hang out with my friends. But I think I made the wrong decision. Even though I came during the summer I still miss  home. For that whole month in the summer of 97 I just thought about going home. I was in the preview program for the summer but I don't regret being in that program. I met some of the coolest people during the summer than I have my whole  entire life. My old friends seem like dumb asses when compared to the ones I met. I just wish I didn't feel so insecure About Math. I hate Math. I used to be good in it when I was in Jr. High and the beginnings of my high school life. But during my Jr. and Sr. year I really slacked off and got my first C's from my  Pre-cal class and my Calculus class. That's one of the reasons I came during the  summer so I could take Pre-cal. That was one of the worst Classes I have ever taken. I got my first D in the summer and my dad wasn't to happy. He graduated from UT  and he wants me to do the same. I'll try not to disappoint him but I don't know  what the future holds for me. I just wish I wasn't in a major that required taking a  math class. But I hope I get an A average this fall. I better. I just need to work more smarter and know and learn how to study better. Plus I have a work study job now and I hope that doesn't drag me down. I guess It's almost been twenty minutes but  I still got about three more minutes to go . It's weird but I didn't think I could type for a solid twenty minutes without stopping for  a five minute rest or something. One ting I know right now is that I am starving. That damn job is costing me my  lunch. I think I have to start packing a lunch every time I go to work. I need to  buy meal replacement bars when I get my first paycheck. I just hope it's more than a hundred dollars. I forgot but I need to call my dad and ask about the financial aid. I guess I'll call him tonight and maybe he could sort out things. I feel so tired. I just want to go back home and sleep for ever. But I know that wouldn't be the wise thing to do. College sucks. I just wish things came a lot more easier to me. I have no more thoughts. I am just stuck here typing on a computer. Well I better  go eat now and hope that I typed enough for this assignment. One down and one to go. I guess I'll see you in class. Bye. ",0
654,"At the moment I I can seem to think about is how strange it is to think about what I'm thinking about. I'm not really sure if I can truley display my thoughts if that's what I'm concentrating on instead of letting my mind wander subconsiously. I'm not sure if that makes any sense, but it does to me. I'm trying to fight the temptation to go back and reword/correct sentences. Its very strange. I'm also trying not to have more than a two seconds pause between words/sentences so that I can show a true, 20 minute, unbroken stream of thought. I can't , unfortunately, fight the urge to correct typos - its natural for me to press the delete key the oment I see a mistake pop up on the screen. It will be interesting, however, to read this when I'm finished and see how many mistakes I missed. My roomate just put a CD on that I haven't heard in a long time - it makes mee think about highschool (the last time I listened to this)  what is it called?   . Oasis I think  you, and the name of the song is ""Wonderwall""  I sincerely hope that its just a TA reading this and not Dr. Keller because I'll probably be embarrased at my grammar usage/sentence structure, ect. ect. Did you know (I'm sure you do) that ""etcetara"" is Latin for ""and so forth""  I know this because I took Latin in high school. It was a complete waste of time. I only got little useless trivial pieces of infromation out of it. Thought my favorite insult is still ""habitas familia in miser villa"" (you and your family live in a miserable farmhouse)  Our teacher left midway through our senior year and so they had a spanish teacher named Mr. Soto teach the class. Kind of funny because he didn't know Latin, but hey, actually knowing the language is just optional right?  Latins dead anyway. hehe  It just occured to me that this is actually how I type a , drat, phone. k, that was my girlfriend, Liz. we're not having the best of time, though I'm sure (I hope) we'll work it out. I pondered writing during the phone conversation but that would be weird (especially for Liz) because I seriously doubt I can type and talk at the same time. unless I type giberish. or talk giberish; either of which would be bad in their own right. what was I talking, er. tyiping about before?  I actually had to scan up the page to read and remember - it was email. I was thinking about how I actually type a lot of emails like this - not really without thinkg about what I'm saying and not looking for grammar and all that but just typing continously. Usually because I'm emailing like 5 different people and it takes to long and its annoying. speaking of annoying, this is taking a long time  Its amazing how long 20 minutes can go by when you're thinking what else you could be doing. we're going to play risk in about 25 minutes. I love Risk. I'm not sure really, there's just somethin strangely fun about taking over the world. I also play this game on my computer called ""Civilization, Call to Power"" which is wonderfullly complex and very challenging. You build a civilization from 4000bc to 3000ad and either try to beat the computer opponents economically and in number of scientific andvances (kind of on a point system) or attempt to take over the world. In my currect game I have eliminated 3 of the 4 computer oppents and I'm going for the kill on my last enemy, the Persians. I made the mistake of using nuclear weapons and now my populace is very angry at me because of nuclear fallout and all that garbage. How many people have actually tried to take over the world?  3?  Alexander, Napoleon and Hitler. All failed. I wonder if its even possible. Probably not, especially when your enemies have nukes. Nukes are kind of scary, I try not to think about them. Ok, thats 20 minutes FINALLY! ",0
70,"College seems very stressful. It's not like high school where you are playing only to get into college, now, more or less, you are playing for the rest of your life. It seems rather dramatic when you think about it. How can an eighteen year old hold the future in his or her hands. That seems rather demanding. However, the possibility of greatness and success can motivate five- year olds, it seems. Anyway, 40000 people is certainly a lot to contend with. Pressure seems to fill the air everywhere. Not that I mind it at all. I kind of like the atmosphere that engulfs Texas. The attitude of ""wanting to learn "" is beneficial to everyone involved in the higher education process. High School seems like a distant memory now that I'm here. It's extremely hard to imagine that only a few months ago I was a Senior. Man was that fun to say. I enjoyed every second of my senior year, but this year will be so much better. Thinking of the Princess Diana tragedy. . She was a wonderful woman. I think that outside her death, the biggest tragedy to come out of this deal is the fate of her children. I couldn't possibly imagine the stress and trauma of losing my mother. That's seems incomprehensible at my age. I look now to the rest of the school year. It seems so intimidating right now. I don't know how the courses will be and I hope that my work ethic will stand firm. I think that my favorite quote is ""Greatness courts failure""  I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t think there is anything more true in this world than that. I first heard it on Tin Cup. What a great flick. I saw Boyz in the Hood last night for the first time in years. Outside of the young boy giving the Reagan Bush '84 sign the bird, the movie was spectacular. Funny how there were riots in Los Angeles on the night of the movie's premier. That seems odd. The movie is very sympathetic to the myriad of problems in South Central, LA and automatically, there is public outcry. That's like riots in Scotland when Braveheart was released (DidnÃ¯Â¿Â½t happen, but serves as a sarcastic counter point. The best movie of all time maybe Braveheart, but the best movie of last year was Jerry Maguire, hands down. Good love story and date flick. I recommend it to anyone who reads my babble here. Furthermore, it is imperative to realize the implications and the modifications of absolutely nothing. I just like typing implications and modifications. Do do do a da da da. Theme of a funny commercial I saw yesterday, one of the many considering how bored I was. Slothfulness can certainly be enjoyable, though ",1
2466,"I have just gotten off the phone with brady. I'm trying to decide what exacly we will do  this weekend. he wants to go to a hotel, but I know I have to babysit and I'm not sure exactly  how I will tell my dad to pick us up from here. My birthday is this weekend, and it doesn't really  even feel like it. I don't really mind, but I have a feeling Brady probably won't do much for it. I  almost feel like I'm always doing something for him. I should, I really care about him. He says  he will pay for the hotel, but I don't really want that for my birthday. I'ts just not htat important  to me. I feel guilty today for lying to my dad about gettin gout of the TIP program. I know that  sometimes I have to lie about things like that in order for them to understand. I haven't heard  from my mom so I'm not sure if she's mad at me or not. She probably doesn't care, but when  she does find out she will freak. I wish Brady would pay more attention. He tries so hard, but it  doesn't seem like he has the chance to do so. I need to work out. I'm feeling that although I  don't weigh that much my weight is getting out of control. Perhaps I'm overreacting. Kristen  and I went shopping yesterday. I really don't plan on shopping anymore. Yikes. We don't really  need anything anyways. I need a strapless bra though. I'm surprised I didn't get one. oh well. I wish I could figure out what to do on Friday with Brady. I want Kristen to be able to hang out  with us too. He's concerned that I tell her too mucha bout our personal life, but I really don't. Dana kind of pisses me off. Why is everyone so negative about a caring relationship?  She's  probably just jealous, she hasn't been able to keep a guy at all for a long time. I'm concerned  for her because I don't want her to be doing drugs anymore, but she probably is. She has too much  sex too. lol. It's hard to not be concerned with what your friends are doing. Kristen is  surprisingly very understanding to everything that's going on in my life. She's caring and funny  to be around. I wasn't sure what to expect since she's friends with Kristin, Hayley etc. They  apparently aren't waht I expected them to be. They play if off to be all God-like, when in all  realtiy they judge pretty much everyone. I don't think that is right. Although I'm not that  religious, I do care about God and don't think that those kinds of behavior are fair. I'm looking  att he picture of Brady and me. Kris was kind of weird about the whole boyfriend thing. I hope  that brady and I last. I would do anything to spend the rest of my life with him. I care about  him so much, and the distance hurts. I think it isi probably for the best though. I can't imagine  having to go to school with him. His roommates aren't as crazy as I thought, but bad enough. I  jut hope that he doesn't get heavy into drinking,a nd I don't assume he will. Sarah is a bitch, I  can't believe she comes off like taht. ugh, it really bothers me. I wonder what it's like at home  without me there. My mom is making a big deal about me not calling, but in all honesty I just  don't care. I don't know why I'm so unfeeling lately. It's probably because I'm about to start my  period. maybe I'll skip it this month, in fact I probably will. I don't usually have allergies, but for  some reason my eyes keep tearing. It's either my contacts or allergies. I just changed my  contacts though. I really have to pee. The eyes watering is a little embarrassing. Sometimes I  wish I coiuld do more. I kind of wish I woul dhave rushed to be in a sorority. I feel as though I  ahve no friends because I have lost them to brady. Should I go to florida with my parents during  spring break or should I spend time with Brady instead?  Maybe I could make money  babysitting. That would be nice. I hope my parents aren't mad because I want to babysit on  Saturday instead ofdoing my birthday thing. I don't see why it would be that big of a deal, but  apparently it is. I kind of want to go tanning, but it's not good with my current skin situation and  whatnot. that reminds me of richard rush. I wonder how he is doing. Spoiled brat. I'm really  hungry too. I'm not sure what I'm going to eat, but I wish Kristen would get here so taht we can  go eat. That would be really good. lol. I'm hoping that I won't look old when I'm 25 or so. Heck, I don't even know what I want to do with my life. I almost feel as though if I marry Brady  will accomplish everything. I want so badly to be with him forever. NO one understand me like  he does. I wish I had saved myself for him, like he did for me. How is he able to only commit  to me?  I must care about him so much that he feels like he should. I'm glad that I've gotten to  know hhis family a lot better. his mom is honestly really nice to me, and I don't ahve a problem  with her anymore. It would be awesome to be ilke paris hilton. She's has it really good. I  wonder what it would be like if my parents lived more like they should. They are always trying  to save money when in reality being multi-millionaires does not mean that you should only do  that. Perhaps it's a shock from the inheritance or something. I don't know. It's confusing to  me. Ok, this is getting old. I'm a little tired of writing. It's probably because I'm hungry. I'm a little  confused as to what I should study here at school. I've had an interst in psychology, but do I  really want to do that for the rest of my life. I know it doesn't just end here, but I feel as though  there aren't many options when it comes to what I can do with my life. yay, kristen got back and  we can go eat now. My time is almost over. I'm about to pee in my pants too. AHHHHH!!!!! some people try to hard ",0
2375,"     Well, yesterday was a good day, that is until I spoke to my boyfriend on the phone. I guess I was being overly mean to him and we got in a big argument over nothing. I was mad at him and then hung up with him, then I called to apologize and he was mad at me for being mad at him. It was just one big drama over nothing. I guess I made him extra angry because he told me he needed to sleep it off otherwise he might say things he really didn't mean. That ofcourse made me sad, because all I wanted to do was say sorry and just talk to him. He is attending college at Texas State, the big party school, and I guess I'm just scared I'm going to lose him. He's already been doing what that school is known for, boozing it up. Although I haven't been with him for long, the connection we share is the best feeling I've felt in such a long time. It makes me sad because I'm not sure if relationships like mine are meant to last. I've never heard anything good about long distance relationships, and the more I think about it, the more I worry. Maybe that's why I was being rude to him. My fears just come out in other ways. It's so strange though because I know I can see him pretty much every weekend. I'm just so confused right now. Maybe I'm just stressed. It is my first year of college and I'm expreiencing so many new things, including confusing lectures from professors. I just want everything to be okay. I want good grades. I want to have fun. And most of all I want to work things out with my boyfriend. I felt like crying when I got off the phone with him last night, but I held back because I didn't want my room mate to thing anything was wrong. When I think of my boyfriend I can only think of a future with him. I've known him a lot longer than I've actually been with him, and it's not that he's just someone to kiss and hug, he's more of a best friend to me. I know this may not last forever, and that's what makes my heart break. I'm only 18. What are the odds of he and I actually getting married, honestly? Then it makes me think why I even bother getting into relationships if they are just going to end? There really is no point. On the other hand, I need to be with this boy. Life just wouldn't be the same without him. What to do? Maybe I'll just propose to him. haha, yeah right. I just want things to be okay. I just want to be happy, and it seems he's one of the main reasons I am. Grrr, all of this stuff doesn't even make any sense. Anyhow, this writing assignment was really helpful. Got some of my feelings out, and I've never said any of this stuff to anyone. It was like a journal. I'm glad I'm taking such a cool class. ",0
73,"First I am wondering why I am doing this assignment - this seems silly but still my mind is always wandering and therefore this should not be difficult. I hope Camille calls me back this evening. I really think I should be a happy guy as long as she stops talking about her dog. She is silly with her blonde hair I am hungry Jester food is so amusing I wonder if I can eat that food everyday after I graduate the girl sitting next to me is very ""not amusing"" I hope she does not stand up, for she probably wouldn't appreciate what I say about her I wonder if anyone else stares at people they find unattractive she probably thinks I want to take her on a date or something because I keep looking at her, but in reality the only place I would take her is to the zoo and tell her to stay there I don't enjoy typing but I suppose it keeps my fingers from getting fat when I took keyboarding in tenth grade I learned to type fairly fast but the only thing I remember typing in that class was the sentence Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country. who said that Kennedy Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country how exciting I would like to think that includes women as well because they can die too oh no the ugly girl just caught me looking at her I acted like I had a bug in my eye she is talking with the girl next to her, and surprisingly enough she is typing the same silly assignment I am  I really hope she is in the same lecture class as I am because I would like to sit next to her and ask her why her hair smells so bad is it a lack of shampoo or is it a hereditary flaw  either way I remember whey I watched Back to the Future part III when they were in the 1880's I bet everyone smelled back then  Clint Eastwood has been in alot of western movies I really do not like this computer because the more I write the more the screen moves over as if the line is a mile long  I have written for seven minutes already and I have only written seven lines  one line a minute is about as fast as I eat a taco but taco bell has this new hot sauce that they call FIRE how scary I can drink that stuff it is so hot I threw some on our fire in our chimney at home and it put the fire out  the girl working at the counter in the computer lab is not amusing either  Those glasses she is wearing went out of style when Marsha Brady graduated highschool  if she has binoculars she can probably see my screen from her seat so if she kicks me out before twenty minutes I wonder if Mr. Pennebaker would be sympathetic  why are there pictures of whales on the wall maybe to remind most of the girls in here they ought not to eat too much I had a girlfriend named Paige Scott in seventh grade and we called her whale  but I didn't care because she was so nice  That is good  All guys should only care about personality to an extent, anyway  that's why I like Camille. maybe two or three girls have come through my life that I could honestly say I didn't care what anyone else thought about them because I like them anyway. the last to own that title got pregnant last month so I was kind of angry with her. Most girls would probably break up with their boyfriends when they only offer to pay for 1/3 the cost of an abortion and they spend that money on marijuana  I was happy to lend her the money maybe she'll realize she's better off with me anyway because I would have paid for the entire thing and I would have gone through the procedure I God allowed me too  how long has it been now ok five more minutes   what would you like to know?   SUBMIT YOUR PAPER  that sounds silly I would rather crumple it up and throw it at my teacher   Teachers should tell the class more about themselves so may be I would now rather or not it was acceptable behavior to throw my exams at them. Do they like baseball?  I went to look up my friends number at the university of Texas And m but he was not listed. The computer seemed to think he was the head of the alumni or something. Doubt it - he probably won't graduate because he smells too  he and Bevo ought to share a bathroom. he used to have a shaved head and a little horn on top. Which reminds me of the dumbest thing he's ever done when he worked at a video store and stole 12 porno movies. His parents are head of the Christian Mission Church or something and they were kinda mad. he has no scruples he had to pay 180 dollars for those movies and he wanted to watch them at my house. Doubt it I don't steal from video stores and I will not agree to his stealing them either, but I did watch this movies at his house. they were exciting I guess one of the girls names was heather Hooters she was pretty but I doubt she was 100% natural is anyone I know going to read this?  That's ok cause I am happy with who I am   I will tell the whole world I love, well something, I won't mention because if the president of this university knows he will transfer me to a and m. ok I love farming. The sound of the plow chu chu chu through the grass is almost enough to bring me to orgasm. one more minute can you tell I 'm looking at my watch I shouldn't treat this as a paper where I am talking to someone else but rather just with myself but how can I think about anything else when my fingers hurt so much from typing maybe Camille will call but I hope I can hold off on calling her - time to eat - Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country.       Oops I almost hit the clear button. ",0

350,"Last night I was almost done and my computer just shut off. I don't really understand why but oh well. I don't usually understand computer stuff, or any technical stuff in general. I hope that they have my packet today at the co-op so that I can be totally done with mis before tomorrow I think that I am pretty organized in relation to homework more organized than usual at least I think that Lucy will be a good academic influence on me since she is a good studier its so much different having a roommate that studies since angie didn't do much last year but it is a good thing may be finally I will get to go to sleep earlier and that will make me healthy I still can't believe that I didn't catch mono from angie last year I have a sore throat now I hope that it goes away soon I don't really want to have to go to the health center you never know when th3ey are going out have to take blood and that really freaks me out I can't believe that it is already time to start school again this summer went by so fast and rush was such a blur and we have had no time to recuperate before jumping back into school this semester is going out be really hard and busy I think I thin k all of my classes will be really interesting, but difficult I am so glad that I was able to get out of art history and into philosophy that will be a lot more interesting it is so weird how some teachers can teacher art history so differently so many people told me that they liked it and that it was easy but I know that that class wouldn't have been easy it was such a pain to add/drop though I am so glad that it is done next weekend is the first football game I am looking forward to it I am glad that billy and I got season tickets so that I don't have to go draw or anything it s so nice to have all of them now and especially the OU tickets I doubt that I will end up going to the a and m game  because I bet I will stay home for thanksgiving well, billy can invite one of this friends to go with him I can't believe that he wouldn't stay home for thanksgiving though that surprises me his mom is going to be very unhappy with him I am getting really hungry I wonder what we will do for dinner I wish that billy and I could get together but we are not on the best terms right now I can't believe that we got in such a big fight last night maybe we were just tired I hope that everything turns out okay it was nice of eric and Jeff to come over last night sometimes I miss having all those guys next door like last year we had a lot of fun last year together I am glad that Cindy and eric get to be together again, but I hope that they are prepared for what's ahead it will be hard for them to adjust out being together all the time especially when the stress from school really kicks in I am kind of getting a little homesick I am anxious to see Lauren's new car I can't believe that she is really turning sixteen I am really afraid for her to drive so I hope that mom and dad are taking her out a lot for a lot of good driving experience she really could use the practice I am anxious to see dads' new office space too I hope that he is a little less stressed I know that going out the party last night was probably pretty hard for him, but I am glad that Steve a. will be available to help him because he needs some new employees I know that mom is getting worried about him being so stressed all the time but I know that she really is glad that he is not going out Minneapolis a lot that was getting really old it was nice to see Meredith this weekend it is so weird being I'm the same city as her again I wish tat I could have gotten to see brad too, but he was busy my feelings were kind of hurt how he acted toward me at the party on Wednesday night, but I understand they both still seem pretty immature and I am kind of worried about Meredith and I hope that she is careful. I am glad that she found a date for the date dash I can't believe that they are all living on the same hall that is just a little too weird for me but that's pat for you I hope that they all have a fun year and I hope that we all keep in touch it was nice seeing Ashley this weekend too her room at the house is really nice I think that her sorority house is really nice also it is really big and it must be nice to have their own bathroom and not have to do the community thing I am glad that Lucy and I are going to go on a walk I could really use the exercise I am going to try to start aerobics tomorrow I really need too get back in shape I felt so good about myself last year when I was going to aerobics everyday I need to get back in that mode I don't think that I really lost that much weight this summer but things seem to be fitting better now. I seem to not be snacking as much as I did last year which is a very good thing I hope that the food at the sorority house gets better because it hasn't been very good lately but I think that it will get better I hope that billy calls me after he gets home from work he is working way too hard I guess that he won't work next weekend because he will be at the football game that's a good things maybe we can spend some qt together okay this is getting hard of more things to keep talking about I think that I might be repeating some of the same stuff over and over again I hat it that mom can 't really send packages to the apartment but I'm afraid that I would never get them since there is no real apartment address or anything I'm afraid that they would just leave it outside my door and then something might happen whit it I hope that Amy and Meredith had a good time with their boys this weekend I will go down later and see I have a lot of fun with them we are really similar in a lot of ways I am really glad that they are living at centennial too there are so many tridelts here it is a lot of fun I wonder where Lucy and I will walk too we need to somehow walk by the coop I hope that it is not too hot outside when I went out onto the balcony a couple minutes ago it was really hot I think that it will be fun to study out there once it gets a little cooler I am anxious for it to cool down it was so hot walking out class the other day especially to the art building I was so disgusting by the time I got back form class Mondays and Wednesdays are going to be long now that I go from one to five but Tuesdays and Thursdays will be pretty easy except this Tuesday I have that class from six to eight o'clock which really stinks I wonder why all the good shows start again I can't wait to see the friends season premier and 90210 I am so excited this year should be very good well I am going to stop this now it is now over 20 minutes   ",1

2414,"     Ok, I'm thinking about a whole lot of nothing, and unfortunately since I've been told I type rather fast the professor to teacher's aid will now have to suffer through the horrible task of reading through the unintelligable thought processes of Mark's mind. I hope that no one reads this seriously at all. Ok now someone is watching me type, oh they're gone. That was fast, I'm telling you this is a waste of time and I'm not going to reveal anything special during twenty minutes. I'm actually kind of depressed at the fact that twenty minutes of my own un-interrupted thought would yield so little. I miss my wife. Yeah that's right my wife. We aren't legally married but we would like to consider ourselves married and I do. I certainly hope that no one bothers to mock my idea of marriage because I actually do take it very seriously. I love her more than life, more than anything else in this world and if anyone dares to mock that love or try to deny my marriage to her as real they will have to deal with my constant and thorough wrath. Now I'll write about pizza hut. They got this buffet that's only 3. 99, not bad, but the same as cici's so if they're pizza is not far superior than I will be terribly angry at them for advertising such a horrible deal. I know that was kind of in the middle of nowhere and I will admit that something someone else just said nearby me did actually influence that statement. I hope that this world is a peaceful place for my children I will do whatever I can to ensure this. I love my wife so much. I miss her terribly. There seems to be no longer a thought in my mind except how I have many a time disputed the reality of free will. How can one expect to have something called free will then expect to be judged finally. Because if I had full free will I could have chosen not to be exposed to the information that I would be judged for my actions on earth. But since I couldn't choose whether or not I could be exposed to such information. I am a Catholic. This is a stated fact that some might take as foolish words of a foolish person. But the truth is that I consider myself a part of this religion yet I do not completely agree with all of the aspects of the religion. For example the idea that all gay people will go to hell is foolish to me. My idea of who goes to heaven and who goes to hell is this:  Good people go to heaven. Bad people go to hell. Simple right?  Except what I qualify as a good person is different from what other people think is good. So what now?  Is my idea of good right or is theirs. But wait, the plot thickens. I have a solution to such a simple and timeless problem. You see I believe that God instilled in every human being the basic concience in that discerns between bad and good. The most amazing thing about this theory of mine is that if someone does something I find to be unacceptable I can be certain that they also think it is unacceptable. I am almost always right in this aspect. Every time I have seen something I think is wrong I can eventually approach the person about their actions and they will almost always agree with me that what they did is wrong. However, they will also go as far as to explain their good intentions. The hardest part of that aspect of the conversation is that it becomes difficult to discern between who is just self-delusioned and who genuinely had good intentions. I am not proud of all that I've done in my life. The only reason I can adopt a theory of shared thoughts of what is right and what is wrong is because I apply this theory to myself and find it to be true. I once actually cheated on one of my ex-girlfriends. One of the worst days of my life. There is no reason I can use to explain my actions. But I did it to end the relationship. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. Good job huh?  Well she didn't want to leave anyway. At least that was what I thought. I was so damn confused. I cheated on her, a rule I set for myself a long time ago was that I would NEVER cheat on a girlfriend. And I did. I disgraced myself and I hate. Er hated myself for it. I did it to invoke another of my rules for myself. Should an infraction upon the rule about NEVER cheating on my girlfriend I must then break-up with her because she deserves better than that. I don't know if I'm wrong. But I could be. Man you know sometimes music can just totally change one's mood. Now I'm listening to Damien Rice. The little known writer of some of the best music I've ever heard. I think he's great. It's kind of weird I guess for a guy to like some other guy's music so much but I do. I also like this guy Joseph Arthur a lot because both of these artists seem real to me. Their style of singing their lyrics are all so real. I love the way I can relate to it. I recently read ""A streetcar named desire"". The female role of blanche. She is like my ex. She lies, decieves in the name of giving people what they ""want""  NEVER tell me what I want. Only I know that and I don't appreciate being told. If anyone ever makes assumptions about who I am before I meet them. I get reasonably angry but I hide it pretty ok. You. For some reason I have been descrimanated against for being Mexican twice in my life. Both times by a girlfriends family. I have an extraordinarily pale complexion. The funny thing about that is one of them is Mexican. Heh what can I say. ",1
2100,"Okay. This is weird. I don't like assignments like this one. I'm trying to track my own thoughts and feelings; trying to be somewhat original and all I find is nothing really. Seems like deep down I am pretty reserved. Well, actually I know that I am so this is not a surprising. Anyways, there it is . nothing. Rachel just got home. She is my sister. She had swim team practice. I think she has more talent than she is willing to admit she has. Does that make sense? Working hard isn't her most favorite thing, though. I bet you wondering why I am expressing myself so badly. It has to do with the fact that English is not my native language. I am German. My real family is still in Germany. So Rachel is not my real sister. She is part of the family I am staying with. Now I am going blank again. Let's talk about the family I am staying with then. They are very kind. After all, they aren't charging me anything. Why? That's a longer story. I think my host mom would be an interesting case for psychology. There isn't anything wrong with her. It's just an perfect example for insecurity at its highest level. The funny thing is that nobody would ever suspect this insecurity. And I am sure she would vehemently repudiate such a statement. But it's true. From what I understand you can blame that on her childhood. Her version is that her parents wanted a boy as their first child. Well, it was her they got. Accordingly, her parents made that very clear throughout her whole life. Well, you can derive your own implications. Anyways, she is on a constant mission to prove to everybody how smart and special she is. It goes even so far that she fabricates facts in order to win arguments. Even when you present her with indisputable facts she refuses to admit that she was wrong. She goes as far as questioning well known axioms or pundits. Anyway, I should be talking about myself. I have my own problems. I can't state my feelings. That is as far as I will go because I can't talk about it. Then it can't be cured. Irony. Now I am thinking about UT. It's pretty overwhelming. In Germany my High School graduating class had about 70 people. Yup. But I will do fine. I am just having these high expectations in college. I want to find my dead poet society"" - teacher. Someone that will point me in the right direction. That makes learning an adventure. Right now, I still have to force myself to do homework. Time is up!   ",0
1933,"I'm wondering just what the point of this is. this is really boring,       I wish I had something to eat, it's getting close to dinner time, maybe      if I turn on the stereo this won't be so bad. it's really hot in my dorm room, this is still as boring as ever. I don't know how I'm going to     be able to keep this up for twenty minutes. I can't help but stare at the     posters to kill time. I'm particularly fond the print of Monet's sunset at Venice. There are so many things I'd rather be doing right now, like watching TV or sleeping. Well I'd much rather this have been a 5 minute stream of consciousness writing, since 6 minutes has lapsed. I wonder     just how many of these the professor/TA's actually read. I know I wouldn't want to have to read any of these. Hopefully I did well on my biology test I took today. Tomorrow is my birthday and hopefully that will be cool. I still have a lot of reading to do tonight, which I will more than likely put off until sunday. Only ten minutes has gone by so far. this is incredibly boring, but at least it's not all that difficult. I thought last class's discussion was very interesting, however gruesome some of the experiments on the mice seemed. I can hear people talking out side. Normally I would find this disruptive, but now it's welcomed as it helps me think of more to write about. I wish I had a laptop so that I could type this elsewhere, and I think the heat from my computer contributes to my room's excessively high temperature. I wish I could go to the game saturday, but I didn't get a ticket. Last week's game was really exciting. Only one more minute. I just wish this were over with. I can't help but notice how disorganized my desk is, even this early in the school year. I can hear music playing in the next room. I wish my stereo system was that loud. ",0
2129,"Today I felt very happy. This morning at church I felt more comfortable becuase it was more traditional to me. I guess after my youth back at my hometown that's all I like. My stomach hurts a little right now, as much as I eat I don't know why I keep losing weight. Last night was our date with Martha and Zra, it didn't go as planned, at least for me. I don't know what the deal is, but my luck with women is just not the best. Man, those little granola bars are the best, the one I ate with my salad today. I'm thinking about talking to that girl in the cafeteria. She is 22 I think, but then again, age is only a number in college. In college it doesn't feel like I'm classified anymore, it's just that I'm an adult now. Since I've been here, I miss my family, but I haven't gotten homesick. Traffic here is horrible, it's to fast. I want to see that new movie Freddy v. s. Jason. I don't know why but I read that this girl wasn't into scary movies. It's dark outside, I think I'm going to go run after this. Well the Titans v. s. Raiders game is on. I went to Ernie's house yesterday to go watch all the football games that went on for college. Hopefully I don't get challenged for beating Robby and Ernie at NCAA. That referee has an anoying voice. I ate a cookies and cream Ice Cream bar, it was pretty good. My roommate is laying down. I don't know why it seems he doesn't have as much school work as I do. I type pretty fast for a guy. I really need to get that program for my computer with Power point and all. Right now I'm looking at a picture of my family and pet's. I think I have to have the best parent's ever, I mean, if it weren't for them I wouldn't be here right now. I kind of want to here some Ron Isley. This guy said he french kiss a french woman. Kinda funny. This weekend we went to Spiro's, met up with Stephen, couldn't get a wristband. My printer is so slow, it's loud also. My fingers are kind of cramping and I still have 10 minutes left. There is a little running icon on the left of my screen. The sky looks awesome right now, it's like the sun just passed the horizon. I got back in at 5 a. m. last night. I was pretty tired, I ate a pop tart before I went to bed. I don't know why, but I knew I shouldn't have ate but I was hungry. I always think to myself If you just sleep through it, you won't be hungry"" I talked to Brittany today, she is pretty hot. I think she has a boyfriend back in her hometown. Speaking of which, why is everyone going back home? They just got here. I know if I went to Tech I wouldn't be going home all the time. I keep hearing a little bit of words from the TV  and it said "" the crowd is loud "" and ""another flag down "" Stickie note says, Aug 29 FIG meeting. Our FIG supervisor is pretty hot also. She is a sophomore, so maybe I could talk to her too. Next week we play arkansas. I remember one time at Tech during my athletic training for NCA, I thought I was in a tornado. Rosalinda was eating pizza that night. A bright neon light. I hope that this test doesn't say that I think about food to much, I've said something about food like 6 times. I used to be a big guy, 280 lbs. Now I'm down to 210. I feel better, just not sculpted. I'm kinda nervous to go to Greogory gym to go join a rec sport. I'm not sure how it works and I don't have the money to just throw up in the air. Hey, I just looked away from the computer for once. Right now as I type I'm looking at all the wires on the floor. That could start a fire. Nah, the papers are not close enough. That didn't make sense. I have this candle from initiation the other night. I kept it because I like keeping sentimental. I also collect coca cola bottles. I gave up cokes like a year ago. I think this whole year I might of had 10 cokes all together. That's healthy. Especially here, all you can do is sweat here, I hate it. The trash can is fully, I threw it yesterday but I forgot to put a bag in it. I hear someone passing outside. You know, sometimes I drift away from my mind set when I drive. It's like I don't remember how I was driving from point A to point B. It's kind of hard to explain. It usually happens when I have a millions things running through my head. Internet globe. That recycling commercial keeps coming on that bad ass station. 93. 3. Love. My mom loves me, she wants to send me money for my birthday next week. Wow, the big 19. I'm getting old, only 2 more years and all will be good. Something I've waited for in awhile. My grandparent's. God bless their souls. I miss them so much. Love you Grandma and Grandpa!         ",0
767,"There are mostly worries and fear traveling through my mind at the moment. The college stress has really kicked in now that classes have started and much work is to be done. The work is really bothering me in that the level of it is so high. There are many other factors in my stress including being away from home. In the whole 18 years of my life I have never been away from home without my family for this long amount of time. I guess I just miss all the little things about being at home-the comfort, luxery, friends, family, and not to exlude food!  I have eaten Chinese food most of my life and I can say that the dorm food I do not find to satisfying. And the life of college is so different from my previous school experience. UT is so big and so diverse that it's kind of difficult to adjust to. Some people are friendly whiles others may not be. Failure is also a concern for me. I have always done well in school and my parents have high expectations for me to succeed here in college. I miss all my friends and always think about the past and all the good times. I guess I must start all over here and make new friends and continue all the good times. After all, college is supposes to be the best time of one's life. I also think about what I will end up after college-where I'll work and who I will hang out with and if I will graduate here in Austin. My past two weeks here in Austin have been decent. I have been doing many different things like shooting pool or just hanging out with friends or going clubbin in 6th ST. Also I have been busy I might add. The people I have met are very similar to me personality wise. And most of them are from my home town of Houston. I have noticed that there are many different groups of poeple here. I guess the homework load is as much as I expected before I started coollege but there are so many activites to attend to that I find it hard to complete all the work. That is when stress kicks in again and I end up just trying to rush through it. The class sizes are amazing larger than I expected them to be although I knew that UT is the largest school int he nation population wise. I fear that I will not perform as well in school due to all the distractions that goes on like friends wanting to go out and the many places to go to like 6th ST for example. I guess I will adjust to this environment eventually but when I will I am not sure. Rest has also been an issue in my mind as I have trouble sleeping at night when I have early classes the next morning. I am very tired the next day having to walk so much during each school day. But the next night I will find it hard to sleep again. I hope that ends very soon also. ",0
611,"First of all, I guess would be my nervousness about school. There are several things that tie into that. I don't have a group of friends here yet that I can trust and I'm always nervous around strangers. The guy I really like asked me out, but then acts as if he's not interested. I miss home. I miss the ""power"" of being the big dogs at school. I know that thousands of people have felt the same way, and thousand more will feel this is the future, but it's so different when it's really me. I guess I never thought I would be the one in college. Another thing is that I'm the only person to come here from my high school in three years, so all the friends I have here now are ones I met here. One thing I do like about living here is that I have a opportunity to be my own person. I don't like being judged, and here there isn't anything on which someone could base a judgement. I also like not having to tell Mom where I am going, and stuff like that. I'M INDEPENDENT!!! I have the rest of my life to be alone. Right now I have no idea what I want to be or what my divit is. There are a lot of occupations I would like to try but most of all I want to make a difference. A BIG difference. I'd like to try truck-driving, cattle ranching, and I'd like to work at Disneyworld. Most of all I think I want to be happy. I think that's the most important thing you can do for yourself. Way back in the back of my mind are Hook' Em tryouts, and the fact that I try out this next Friday, and I haven't made up a skit for it yet. That's freshman procrastination for you!! Sometimes I feel so overwhelmed of all that UT is and stands for. It's kind of awe-inspiring to think of all the people that have gone here, it's tradition, and it's links to the future. My kinds could be here one day. That's a lot to be on one person's mind, but hey you're the one that asked. ",0
1044,"My feet are killing me. Why am I doing this. My feet sting, I think I'm going to put something on them. Those sandals are horrible. I'm never wearing those again. We have to walk all the way back to class in 30 minutes. This song on my computer kicks ass. I can't wait to go to Elements tonight and pick up some tail. That would be nice. I miss her though. But I wonder if she feels the same way about things right now. I have no idea. I always think about this. I don't know what to do. I love her. I want to go clubbing. I want to get really drunk tonight. I can't cheat on her, but is she saying the same thing. We love each other, I know it. I need to get my mind off of that situation right now. I got to start studying more. She studies all the time. Fuck I did it again. Shift your thoughts to something else. Do it. Okay I need to study when we get back from Psychology class. I got to read Chapter 4 in Economics, and read some Art History. After that I need to call Blake, then get ready and go get drunk. I need to wake up early tomorrow to get a job. God I'm so lazy. I can't believe I slept until one today. This writing what's on my mind stuff is pretty weird, its starting to get kind of boring. I wonder if he's even going to read what's on my mind. Well, it doesn't really matter this paper is pretty stupid. I would get kind off scared if I had to read 540 of these papers. I think I'm going to quit writing this assignment now just cause I don't feel like doing it, and I want to test how long it will take for someone to read this. When whoever who's reading this gets to this point, count how many days it has been since September 15,2000. I would like to know how long it has been so please email me at solomon35@mail. utexas. edu. If you would like I got five more minutes to get back to what I'm thinking right now. Right now I'm thinking that I want to get a drink of water, have a snuff, walk to class, sit next to some hot girl, get her number, and take her out tonight. Wow, I think I just answered my question that I was thinking at the beginning of the page, or did I? I'm tired of writing this, it's just making my girlfriend problem worse. I quit. ",0

2410,"    Sleep! That's what I need to do. I stayed up all night writing my freshman seminar paper on Bond- Born an electric quartet. I asked my roommate that I was going to get some shut eye for about 10 minutes and to wake me up for my class at ten, but she woke me up 40 minutes later. I wasn't late. Thank GOD! I'm really stressed out, I have so many things to do this weekend. Why is college so easy yet so hard to manage. Management, I believe, is the biggest thing in college. I miss my family so much. I really don't know if I'm doing this right. I'm trying to type so fast that my hands are shaking and I'm pressing the wrong keys. Grrr! My roommate is leaving today to see her family. Good for her. We were both crying, actually I was the only one come to think of it. She said she never cries even if it is the saddest thing ever. How can you not cry. I guess I'm very emotional and sensitive. I was sick last weekend and when my parents came up to see me they were really worried. I hope they are healthy and son't worry so much. I want to see them and my brothers so bad. I'm done with classes and I'm free!! I love the feeling of writing in streams of consciousness. It is probably one of my favorite past times besides playing and composing music. I really want to be super good on my electric violin. After writing my paper about the electric quartet, I realized that I wanted to be like them. I actually miss my quartet. They all went to the University of Chicago and are sophomores there. I'm always the youngest in everything. youngest in my graduating class, among my friens, at my church-- that is youth bible group, and even among the freshmans here at UT. I feel so old yet so young compared to others here. I can't believe that there are 30 maybe even 40 year olds in my calculus class. I was so shocked when several older males came and sat in our lecture. They are older than my professor and TA's. What are they doing here at such a old age, I wonder. Did they flunk, not graduate, drop out and then realize many years later that school is the best place to be! I was walking out of PCL after studying late and this homeless guy walks up and asked for money. I ignored him because I was creeped out. It is my belief that if a homeless is not missing any limbs and is perfectly capable to work then he/she should. However, if they are missing an arm or let's say play the saxophone on the street, I would definetly give them some change. I feel that they are doing their best with the disabilities facing them. Last night, my roommate came in with her best guy friend, who's bi-sexual, and another guy that I later found was gay. I really don't mind gay guys although I find it sad, I DO MIND if they are lesbians!! YUCK! I'm a strong christian girl so it really is hard for me to cope with such things. I am very conservative and tend to not change my views for anyone unless the provide convincing evidence. I really want to keep writing on and on but I have 2 minutes left. I love to write especially poems. I like being creative and connecting with my inner feelings. I guess it is because I play classical music and only listen to classical music. Classical music, I think is the most sensuous, expressive and beautiful form of art every created. I would love to whip out my violin or go to a grand piano and play songs after songs. I better wrap up--oh no--it's almost time for me to go. I'll---phew--the computer is letting me write a little more. Whoever is grading this is really going to enjoy reading everyone's writing. Well, I got to head off to my Biology study group. Toodles! ",1
1992,"This is a hard assignment in the sense that I do not know what I am thinking. I have so much homework to do today. I really wish that I had more time to do everything I need to do before a new week starts. I cannot believe that it is already September. I am so ready for another three day weekend. I wish we had another break before Thanksgiving holiday. It is such a pretty day outside. I really should have exercised. I wonder if I will have time tomorrow. Oh well. I really need to go grocery shopping. I have nothing to eat in the apartment. I should ask Kristen if she wants to go to the store with me. Something else I need to do is call Grace about my trip to visit her this October. I really hope that the trip works out. I miss her. She is the funniest girl ever. I really want Mexican food for dinner, but I am having Italian. Oh well, Italian could also be good. At least I won't eat a thousand chips before I even get my meal. Instead I will eat about a pound of bread. Does that even make sense? A pound of bread? Oh I guess I mean a loaf of bread. Whatever. It is so quiet in this room right now. I wish there was something going on so that I could have something funny to think and therefore type about. This stream a consciousness essay must be really boring for someone to read. Actually I bet some of them are really interesting to read. I always am wondering what other people are thinking about. I wish that I was a better typer. I am a little faster than I use to be, but I still make a ton of mistakes. This essay could get pretty long considering the amount of thoughts I have in a twenty minute period. Oh I guess that I am not the only person home right now. I heard a door close it must be Kristen or Catherine. I love living in an apartment. It is so different that last year. I never made my bed. I should get in the habit of making my bed when I get out of bed each day. But then I know I would want to take a nap that day, and then I would just mess up the covers again. Beds are meant to be unmade. I guess that is how I feel now, but wait until I have a family of my own. I totally will be just like my mom and make my kids make their bed every day. I wish that I was as organized as my mom. She always has everything in the right place. I guess I will grow into being more organized one of theses days. I guess? Wow the time really has gone faster than I expected for this essay. but now that I noticed the time I bet it goes even slower. I hate the feeling when you are in class and you think it is at least half over and it really has only been about 15 minutes. That happened to me in math Friday. I think because it was my last class on Friday, I was just anxious for the weekend. I love the weekends. I wish I could have gotten more sleep this weekend. I feel like I never get enough sleep. I in the the mood just to curl up in bed and watch a good movie. I wonder what movie? I really am in the mood for a really good movie that I have not seen or that I love. I have not been to the movie theater in so long. I think the last movie that I saw was Pirates of the Caribbean. It was good. Jonny Depp looked really crazy in the movie. Orlando Bloom is so cute. I wonder how old he is. I bet he is in his early twenties. Just the perfect age for me. I like the idea of the guy being a little older than the girl just because of maturity. I really wish that I had a crush on someone right now. I feel like there is no one I want to date right now. That is the worse feeling. What time is it. It is getting late. The day has gone by so fast. I need to do so many more things today. I should probably start taking my notes for Geography today so that I don't have so much to do tomorrow. I am so sick of taking notes right now though. I really need to stay motivated!  ",1

IÃ¯Â¿Â½m just sitting in front of a  computer in the pcl and typing along. even though the paper doesn't not need correct spelling and stuff, I still go back and correct it(I guess cause it's a  habit). right now IÃ¯Â¿Â½m observing people as they walk by. I really enjoy this  assignment, because it helps me to put all my thoughts and feelings on paper,  instead of holding them in ( as what I normally do)  I generally don't like to  tell people my feelings inside, I guess cause IÃ¯Â¿Â½m very paranoid and I don't  trust others with my personal secrets, even if they were really close friends  of mine. I can't wait until later(6:00p. m. when I go practice my throwing of  footballs. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m really excited about intramural football. most of the people  on my team are really nice. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m just a little scared about the real games b/c  IÃ¯Â¿Â½m afraid that the guys on the other coed IÃ¯Â¿Â½m teams will run into me and hurt  me. I was really sore this morning, after I woke up b/c of football practice  yesterday morning. football practice was pretty fun. I enjoy going through  all the drills and practices. at first I wasn't too sure about playing IÃ¯Â¿Â½m  football, but when one of my friends asked me to join her team I was like sure. our team makeup is kinda funny. we have all upperclassmen guys and mainly freshman girls. I just thought that was kinda interesting. well, IÃ¯Â¿Â½m looking  at the clock and it seems like I have five more minutes of writing time. right after I do this assignment, IÃ¯Â¿Â½m going to go study on the fourth floor. I really don't want to be left behind in my classes. I already am and that's  not a good way to start off my college years. in high school I studied  constantly and now I rarely get to study b/c there is so much stuff going on  and I usually give in to my friends when they want to go do something. I  think time really does fly by. before I know it, it's time to go to sleep again I wish I had nothing to worry about. I always wondered what my life would be like  if I was rich. it would be much more relaxing I think. well, it's already been  twenty minutes and I would write longer, but I really have got to go studying. I can't wait until I get to write paper 2, because I have a lot to say about my  college experience so far. ",0
2035,"I am sitting in the library. I wonder if my typing will bother anybody. Wow, my typing speed isn't very good, especially on this non-ergonomic keyboard. I really hope that no one will examine my spelling and grammar on this assignment. If they did I would look pretty dumb. I don't seem to think in complex sentences, or at least I don't when I am in a stream of consciousness. o wait, there was one. I found some humor in that. when I run I try to run for 20 minutes just like the amount of time I am typing for. time goes by slowly when you run and type. did you ever have a sister? Did you? something about sitting hear and dialoging with myself makes me think of the sound and the fury. maybe I am just trying to be pretentious by making it appear as though I think with a great deal of profundity. good word matt. hopefully I spelled it right and used it correctly. some one is talking in the library. that is not kosher. Sarah use to always say that. I miss her sometimes. Maybe not romantically, but she was fun to be around. I wonder where my romantic life will take me in the next few weeks. So far I have met a lot of girls, but none have blown me away. hopefully there is one out there that will. my mother is dead. she really is. I think about that a lot. I think about that and Emily an awful lot. they both sorta dominate my inner dialogue. I have gotten better about it lately. I am growing, healing, and finding other things to put in my life to replace the thoughts of them, well mostly replace the thoughts of emily. I don't want to forget my mother. I can't forget my mother, or else my life will get fucked up. I must learn from her mistakes and understand that I will naturally view love from a female perspective like I had love from her. I have to be careful. Should I really be this honest right now? should I not censor myself. Really, what business of yours to be in my head right now? you can make me do homework, but can you really make me tell you all the crazy stuff going on in my head? not that I am psycho, but there's a lot going on in my mind all the time and I don't feel like anyone really gets a glimpse of that, much less some random professor with whom I have never had a real conversation. ten more minutes left. what more do you want. I am tired. I would say I am stressed out but that bath I took in the dark a couple of hours ago really relaxed me. My mother taught me that it is very healthy to have positive ways to relieve stress like baths or sodas as opposed to anything else. Its much better to chill than to just blow up at someone. So how exactly can you grade this? Should I make my comments more profound. Should I release some of the beautiful poetry of my mind on this computer screen. Who am I kidding. man, that guy looked pissed. People are so damn easy to read some time. learning how to be a good poker player may be the single greatest skill one can garner from any form of competition. I mean, you always are sizing people up, separating the wheat from the chafe, taking smart calculated risks. its beautiful. I am starting to get really sleepy staring at this screen. I am very sleep deprived. I am VERY sleep deprived, and I don't know when the hell I am going to catch up any time soon either. Being a pledge is kinda rough. very time consuming. man, this last weekend I got no sleep. friday saturday and sunday I was busy as hell. I didn't really even have time for psy 317. my eye itches. I scratched it. five more minutes. I think I am starting to feel a slight headache coming on. this is awhile to stare blankly at a computer screen. I need to relax. ok now I am typing with my eyes closed. wow I actually typed that ok. my typing is not that bad. wow having my eyes closed is nice. really very relaxing, much like that bath I took. I love the dark, especially when I have a headache. now I am starting to chill out again. pretesting looks like it might be lame if I have to stare at a comp for so long. what is that girl looking at. I don't know what to make of a library. I know what to make of a bedroom or a nursing home. they both have really clear feelings that radiate from them. not really this place. is concentration a feeling? cause if it was that would be the color of this place. another poetic comment by yours truly. just call me thoreau or elliot I suppose. Call me ishmael even. I should read more. its fun, it sticks with me, I just don't have time for it often ",0
1786,"     As of this moment, I am thinking about my boyfriend and if he truly loves me like he says. I don't think it's possible for him to love me when he gets so angry, but oh well. I notice my textbooks which are collecting dust and have these bright stickers on them. I am also noticing a blinking at the bottom of my computer, which is an instant message from my boyfriend. I wonder what he has to say. I have this funny taste in my mouth after eating Taco Bell food. It isn't too pleasant. My refrigerator is making lots of noise. I think it's broken. Maybe I should get it fixed. No, I'm too lazy. I'm thinking about my boyfriend again. I think he'd make a good couple with his best friend, but I don't know why I am thinking that because I love him or atleast I think I do. How do I know when I'm in love?  I ask myself this question everyday. I don't think I should be because if I was in love I would know. Love is very confusing. My boyfriend makes me really angry sometimes. I haven't had this bad of a temper ever. I think some of his temper rubbed off on me. The refrigerator is making so much noise still. I feel nauseous. I want to join a sorority, but I am not sure which one to join because I have heard bad things about the ones I am interested in. I also want to join a service one, but at the same time I want to join a social one. I think I'm just going to join this service one I heard about today and maybe join the social one next semester or next year. I miss Taco Bell. I used to work there with my best friend. I wish we were still good friends, but now she's weird. Sometimes I feel like she's only friends with me, so she can use me. She tends to do that. I'm worried about her though because she's madly in love, but I don't think the guy she's in love with loves her back. Well I know for a fact that he treats her bad, but then my boyfriend treats me bad. The refrigerator stopped making noise. Yay!  I'm paranoid about me not being able to spell refrigerator properly. I'm confused about the directions. Are we supposed to write until the 20 minutes are over or when we finish?  That is what I ask myself. I'm really sleepy. My eyes feel like they have big, black bags underneath them. I haven't gotten much sleep in a while. People keep staying in my dorm room and I can't kick them out because my roommate, my cousin, wants to chill with them. Sometimes I wish I could just tell people how I feel straight up but that never happens. I think it's because of my relationship with my ex-best friend. She used to get mad just because I told her the truth, so I feel like I'm scarred for life and can't ever speak my mind. Well this assignment was good. I got to speak my mind and release some stress.

1640,"     WEll college is something i was definetly not prepared for. In high school we got by, by showing up and doing work every now and then inorder to pass the class, but now that i am attending the University of Texas, I go to class because i payed for it and because i want a future. So far in the during these 2-3 weeks of school i have been trying to keep up with the readings, one way is by perchasing the books, which by the way have been giving me back problems. Which leaves me to consider that perhaps I should buy one of those rolling back packs. The readings so far have been tough to keep up with, because so far i have found that if it isn't interesting i will intend to forget what i just read, unintentionally of course. Although some chapters, here and there, in this class and that class, have been rather interesting.           I really hate the food i must eat while i am on campus. Always relying on fast food is disgusting. A person could only take hamburgers, french fries, chicken nuggets, tacos, and even sandwiches for so long. Which is why i am so thankfull that i don't live in a dorm. I have no idea what i would do if i had to eat out everyday. Because not only is it not healthy, but so far eatting on campus is burning a hole in my pocket, not to mention the books that are costly and the longhorn souveniers i can't help to buy. The peole i have met so far all live in dorms around the campus, which also makes me feel left out. All they talk about is parties they have gone to and will go to together now that they know someone else on campus that lives in the same dorm as them.        My classes are a bit overwhelming as much as the readng is concerned, but trying to make sure i pass my classes is what worries me the most. I believe i can do though. I have not been able to sleep sonstantly though. I wake- up at 6:30 am inorder to get ready and to take my sister to school. She, for some reason won't consider taking the bus, so once i drop her off around 7:20 am i am off to UT. Once i arrive on campus the time is 8 am, and i meet a friend for breakfast. Our first class doesn't begin until 10 am but the hastle of finding parking escalates as the morning goes on. By the time i leave the time is my class is over the time is 5pm and i get home at 6 pm, and this is where i find myself so exhausted that all i want to do is sleep. But i realize i must read a chapter for Rhetoric or one of my other classes that i stay up until 12am, and once again i only get about 6 hours of sleep. This system is not working for me, feeling drained of energy, having back pains and wanting to sleep all the time does not sound like what people lead me to believe what college was all about. I see movies and tv sitcoms, about the joys of college, how it is the best time of a persons life. Makeing new friends, going to parties, and going through new experiences, but so far as a freshman i have hardly had any time to dao any of the above. Actually all i have done so far is meet people in classes, which i tend to lose by the next class day, since the classes i have are so large. I don't even have time for old friends, but i know they hardly have time for me either, because of jobs and school. This makes me happy that i don't have a boyfriend as well, because when i did all my time seemed to go to spending it with him, and a realtionship is what i have no time for.            ",0
817,"I really can not wait until this weekend. UT is playing Rice in football and I have some friends who play for Rice. I have not seen these friends since this summer. I have only seen them on t. v. when they got killed my Michigan last week. I hope that they play better this week. I feel bad saying it, but I kind of hope Rice wins. I know it sounds terrible, but they are my friens & one of the players is my ex-boyfriend, but we are still good friends. I am most excited about seeing him. I talk to him on the phone occasinaly, but I have not seen him in person since July. We lived about 45 minutes away from each other and that made it kind of hard to see each other - that is why we broke up. The way we met was pretty cool. Every year my home town (Conroe) has a BBQ Cook Off. Let me tell you it is so much fun - I look forward to it each year. My dad has had a team in the cook off ever since I can remember. Anyway, before the cook off last March a lot of my friends went over to my friends apartment. One of my friends who plays football for Rice was coming down and he was bringing a lot of his friends with him. They all showed up at the apartment and we left for the cook off. My friends and I thought this one guy was so cute & he ended up driving my best friend and me to the cook off. I talked to him some that night, but then he and his friends all went back to Houston. Months went by and I graduated high school and for my senior trip we went to Cancun. We had been there for a few days and one of my friends on the trip with me told me that he had just ran into ""the cute guy from the cook off"" down stairs. I couldn't believe it. He just happened to be in Cancun at the same time as me & he was staying in the same hotel. We all ended up meeting and going out together & we had so much fun. Ever since then we have talked and become really good friends. I guess that is why I am so excited about this weekend. ",0
1487,"It is 4:59 and I have some time to kill while waiting to beat rush hour traffic back to my apartment. I can't help but think it would be sad, for some reason, if all that I am going to write here is going to be lost in a sea of other streams of consciousness, that I will only be graded for the fact that I did it and not examined for the content of my mind. Does everyone hold their mind as sacred? I can't help but instinctively correct my misspellings, so in this way I guess I am somewhat obsessive/compulsive. It's quite liberating to intentionally let it go for a few minutes. This openended assignment, pouring out my mind onto a computer screen page and what do I have to say? This 20 minutes is oddly precious to me because there is that slim, slim chance that someone will read it and be curious or something anything to analyze me take interest show me who I am sometimes I think that's what life is about  everyone trying to be seen, heard, thought of, appreciated, hated, loved, whatever allows them to express the energy, the thoughts, the storm inside. this is horrible writing and yet I wish I had had many assignments like this in the past, free writing, free from restrictions and completely for the purpose of interpreting my thought structure. Who doesn't want to be analyzed? Who doesn't want to analyze? I know that I am biased and can only assume that there are others with the opposite desires of mine, ones who seek to hide and let others speak, be seen, be criticized, revered just watchers, ""voyeurs"". I had a conversation with a couple of friends in a pool one night in which we were talking about our fringe sexuality, what we preferred to do, which roles we like to take. My friends considered themselves ""voyeurs"" and I had to admit that I am more of an exhibitionist, watch me watch me dance, hear me speak, smell me, form your own opinions I only seek to give you something to focus your attention on if that's cool with you. It strikes me as funny that I am speaking to you in the first person, as if this is going to be read, and if it is does it strike you as funny that I am talking to you to the extent that I can, rather than just writing and perhaps addressing things more formally or in the abstract, using different pronouns? I was thinking in class today, oh. some of these people are not used to thinking or being taught to think in a rational objective and scientific manner. I thought again about how different I feel from the freshman now, how my perspective has changedooh ten minutes is up and I feel like I've written a lot. If I were a TA I would sort through these, being very curious and interested in the beginning, and towards the end as I read more and more streams of consciousness my interest would wane and I would look for the shorter ones to read, just to lighten my burden of grading them. But perhaps you have already taken this into consideration and are ""true to science"" YAY! making sure that you choose these completely randomly. I am constantly thinking of people in terms of astrology because it has been a hobby of mine, it supplies me with a wealth of descriptions for different aspects of personality, interaction and life and yet I cannot defend it as scientific, but is something that is unscientific still useful? It has certainly given people (I've talked to) different slants on their problems and concerns, it seems that there is all kinds of analysis that though unscientific can be incidentally helpful to people. I don't discount science, I do believe in the value of scientific testing to a certain extent, as long as we don't lose the other helpful methods in the process. It's a tough tough thing. Of course 99% of everything you are going to see is either subjective entirely or subjective under the pretense of being (somewhat or completely) scientific, which is dangerous I can imagine. But as long as one admits the subjectivity and conditions of what they propose, isn't that honest enough to move on and get something out of it? I have been asking a lot of questions! How defining of me! Now I (as usual) will consciously battle myself over questioning. I will try to stick to statements and feel very stupid for doing so, give into questioning perhaps, and then sooner or later, 3 minutes actually the time will be up. Well love and life and craziness and all the things I thought I would end up saying are not surfacing here, although I think of all of them regularly death, sex, friends, jobs, spirituality, drugs, sex ha ha ha. life life life. why is it that somehow writing gets blocked in the middle of an easy flow? I think I remember once reading about oh shit I lost my train of thought oh yeah, I think it might have been Carl Jung (one of my favorites) talking about how people's hesitation in experimental games like word association indicates an issue awakened at the hearing of a word. Those few seconds that you pause when someone says ""mother"" or something, those tell your therapist everything ha HA! Uhoh time's up. This has been vaguely spellchecked, just enough so you can understand which words I was using. Thank you very much. ",0
51,"IÃ¯Â¿Â½m in the mood to write and so I decided to do this writing assignment. sometimes I get in this mood to write anything and everything thatÃ¯Â¿Â½s on my mind. I guess it only happens when IÃ¯Â¿Â½m bothered by something. time and time again thought it always seems to be about people and my interactions with them and how they are so I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t know. how should I describe. I guess I was too sheltered to know how much people can hurt someone. why are people so selfish and care so much about their own well-being?  why does it hurt the good guy to be good. it seems the nicer you are, the more naive and innocent. the more you get hurt. youÃ¯Â¿Â½d think id get the hang of it by now. but I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t want to become like them. whoeverÃ¯Â¿Â½s reading this. are you Christian?  I am. or I believe in God and His Son Jesus Christ and I try to follow his ways. but it hurts so much because to win is to lose and yet I know IÃ¯Â¿Â½m doing something wrong because in psalms its says to be as harmless as doves and wise as serpents. I think I've got the harmless as doves thing down, but IÃ¯Â¿Â½m not very wise. I always get so hurt. I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t know what to say. my thoughts donÃ¯Â¿Â½t seem to be flowing and I cant seem to get what's on my mind out on this screen. I wish everyone were. how come I cant think. but IÃ¯Â¿Â½m supposed to write for 20 minutes so I guess ill continue. no, IÃ¯Â¿Â½m not totally disappointed with all people or anything if thatÃ¯Â¿Â½s what it sounds like. in fact I love my first roommate. she was so good so unselfish. so caring and hardworking. then there's my second roommate. I gave so much to her. honestly. and literally. she never once cooked for me yet I always for her. she never once cleaned yet I never complained. I bought the groceries and cooked and she ate. I cared for her well being. I never said anything to hurt her. I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t even know how to describe. I really did care about her well being. as roommates, I thought of her as my sister in caring about her. and I tried to show her gods love. her mom came to visit for a month. I gave up my bed and moved into the living room  since we had a one bedroom. living with anyoneÃ¯Â¿Â½s mother, anyone else would complain. the whole month she was there. I still cleaned. but she did cook. although I didnÃ¯Â¿Â½t eat at home that much. I tried to go home late and leave early because it wasnÃ¯Â¿Â½t very comfortable with someone elseÃ¯Â¿Â½s mom at home. I tried my best. and I really thought my old roommate appreciated it. then the day before they moved out I noticed I was missing some silverware and a pair of shoes and since the mom was packing, I presumed she must have misplaced. so I left a note before I left for school to check for me - that IÃ¯Â¿Â½m not sure how many silverware because I lost some in moving before and so its not too many IÃ¯Â¿Â½m sure, but a few. when I came home that evening. there were my pair of shoes and a few silverware she took out all her silverware and started to make me look at every single thing saying, ""look! this is ours,""  then another wrapped piece,  saying ""look,""  and more and more. I was so shocked. I told her I didnÃ¯Â¿Â½t mean to accuse her of stealing, if thatÃ¯Â¿Â½s what she had mistaken it, but  she said no, thatÃ¯Â¿Â½s not it  well its been over 20 minutes now. and in the end she ended up misplacing more of my stuff and I wasnÃ¯Â¿Â½t going to bother asking about them. but it hurt me. not that she took the stuff, but to come out like that. after living together. I have a third roommate now (thank goodness the 2nd was only for the summer)and I hope everything goes well. I wrote about this because I saw my 2nd roommate today. and though we never fought I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t think were friends anymore. and every time I think of her,  IÃ¯Â¿Â½m hurt. ",1
1842,"I don't know what I'm doing tonight. There's a Cory Morrow concert at the Midnight Rodeo place on Ben White. I have no idea how I would get there. Maybe I could get my ex-girlfriend to take me, but that'd be pretty weird. I was just looking online and saw that some OU/UT tickets are going for like $2000. I don't know what people were thinking when they didn't get reserved season football tickets. I just had to go up to the line once and got all my tickets for the entire season, including the OU/UT game. Pretty cool. Ya, Mike's getting upset at me cause I'm not going to College Station this weekend. Instead, I'm going to go see Jerry Jeff Walker in Gruene on Saturday. God, I hate this Nashville country thing. I got to change the radio station. It's upsetting. I wonder where my roomate Houston is. He was supposed to be back around 4:30 and he still hasn't showed up. Oh well. I got all of my calculus homework except for like 2 problems done, so that's pretty cool. I wish he would clean his side of the room a little more. I want to go play soccer tonight at Clark Field, but they're like watching American Pie 2 tonight. That's really cool. Oh well. Haha, it's only been four minutes? This is going to take forever. I can't wait to go back to St. Joe for homecoming. I want to go to the alumni party before the game. Supposedly, it's pretty fun. They don't really mind at all if you're underage. Haha. My leg is hurting because I'm pressing it up against the table while i write. What other homework do I have to do tonight? Hm. . . Oh, I have to print out some Spanish worksheets. My computer keeps humming at odd intervals. I wonder what's going on there. I can't find a decent radio station that I can recieve in my dorm. I'm going to put some music from Kazaa on. Haha, just kidding. Travis Tritt- It's a Great Day to be Alive just came on. Haha. I hope ya'll don't really care about grammar and all that because I'm just trying to write quickly without caring about that kind of stuff. This song reminds me of Garner State Park. That was a blast. They have these dances every night and most people at the park go there. It's awesome. My buddies and I met all these cute girls from Baytown, or something like that. All I know is that I want to go to Baytown sometime! haha. My bed isn't too comfy. It could be a lot nicer. I need to fix that somehow. Great, this song is ending. I wonder what's next. Haha, a little Kazaa is next. You ever listened to   Me and Billy the Kid   by Pat Green? Let me tell ya, it's a good song. I wish I could play the fiddle that well. I need to sign up for a music course next semester on how to play the fiddle . That'd be cool. I suck at it now, but being good at it wouldn't be bad. haha. Only halfway done. I wonder how much people write in these things. I bet reading them is pretty darn interesting. Haha i held back with the   darn   right there. haha. Anyways, I don't want to do calculus. The fiddle sounds really cool in this song. Here's the solo. IT soudns awesome. Seriously, download the song and listen to the solo. You'll like it. . . if you're a Texan. . haha. I hate Antonian high school. My buddy sent me a link to a webpage of theirs, and they were all proud of having made it to the state semis in baseball. Funny thing is, they lost in the first round of playoffs. We had the same records last year (need to change song again) but they went to playoffs because they had a better head to head record. We lost to them both times in the bottom of the last inning. You have no idea how upset we were. A freaking junior dropped a fly ball in the outfield to give them the tying run. I'm still pissed about that, but oh well. This song is awesome. Southbound 35 by Pat Green. It talks about coming back to Texas when he's leaving in Kansas. It's pretty cool. So what else. . I don't know how I'm getting to the OU game. I got to find a ride, maybe with Amy. Homework is no fun. Haha. I love it when they mention Austin in songs. It's pretty cool. I have to clean my room. I need to call whats that place. Midnight Rodeo and ask about the cover and when Cory goes on stage. Hope it's not much. College is quite expensive man. I love this part. Ya. . we were. soutbound 35!. . haha. New song coming. . I feel like a little Palo Alto, Naked Sorority Girls. The lyrics in that one are pretty funny. A Sigma Chi guy showed me this song during Rush Week. They're too expenisve. I think Delta Sig is the way to go. They're cool. This song has an awesome beat. Haha almost done. This actually went by pretty fast. What to do after? Maybe find someone who knows how to do those calculus problems. But when it comes to love, its all Greek to me! haha. . . I love this song. Well this has been fun. Adios till next time. ",1

2385,"     So I think this is a very cool assignment for the students to complete. It gives a very good look at what we are thinking in our heads. I probably don't realize some of the things that I think. maybe after looking at this I will be suprised or shocked or some other feeling. I smell food. I just ate but food smells so good that it makes me want more. I have this weezer song in my head. I don't like weezer yet this song gets stuck in my head. I hope it gets out fast because it is annoying. my neck feels like it is rubber and just wants to fall down, taking my head with it. that would hurt. never have I done so much reading as I have done this past week. it is annoying. I do not enjoy reading much. oh well. I guess I have to do it anyway. my window doesn't get enough light through because it faces our balcony which blocks off some of the light. the apartment is nice. I get my own room and it is very spacious. I hear a ticking sound and it is not a clock. its bugging me and I think its a result of me typing. yep. I stopped and the ticking stopped. I think it is a clock but the clock is rubbing against the wall and isn't on. how ironic maybe. interesting. it stopped. they weezer song was out of my head but it came back for an encore. ill be right back sorry. blanked out for a second. the days seem to go by very fast. the weekends go slow however. I like the weekends. this weekend should be great because I will go hoome for the labor day holiday. seeing my friends from back home alwasy makes me happy. greek mythology has too many  names to remember even a quarter of them. its very a nnoying. how many times have  I said annoying in my train of thought. a good nap would be nice right now. I like that painting of the melting clocks. its very surreal and somehow that makes me feel good. I wanted a poster of it but they were like ten dollars. its just not worth it to me. I am a very economical person when handling money. sometimes its good and bad. a ten dollar poster wasn't a wise choice for me though. cooking. I need to start cooking more things. sure the microwave is awesome but I need to expand my cuisine. iron chef. funny show. iron chef should fight emeril. I wonder who would win. they should put those old batman captions like bam, and wham, and pow on Emerils show when he says those things. it will give it an old school flavor. flavor is good. does water have a flavor. is the flavor water. who cares its good when you're thirsty. I just wish it had like b vitamins like powerade. because water doesn't have like those sugars and stuff. or are the b vitamins coming from the sugars. ill look into it. my mouth is dry. I oculd actually go for some water right now. my neck keeps getting my head closer and closer to the table. I wish I could fly. I just saw some birds flying. I wish I could do that. where would I go. I'd probably go to some tropical climate if my body allowed me too. that would be awesome. today is the first day of the rest of my life. that quote always struck me as very cool sounding. is hould really start using my planner to right down what I need to get done. my memory doesn't serve me quite well. I want some of the energy arizona iced tea. I haven't had any for  quite some time. I'm due for some. but I guess right now all I got is water. that will have to do. potpourri is such a weird word. but smells nice so I guess they are even. I bet it is fun to read other peoples streams of thought. it must be amusing to see all the weird things people come up with without maybe realizing it much. this is one of the best writing assignments I've ever had to write because there is no structure. I am a poor writer. I should practice and get help. I probabloy won't though. ill just get by onw what I can do. it just isn't my thing. donde esta el biblioteca. I need to work on myh Spanish to. hopefully I won't have to take a Spanish class. that would piss me off. I can't stand learning that language or any language for that matter. it would take me too much time. I think tex mex will serve me just fine. bien bien bien. if my phone rings right now its going to scare the hell otta me because I'm so itno righting this. I hope that doesn't happen ",1
289,"Ok so here I am at my computer lab and I am supposed to be typing about what is going on in my head. well nothing really, just waiting for the weekend to come and  what I am going to do . I have no idea on what I am going to do maybe IÃ¯Â¿Â½ll go  out with my roommate or my friends Kristen and tiffany, I don't know. I wish I could see Jason, I miss him so much, but he is coming down the weekend of his  birthday so IÃ¯Â¿Â½ll just wait. am I falling in love, oh well too late, I am already in love but I can't be cause IÃ¯Â¿Â½m here and he is there and I just can't do this to myself. but am I going to find somebody here. I don't want to throw myself on guys but I don't want to be just some face in the crowd. how can you meet people if  you just donÃ¯Â¿Â½t want to talk??  I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t know I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t care I do love Jason and I wish he would get his act together so my mom and dad will like him a lot more and we can have a serious relationship. It's been three years now and I can't stop  going back to him, do I just want the feeling of knowing that I have somebody or  what?  I have been a lot happier since we started talking. I don't know, I'm so  confused. I don't want to turn out like my sisters that married someone that is somewhat worthless and have no money for half of my life. I am better than that. I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t know. am I saying that too much. I am so glad that you are not reading  this because you would think I was a complete psycho. I hate English class, I ] hate to write. It sucks sooooo much. My hands are starting to hurt. I don't  practice Santeria, I ain't got no crystal ball. Well I had a million dollars but I spent it all if I could find that heina and that sancho that she found I pop a  cap in sancho and IÃ¯Â¿Â½d slap her down, well all I really want to know , I cant be and all I really want to say I cant define blah blah blah blah that I s one of my \favorite songs but I cant remember some of the words oh, well   I have a lot more time new song, IÃ¯Â¿Â½m on a one way street with a one night stand with a one track mind out in no man's land, the punishment sometime don't seem to fit the crime , yeah there's a hole in my soul but the one thing IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve learned for every love letter written is  another one burned now you tell me how it's going to be this time is it over, is it over cause I m blowing out the flame, take a walk outside your mind, tell me how it feels to be the one who turns the knife inside of me. ok new stuff letÃ¯Â¿Â½s talk about what I am going to do for JasonÃ¯Â¿Â½s birthday. I will hopefully get some goods from Jennifer and then get a hotel room and we can \smoke out in the hotel room and get really drunk and pass out but before we pass out we have to do some stuff. If I  had access to all the drugs in the world like so well where all I would have to do is have money and call one person, I would be the biggest addict in the world, well not the biggest but pretty close. I love doing drugs, I love getting drunk, I guess IÃ¯Â¿Â½m just curious about this , once I try it I might not like it but I have to at least try first, oh I think my  20 minutes are up in four mor3e minutes do you want to here me sing. Maybe this time  I'll be lucky Maybe this time he'll stay Maybe this time for the first time love will hurry away he will hold me fast IÃ¯Â¿Â½ll be home at last not a loser any more like the last time and the time before every body loves a winner so nobody love me lady peaceful, lady happy that's what I long to be well all the odds are, there in my favor  somethingÃ¯Â¿Â½s bound to begin IT'S GONNNA HAPPEN, HAPPEN SOMETIME, MAYBE THIS TIME I'LL WIN!!!!!!!!

1127,"How should I start this? Writing about my thoughts and feelings is kind of difficult when asked to put them down into words. I mean, I think about things all the time especially when I am walking to class or trying to go to sleep. Right now I am at my friend Desiree's house and I am doing this assignment because I have not done any homework tonight, and I feel like I need to do something before I go to sleep. Desiree is so great! She is my best friend up here in Austin. When I think about how we met(we met in Chicago at a Youth Leadership Forum the summer after our Junior year of High School) and that we both came to U. T. , it astonishes me how fate works. I am a firm believer in fate. My mom always worries about me getting killed in a car accident or getting attacked or something, but I always tell her that a meteor could come through my ceiling at ten o'clock at night and kill me if God wants me dead. There is no stopping fate. But then again, maybe I put too much trust into fate. I always think that things happen for a reason and that if something is meant to be, it will happen. I think that is a good thing to believe. It gives you a positive outlook on life. When something bad happens, I always remind myself that it happened for a reason. This sort of thinking really helps me get over stuff. I bet that everyone who does this assignment ends up talking about love. I think that love and relationships are always on people's minds. I know that I think about it often. Wondering what my future husband is doing right now at this very minute or thinking about some guy that I like. I don't have a boyfriend in Austin right now, but in some ways I'm glad that I don't. I find that when I like a guy I end up thinking about him in class instead of paying attention to the class. That can really get me into trouble. Who knows? I really need to do well this semester. I am shooting for a 4. 0! I think that getting a 4. 0 would be awesome, and I am going to do it! I want to do it at least once before I graduate from college. That is one of my goals. That may sound kind of sad, but I really want to just to show everyone that I am here and I got a 4. 0. Even if it is only once, I want to do it. Well, my twenty minutes is up and I really need to get some sleep so I can work on getting that 4. 0 GPA. It was nice talking to ya whoever you are. ",1
1379,"why in the world do we have to do everything online? I don't have a computer yet PC Mall told me that the one that I wanted would be at least a month because it's backordered. My friend is singing bad German grammar phrases. Megan, Lori, and I just ordered a pizza, and now we're worried that we will get fat. She's still dancing like a complete moron she thinks that she is a hummingbird. I think that I will party hard on Saturday night but not as hard as on last Friday. I got really inebriated and bruised myself in several nondiscreet places. Lori is trying to dictate what I should be writing, but this is my assignment, not hers. Megan smokes crack, and Lori likes to hum really bad show tunes. Lori, please turn the light back on. Melanie just came in wearing an American Outpost shirt. I think that this computer does not like me very much. This Cure song is so wonderful. I'm going to Poly Esther's on Tuesday so that I can shake my groove thing to some quaint 80s tunes. Simple Minds, Jimi Hendrix, Aerosmith, Boston, Culture Club, The GoGos, TheB52sthey're all wonderful! I think that I need to go shopping for some new clothes sometime soon. I should have brought my music down here. Would I wear a black lace skirt with nothing underneath? Probably not, but I wouldn't put it past myself. Megan loves to hump monkeys, and Lori likes to screw donkeys. The pizza man better hurry the hell up I'm starving! This room is really freaking cold (chilly is not cool). The music just got louder, but it's not any better. I don't think that I would look very good in a charcoal gray skirt. Red is definitely my color. My radishes were growing mold, so I threw them out. Old Navy is for high schoolers, Gap is for college kids, and Banana Republic is for the working world. How much longer do I need to type on this damn computer? I would rather write by hand any day. I think my eyes are glazing over from the absurd brightness of the screen. Oohback cramps! My vixen red nail polish is chipping time to redo. random thoughts are running through my head. rings on my fingers but no bells on my toes Megan has a rash on her leg. Big bruise on my thigh. Now I'm just making stuff up. Are my 20 minutes up yet? Guess not. When I start typing randomly, I don't make any sense. Ladybugs everywhere. Ska is fun. Come on Eileen. I'm out of things to talk about now it's all going downhill. ",1
1867,"     I have just finished my first few days of classes at UT Austin. So far they all seem hard and I already have tons of projects, papers, and tests. I have gotten a chance to meet a lot of people. My roommates are all really nice and i enjoy hanging out with them. I also got the chance to join a sorority here. I think that will be a good way for me to meet some new people, expecially since I am from out of state. I can't believe how many people are from Texas here. It is very uncommon for me to run into other out of state students. I am also interested in joining some other organizations on campus. I just don't know how much extra time I will have though. I am interested in playing club tennis, as well as doing some community service. The people who live out here all seem outgoing and friendly. I still miss my family and friends though. I normally don't even get homesick. I think going to a big college has many advantages. There are a lot of new people that you can meet, there are many good clubs, the athletic teams are really good, and much more. However, I think it is going to take me a while to get used to the huge classes. Also, the bookstore, ticket lines, and other things are very crowded. I think I will get used to it though. My major is undeclared. I can't decide what I want to do with myself. I am very interested in medicene, but I don't want to go through all of that school. It seems long and boring, and I don't even like science. I am trying to find jobs that seem fun and interesting, but it is hard to know what you want to do. I know that I don't want to sit in an office all day, and I like communicating with others. I also know that I don't want my life to revolve around my job. It seems like everyone has a major except me.   I met this really nice girl at orientation for UT. We already decided that we want to live together in an apartment next year. I am really excited to get out of the dorms, even though I have only been here for a week!    My best fried is coming out to Austin to visit me in a month. I am really excited. I hope she likes it out here. She goes to University of Southern California, and she loves it.   I think that I have a little cold/flu. My roommate has been sick and had to go to the doctor today to get medicene. My throat started to hurt and I have been coughing. I hope it doesn't get worse!  I normally don't get very sick, so this is kind of weird.   I went down to salt lake with some girls the other night and we had barbeque. It was the first time I have ever had texas barbeque. I didn't really like it, and everyone thought I was wierd because they all love it. I guess I am not used to it yet!  My favorite resteraunt in Austin is PF Changs. I have gone to it 3 times already since I have been here. It is so good. lettuce wraps, spring rolls, chicken, and fortune cookies!  YUM!  My roommate slept through her class today on accident. I hope that never happens to me. I am planning on going to all of my classes so I can keep a good GPA. It is very hard not to get distracted from school work in college though. It is wierd without my parents telling me to do my homework or to clean my room. But my roommate tells me to clean my room because she hates messy things. She is really nice though, so I respect her and keep my room very clean.   I am going to San Antonio soon with one of my friends to see her house. I think it will be really fun. I have never been there. I wish my family were only an hour away sometimes. That would be nice if I get homesick or want a homecooked meal or something. I can't wait to go home for thanksgiving!  I will get to relax and sleep in my own bed!    Well, my time is up, but I am looking forward to a fun year! ",0
1901,"Just like everyone else's writings, I'm sure starting off with I don't know what to write is commonplace. we used to have to write like this in english last year but Mrs. williams would give us a specific topic- like ""king kong"" or ""umbrellas"". she was the coolest teacher, she really had a good time teaching our class and made sure we had a good time too. a lot of the guys took advantage of her good nature though, especially when we had to do the ""hobbitt"" project and austin named one of the characters ""dildo daggins"". that was interesting because Mrs. williams couldn't really hear them say ""dildo"" and wondered why the class was laughing so hard. I wasn't in that class but I got to hear all about it. I really miss all those guys, we had a pretty close group of friends because we all grew up together and went to pretty much all the same schools together. by graduation there were about 7 of us that had gone through school together since pre-k. I think that says a lot about us. there are others that I've gone to school with since elementary school too since we were all in the same advanced classes. this annoying ""firewall alert"" keeps popping up on my screen and it's bugging the fire out of me cause I don't like computers to begin with and I can't get it to stop. kinda like our smoke detector. it beeped for 4 days before someone would come to change it. my roommate went out of town this weekend and when she got back and came in the room she said ""is that thing STILL beeping?"" and she told me it had been beeping for 2 days and she kept forgetting to report it. so I went downstairs to report it and they told me no one would come until at least Monday because the maintenance crew doesn't work on the weekends. it really sucks cause I couldn't study or sleep in here because the thing beeped every 45 seconds. I ended up staying at towers with my guy friends from high school and we had a really good time- so I guess it worked out. I think I'm going to start dating their third roommate- he is from san antonio and I've really gotten to know him the past couple of weeks cause I'm always at my guy friends' place. oh yah- and the maintenance guy finally came today and fixed the smoke detector. I don't know where my roommate is, she left at 5:30 for her sorority meeting and I left for mine at 6 but she is still not back and it's almost 9. my dad called today and wants me to go to my grandparents sometime soon and shut off the hot water heater. my grandparents have been traveling in colorado since the beginning of july and when my parents came to move me in they stayed out at my grandparents (in south austin) and forgot to turn off the hot water heater. I don't understand why he wants me to do it- he could call their neighbors, which would be a lot more convenient (sp?) for me since I don't have a car. I called two of my friends to see if I could borrow their car but neither one of them picked up the phone, so maybe my roommate will take me out there later. I wish I could drive her car but it's a standard and I'm not very good at them. I got my nose re-pierced last night, chasity (my roommate) went with me. I got it done when I was in Ecuador this summer for a dollar and here they wanted $30! I wanted to scream. but oh well- it'll be there for a while. I took it out when I got home from ecuador because I didn't know how my parents would feel about it, and I know my dad's parents would shit bricks if they saw it, so I decided to play it cool and take it out when I was around my parents or grandparents, but it became too much of a hassle and I left it out too long. I really like it though- the stud it a tiny light blue rhinestone. I have a white one I got while I was in ecuador that I'm going to change out pretty soon. my roommate has her nose pierced too. I can't wait to show my brother. I called him last night to tell him and he was kinda mad that I did it without him because I had told him that I'd get it done before I left for college and that he could go with me but it just never happened. it's a big thing in Chile from girls to have their nose pierced and while we were in Ecuador a youth group of about 20 came up from Chile. I really miss Ecuador- I can't wait to go back, even though I don't speak the language very well I made a lot of great relationships. this one guy, dandle, from Chile, really had an impact on me. we still talk through e-mail daily and it's awesome to see things from his perspective. he is the person I'd most like to see again. he taught himself to speak English- he is never had a formal English lesson, and he wants to be a youth minister or music minister. I'm so impressed by his faith and his determination to educate himself. I really wish I had that mindset and determination to better myself without the help of teachers and tutors and school- but there are so many opportunities here that make it easier to get help I suppose. the time's almost up- I really didn't think I'd be able to type and think for 20 minutes but it's kinda flown by in a hurry- bye!

1361,"I am pretty proud of myself today, for I got much more accomplished than I thought I would. I figured that after my last class I would just take a nap. But instead, I went to the gym and had a great workout. It's always good to make a plan of everything that you want to do in a day. I always have to do lists. They are so useful, and I feel so organized when I make them. And when I finish everything on one list, I feel so good. It is a great feeling. I haven't been having too many great feelings recently. I'm not sure if I like it here. I don't think I ever will either; that is what bothers me the most. Everyone keeps telling me that it is going to get better, that I'll meet more and more people that I like. I just don't think it's going to happen. I really wish I had gone to Brandeis, for things would be so much easier. It is a smaller school, near Boston, much closer to my parents. Then I'd be able to see Brian and Jessie so much more often. I probably could see them every weekend if I wanted to. My phone bill would definitely be a hell of a lot less. That would be so good, because I don't have enough money. I feel bad asking for more from my parents, but it would just be so much easier. I think I really want to apply for that job at George Women. That is definitely a cool store because it has everything that I love there! Another thing I have noticed about being a college student, is that now I don't care about how I look or dress or anything like that. In high school, it was such a big deal to wear the ""right"" clothes and things like that. I didn't even mind doing that, and it seemed normal. I just miss my friends so much. I made such great connections with three people in high school, and I miss them so much. I am so jealous of all my friends who are so close to each other. Why do I have to get stuck with going to this huge school? It's not fair that I have to go through so many changes all at the same time. I just wish things were easier. It would make me so much happier. I feel like I have done something awful, that I deserve to feel like crap. I know that if I just keep on going, day by day, then things have to get better. I'm just so used to having so many friends and knowing so many people. I have just gotten thrown into this huge pile of people, and not knowing any of them is just plain weird. I just hope that getting use to this school will be a lot easier and quicker than it seems like it will be. I think that things will become so much better once I get used to this school. I certainly hope so because I just want to be happy. ",1

291,"Right now I'm sitting here at my brothers house. I'm very tired and wish I was in my bed. We had a Tri-Delt meeting tonight and I'm so overwhelmed with all the stuff we have to do. It just seems like their is something everyday. I wish I could just do some stuff and not all of it. I hate other people having control over me and telling how I have to spend my afternoon. I just want to be able to study, meet people, and sleep. Maybe I shouldnÃ¯Â¿Â½t have joined a sorority. Oh well!  I just need a break everything is happening so fast and I'm having second thoughts about the whole Tri-Delt thing because I really don't know anybody yet. Maybe once I start to meet people I feel more comfortable. I'm very excited because my dad is coming to Austin thurs-sunday. He is going to the game with us and taking us out to eat. I haven't talked to my dad in awhile so I can't wait to see him. I guess I'm a little homesick or at least more than I let show. I just worry that I/m the only one feeling this way and I don't want to look like a big crying baby to my roommate. But I don't really care what my roommate thinks because she gets on my nerves have the time and is not that much fun to be around. She is not interested in the same stuff I am and just sits around and plays on the computer. Well enough about that. I'm really hungry but I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t want to eat anything because I worry about gaining the freshman 15. All my roommate eats is fat fat FAT. So their is all kinds of junk food in my room and I get tempted to eat it. She isn't worried about her weight. I very excited because this girl who is one of my pledge sisters asked me to room with her next year in an apartment with to other girls. She is real nice and I was surprised that she asked me to live with her. I said yes but I will have to talk to my mom because she is the one paying for everything. Last night was the weirdest thing I set down and started thinking about all my friends that are off at different schools. This was the first time that I had the chance since I've been here to think about everyone and wonder what they are doing. I even thought about my camp friends and how it seems like a year ago that I was with them. It was just two months ago. I wish I was back their right now because I had no worries and was so happy with everyone their. Well it has been 20 min. so I guess I'll let you go. Got to go study!!!!! ",1

I've met a lot of fun people. oh my goodness, i get my hair cut this weekend!!!! i am so excited. this is as long as I've had it in a long time. im so glad to get out of my home town. its so small and so judgmental. every one knows every thing about every one in the town. just the other day an article was written to high school extra about how horrible the coaches in my home town were and some slandering was going on and now there are lawyers and police involved. oh well i guess im not involved in that, thank god. this psy class is interesting and thank god for that, because if not i would prob. fail the course. wow ntwenty min is a lot longer than i thought. im running out of things to say, and that is not usually the case. most of the time i can't quit talking and never find it hard to think of another subject to talk about. i don't have a boyfrien and thats because i don't like answering to people and thats what a high school relationship is. my best frien dane, he was almost a boyfriend, we could never decide what we wanted to do and until a week before he left to college and now he plays football there so i realy never get to see him. but we still stay in contact. foolish pride i guess. well that and i was never able to stay commited and i guess that was the real problem. i didnt want to be held down and i know thats what it would have been like so i just avoided it. scared of commitment? a little but who isn't. plus why just have one when you can have many and more. i sound like the typical guy, but i whos to judge.

964,"I don't know how to start a paper like this but I'll do my best. I really miss my mom and my sister, but most of all I miss my boyfriend Michael. He means so much to me and I feel as if our relationship is falling apart because I live a 100 miles away. I don't know how to get over this feeling of loneliness. I meet a lot of people but I still always think of him. He is so understanding too. He said he would understand if I wanted to date other guys. But to be honest with you, I don't. I know I am too young right now to know if my feelings are real but no one up here even compares to him and that really scares me. I cry every night because I miss him so much. I'm tired of crying and feeling scared. I want Michael to be here with me but that is impossible. I went home this past weekend and I realized how much I loved it. I never wanted to come back to Austin. I hate it here. Nothing is secure and there is no one to count on. I wish I could go back home but I can't. I would transfer somewhere closer but I am in one of the top business schools and if I get out then I might never get back in. Don't get me wrong, this is an outstanding school, I am just so homesick. I guess in time though it will get better. Everyone says that the first few months are hard for freshmen. It is such a big adjustment to make. I just hope I will adjust. What if I never do?  Then what happens?  Am I to be unhappy forever?  That is how I feel right now. That I will never be happy again as long as I am here and Michael is down there. Maybe I will feel like that for 2 more years, maybe I won't. One can never know. Sometimes I write poetry to ease my mind. I find that it really helps me express my feelings. Whoever is reading this, do you know of a poetry class or something that I could take?  I think I would really like that. I also want to  learn how to play the piano. Then Michael could play the guitar and I could play the piano. That would be interesting. I wish Christmas holidays would come so I could go home for an extended period of time. I never thought that I would miss it this much, but I do. I think I want to live in my hometown when I grow up. It is such a nice town. Everybody knows everybody and it is so safe. And there I won't be alone. I hate being alone. I'm tired of being alone. I have friends here but they can only do so much. It takes that extra person to really get you over the hump, unfortunately he does not live here. Maybe someday, we can be together again. At least that is what I dream of at night. He is the only one that makes me truly happy. well, time is up! ",1
2224,"well I'm sitting in the library doing the writing assignment for psychology class. This is really fun. I just finished writing down my notes for astronomy class because I have a quiz in there on Thursday. I went home this past weekend. Nothing really exciting happened. I visited with my family for memorial day. My cousin was nominated for homecoming queen. Wow. Not. Anyway yeah. I'm back now. It was weird having to pack to go home. I saw a movie over the weekend, wicker park was the name of it. It was really good. I thought that it wasn't going to be that good but I really liked it, it was a love story and I'm always a sucker for those. well the time is going by really slowly. I want to get back to my room so I can watch my favorite TV show of all time. Big brother. it's almost over so it's getting exciting. I don't think I spelled that right. O well. This is the easiest assignment I think that I've ever been assigned. Wow. 20 min is a really long time. I still have 15 more minutes to go. ummm. I've been in the library a really long time. And I still need to finish the pre-screening survey for this class so I can get experiment credit. I'm really tired. My friend Jennifer is sitting next to me. She already did the assignment. I wish I was in my bed right now. I'm always tired these days. I'm liking college so far. I miss home sometimes and it seems like I miss it at the weirdest times but I think I'm adjusting pretty well. At least I think so. I left my medicine at home so I'm having trouble breathing. But my mom is sending it to me so I can feel better soon. I have to go to a UT football game for an assignment in my freshman seminar class but I didn't buy a sports package which by the way I think is the stupidest think I've ever heard of. I think if you're a student then you should be able to get into the game for free but what do I know. Anyway so I need to find somebody with an extra ticket that they want to give me. um I like all my professors except my freshman seminar prof. He picks on me because I'm quiet and I don't talk much. I hate when teachers do that. It really bugs me . I like listening to people talk. O man I still have 8 min to go. Blah blah. um a little while ago this guy was sitting next to me and he kept farting. It smelt so bad. Luckily he left because I don't think I would have been able to take it much longer. well now I can't think of anything to write so maybe I'll sing a song. ""on Monday I'm waiting, Tuesday I'm fading and by Wednesday I can't sleep. Then the phone rings I hear you and the darkness is a clear view because you've come to rescue me"". That was Ashley Simpson. I like her because she has the same name as me even though she doesn't spell it the right way. That's ok I guess I can forgive her. I like her sister, Jessica, too even if she is a dumb blond sometimes but at least she's herself unlike so many other people I know that try to copy what other people do and they can't come up with a unique thought if their live depended on it. Well I only have 3 minutes left. Thank goodness. It seems like I've been typing forever. Well my hand are getting tired of typing and I keep misspelling stuff so I have to keep on pressing the backspace button and I'm really tired. I've already said that but that's all I can think of right now. My eyes keep wanting to close. Good only one more minute and then I'm going to go and take a nap. O wait I can't. I have too much reading to do. That's all I do these days is read, read, read, and then I read some more. bye         ",0
1231,"I really don't now exactly what to write. my mind is just blank. I met this really hot guy at my dorm and I want to keep talking to him. he doesn't remind me of Rain Meada at all but what can I say. my vision is blurred today probably because of the ozone warnings. I can't believe that it was 112 degrees the other day. I wish that I would have made the dance team, but I guess I knew that I wouldn't. I really want to change my major. I hate ballet with a passion and today I felt sick to my stomach in class because I hate it so much. brandon makes me so mad because he acts gay all the time. what is up with him and jennifer, why don't they just date or something. I wonder if jen really likes jansen or what. I really want a boyfriend. I dreamed about kevin last night and it was so weird because he was actually being nice. I was sick and in the hospital or something and he was taking care of me. I want to meet justin timberlake so bad. I just want to have sex with him. I miss my brother and I can't believe that my father hasn't called me in over 3 months. And he didn't even come to my graduation. ugh. I really don't like my classes and I already have trouble getting myself to class. I am such a bad student. I wonder where sammy is today? I really want him back but that will never happen. I pretend that there is a chance but I am kidding myself now that he is with mrs. perfect. jen lovey. I don't know that pisses me off so much I want to scream. I think it was the same guy in class today that said mating choices that asked who was single the first day. I will have to go and meet him. I'm hungry and I feel extremely fat. I was thinking today about why people swing their arms when they walk. that reminds me of seinfeld and when Elaine makes fun of the woman who doesn't swing her arms. I think I like patobut I'm not really attracted to him. I wonder if you can actually like someone as in love if you aren't attracted to them. maybe I am and I just don't want to admit it. the mind is so weird. It psychs you out to think one thing but then you get all confused because you don't know if that is what you really think. that was complicated. I feel bad that I have not made time for God in my life and I want to but then I find fun things to do and forget. I need to pray about that. I can't wait to meet the man that I'm going to marry. I'm looking at this picture of my best friend from high school and not one thought comes to my head. sometimes I think that it was good we went our own ways because we were getting tired of each other. I feel bad for casey and I really need to call daniel. patrick is the rudest boy in the world. I don't think he has ever been nice to me. Oh well his loss. I am so broke right now. I need to get a loan but the stupid texas thing is gay and won't work. I wonder if my finger is broken or not. I can't decide if I want to try out for the ut dance team or not. what is up with all my homework. I never have a life anymore. I think I'm really going to hate school. maybe I will drop out and go back home and work at heb. my life is going nowhere. its not like I'm actually going to dance on broadway so what's the point of even trying for it. I hate writing journals for dumb modern class. That's a bunch of crap. this school is so messed up with all its procedures and freaking lines that are always miles long. my feet are killing me. I need to go to the chiropractor. where is melissa. what is she doing? I'm thinking that this is the easiest writing assignment I've ever done. my English teacher mrs. dillard ran away with another teacher and got married and I never saw her again. that was strange. and my dad did that too. he told me in a mexican food restaurant and I wanted to kill him. oh and the orange drink that we used to drink and the wasp that was trapped in the house and I started crying. my dog died when I was little. I miss my cat at home but I don't want to go home and see my mom. she will drive me crazy. brittney spears is such a hoe. if she slept with justin that is gross. I want to meet him and ask him. I think I will. Birmingham is going to be tight. the drive sucks but to meet him I would do anything. man I just want to know what it would be like to kiss him. ohhhh, dang I can't wait. I want to talk to zal. I wonder if he is back from paris yet? I think I'm don't know so yeah. ",0
532,"I'm planning a trip to South Padre, and I don't exactly have any real place to stay(besides the car). I guess I always feel a little more nervous about the state of my affairs before I do any physical activity during the day. I think that the endorphins make a big change in my thoughts and state of being. I enjoy physical activity to for the competitive aspect. Recently, I've come to enjoy more extreme sports such as mountain biking, street hockey, and surfing. These sports seem to add an aspect of danger which makes the adrenaline run even faster. It reminds of the Goo Goo Dolls song ""Iris"" where the singer writes about ""bleeding just to know your alive. ""  The mixture of hard physical workout and a sense of danger accompanied with adrenaline add color to life where it wasn't there before and give a sense of perspective to other areas of life. I can't help but wonder if this passage is being influenced by the music I'm listening to on the CD player. I think that it's probably still an accurate representation because I don't know  if music can do anything but influence or bring out different parts of yourself. Speaking of music I'm going to play guitar as much as I possibly can now because I've beaten the video game Goldeneye. I'd also like to start writing more. I haven't written in awhile and it's something that I've been missing. The opportunity to be reflective and listen to yourself is a wonderful thing which I haven't been taking advantage of lately. I'd like to publish a book eventually with the sum of a lot of my writing. It would be like a journal of varied types of entries which would open a gateway into the inner recesses of my mind, a window into the core of my being. There are many different enjoyable aspects to writing. In addition to the chance to look at yourself and life, the ability to meld your thoughts into words in the most eloquent way possible is a fabulous thrill. Speaking of acts of creation, I would also like to take more pictures with my new camera. I'm trying to expand my self as a visual artist through photography. I hope to capture a little of the essence of my experiences through the lens of the camera. I took some really good pictures on my last two rolls. The best picture appears to be the result of serendipity. I took a picture at Mesa Verde of some of the Indian ruins, and out of the shadows of the rocks, a giant face appears. It's an incredible picture. It's a better picture than I thought I'd ever take. I hope I have the gift of capturing beauty on film. It would be a neat talent to have. ",1
2315,"This past weekend I took a short journey back to my home city of San Antonio, Texas. I went there to get some more items from my house, and as you can tell I'm still in the process of moving in all of my belongings into my dorm. The dorm itself I like very much because it is a good enough distance from the university itself so that I can feel as though I am actually going home each day after classes; plus the food here is excellent. This semester so far has been going by a little slow just as the first few weeks of every school year do. However, last week was very satisfying due to the fact that I got much accomplished. I got much of my studying done and I finally got my book situation in order. At first when I went to the Co-op I bought all these different books for each of the classes I am taking and then I came to discover that I didn't need about three of them. So then I had to make time to go back and return the books that I no longer needed, and I had the pleasure of standing in the horrendous line it seemed they formed just for me. This weekend I also went to the football game to see my favorite team in the land play a not-so-good team, but I still managed to have a great time. I bought two tickets for my brother and my best friend who came in to visit me. The day after the game when I went back to San Antonio I got to visit with my baby brother who is now about seven months old. He is beginning to talk and make little noises that babies make. I was a little sad to leave him so soon after his birth, but I will see him every now and then when I get a chance to journey back home. I also got to spend time with my girlfriend of about two years. We went out to eat and to see a movie. We weren't sure what movie to see so I thought I would let her pick because of the nice that I am, and she - being the girl that she is - picked wicker park which is a story about this guy who falls in love with a girl two years ago and he sees her walking down the street. He immediately bolts out the door of the shoe store he is standing in and tries to catch her, but his friend stops him to talk and he loses her, but to make a long story short he gets sidetracked bye this psycho girl who falls in love with him and is trying to keep him away from the girl who he originally wanted. In the end he finally gets to talk to the first girl and they are happy as can be. I can't wait for winter time. It is definitely one of my favorite times of the year because each year my family and I go skiing in Colorado - occasionally some place different - and go to most of the resorts there. One of the worst times I've ever had there is when I wrecked one of the rental cars we brought with us, and also this past year we went and I jumped a big snow jump, landed wrong, and I smashed my head into some ice leaving myself with a nice concussion. All together I would have to say that I'm very excited about this year, and I can't wait to meet more people and have some of the most memorable times of my life. ",1
406,"I just came back home to Austin from Houston this morning. It was not a bad drive today. I am now at home relaxing for the remainder of the day. I really kind of miss home but I guess I will get used to living on my own after a little while. I miss my parents and girlfriend. It is hard to leave the people you care about the most knowing you won't see them for a period of time. Hopefully though I will start to meet many new people here at the University of Texas. I really like Austin, now I just need to explore it. I know a few people up here and they have helped make it a lot easier to be here. I hope school is not too terribly hard. I know I must study and do all of my assignments and make sure I do not fall behind. I think reading and attending class are two of the most important elements of college. I am somewhat scared though at the fact that three tests comprise your semester grade. If you do bad on an exam, you will really have to work hard to pull yourself back up. I just don't know?  I need to get into the routine of college before I can give a valid evaluation of what college really is to me. I hope I do well. Enough with school. I am so excited to be living on my own. I have new responsibilities as well as many new freedoms. There is nobody here to tell me when to come home or what to do. I am the superior. With this new freedom though I know I must watch and take care of myself. No one is here to pick up after me and no one is here to watch over me which is kind of frightening. It creates a sense of happiness, but at the same time a sense of fear also. ",1
1087,there is so much to do in my life. I am really really stress out about school. family. friends and boys I don't know why. but the past two guys that I've dated just suddenly doesn't like me anymore I really really wonder every time I think about it. maybe my personality. or maybe my physical attraction and all the want is one thing. and that is what I wouldn't give up well. there is so much to do in school. I have so much homework everyday and I don't know I hate precal. and I have homework in that class all the time and now I have to worry about the precal test on Monday. and dietary analysis do on Friday. and nutrition and psychology test on Monday after that oh my gosh I guess the professors just like to torture us by having due dates and test all in the same day and I have a tennis tryout on Monday. that means I have to skip my psychology class and my tasp thing. gosh. and I don't know why. but I just can't pass tasp I know that English is my second language but I've written so many paper. and I do ok on them but I just don't understand why I can't pass writing part on the tasp this is crazy. and since this is the first semester in ut I haven't got an apartment and so my parents is making me living with our family friends and I really really don't enjoy being with them so. I really really don't want to stay there either. I don't even mind to drive everyday back and forth so why do they care. if the gas money is what they are worry about. I'll go work and earn my gas money and I really really need to study. but you know you have to study in a place to you like but. I guess they just don't understand and also my dad always say. why do you come home anyway. because you are never home. but I am always home you know he is always at work. so he can't say anything but if he just ask my sister than everything is different oh well. my life is going downhill right now. but I guess I can handle it I just wish that I can be a little bit more smarter because. I study but I just don't know why sometimes I still can't get it but oh well and I just got a new car but I just don't want to drive back and forth because that would be too much miles I don't know why I worry so much about my miles either gosh. I really really hate staying in Austin I want to come home but I don't know why they won't let me is not like they have to drive me back and forth I am the one who have to drive oh well life sucks right now but it's all good I can handle this situation but. hmm. school is kicking my butt and I don't have any friends there yet. am I just a loser I really didn't think like that before but I guess I am. am I really not likable because I thought I was before but everything changed when I decide to come to ut. and ut is so big. I thought that I would make friends really really easily. but I guess not. I really really hope that I would do good in school. and hope to find a nice guy and hope that everything will go where they need to go I really really hate my life right now and I am so tired all the time but I guess is because I am not getting enough to sleep. and now. I have to work out really hard because I don't play tennis anymore so I feel so fat all the time but oh well I guess I just have to work harder now  ,0
2376,"Autumn will be here soon. I wake up, get myself together, look out the window at the morning roar of the bitter city. Down. Down the elivator once again, floor 13, now floor 1. I step ouside and inhale, a cold rush of life crystalizing in my lungs. This is where I realsize that everyday is but a breath. That single inhale was a day, was a life. Old postcards line my smile. I am a story, and I tear up when I thumb through my dusty file cabnet of experiences. My eyes desperately search for ideas, while I know they are all within some governing organ I possess. Heart or head, it doesn't matter. but I find it odd that my eyes do the searching. My little fan is growling at me. It's probably upset that I always leave it on. Let me turn it off really quick. Ok. Done. I heard a door shut. The people in my dorm are an infestation. I cannot STAND them. I try so hard to see the good within everyone, but how can I if they are all the same. Everyday I walk around the autumn grasping campus and I look. Look at people, the sky, the earth, the buildings. but the people. I LOOK at the people. They make me laugh! We are so strange. I see people trying to avoid the world as they bounce down the gravel paths with an iPod pumping sound into their skulls. People who try to look sexy. People who look mad at the world, and sneer at you, the person mearly trying to understand some fraction on their existance and importance. People look at me too. What is it that I possess that makes their eyes flick up for even an instance to make contact with mine. My heart races when they do that. It's kind of a love. I love them for that one milisecond. I understand them for one lapse of time. But did they look at me because I was looking toward them? Am I attractive to them? Am I mysterious? Scary? Sexy? Sometimes people LOOK at me. That's my job. I absolutely hate being in here. Trapped between machine and the cement walls around me. I cannot stand the fact that our society is ruled by technology and media. I don't watch TV, I don't keep up with any news, I listen to music and read books. entertainment is all I need on media terms. We should kill our TV's though. As one of my favorite bands says ""I wish the world was flat like the old days"". I have to say: Amen. We need to evolve backwards! We need to get back to the old way of life, religion, and appreciate the earth and sky, appreciate our unique existence in the universe. We need to notice our equality before we notice the differences. But, I suppose it's just wishfull thinking. ",0

I didn't used to like them but man are they awesome. especially  after reading philosophy, stupid philosophy its so boring but the lectures are cool. I  don't know I usually don't like to discuss abortion and stuff like that because your  not going to change anyones mind so what's the point in fighting because that's all  your doing is fighting I don't like to fight I think its stupid because your hurting other  people and not gaining anything from it so its useless hurt thatno one needs ihate  pain I hate to make other people sad I hate to be sad. good thing I like it here or I  might be misreable almost done 17  min and 30 seconds. sweet this has taken  forever I should be reading something or studying or something like that I want to  do well in colllege grade wise ireally want to make a 3. 8 at least my mom made a  4. 0 in really hard classes last semester now granted that's my mom and she isn't  doing as much socially as I am so she has more time to study, well actually she  workds all the time. I never really realized how hard she must have worked. its  college that makes you realize stuff like that ",0
2103,"Well, I am now officially writing my first college paper"" more or less. It is really hot outside today. I wonder when it is going to cool of so I won't swear so bad when I walk to class. I think that I need to really concentrate on my homework and studies when I get them, instead of putting them off. It makes me feel like I am bogged down when I have a lot of stuff to do at once. It is actually really stressful. I kind of like this song that is on the radio. Busta Rhymes has not ever been my favorite rapper, but I think that this song is ok. Pharrell really makes this song what it is. Now come to think of it. I don't think that Busta Rhymes sang that song. oh well I guess that this assignment is for my thoughts and mistakes, so I won't correct my mistake. My chair is pretty comfortable. Hopefully I will do my homework in it when I am done with this writing assignment. The longhorns really kicked New Mexico State's butt. I think that Chance Mock (the quarterback) got to a ruff start, but he has waited for several years to get his chance to play as the Longhorn's Quarterback. Although Vincent Young came in towards the end of the game and did phenomenal, scoring 2 touchdowns on his own rush attempts, and throwing a great 60 yard pass, I believe that Mock should continue to start as QB because he has put in his time as scout team player. My, that was a really long sentence. I am tired of eating the food at the Jester Food Court. They have a big selection, but the selections never change at each station. I kinda miss my mom's home cooking. I can get over that. I was aware that there was a ton of students at this campus, but I guess that I didn't think that I would see so many people going to class everyday. I kind of feel like a minority in Austin. Coming from a small town in East Texas that is mostly white, black, and mexican, I am not used to seeing so many asian students. I am not against asian people at all, I just have never seen so many at one setting such as UT. The temperature in my dorm is not to my liking. I am a very hot natured person, and I prefer that it be cold in my room. Being all covered up under your blankets at night when it is cold is a great feeling. I dislike sweating when I sleep. I need to go to the gym today. I am getting out of my routine of working out each day. I need to get on a balanced routine between schoolwork and play. It is kind of hard to be disciplined once you don't have your parents to tell you what to do. The experience at UT is a good one though and I am not complaining. The only thing I dislike about it right now is that I still have yet to purchase all my schoolbooks. The Co-op did not have my MIS book today like that re-order said. Nothing is ever perfect. That is not a bad thing though. I hope that all of our writing assignments are this easy CZAR. This is an easy grade. There are so many fine girls here at UT. Everywhere you look you see a hottie. I love that. Some of them seem fake to me though, but I know that I shouldn't judge people. My phone is ringing and I am almost done. Alright I am done. Later. ",0
2251,"This is what I need to do. Type with my friends in the messenger its really ADDICTING. LMaoOO. Well I love to listen to music. Its really soothing for me and I fell weird with out it. I LOVE TUTY of BRazeros Musical( ; ; my favorite group) I wonder when they are going to come back. (this there one of there songs. Lloviendo esta y atra vez de la lluvia te llevas con tigo a la cuidad entera mis lagrimas no miras la lluvia las confuendedn y aunque yo este llorando por mi no te preocupes. Te esperare te esperare aunque no vuelas mas. Llenaste mi rtecuerdos a la cuidad entera. Y aunque yo se que nunca mas tu volveras. "" Lagrimas y Llubia by Brazeros Musical. Who did I get backstage. It was all a rush. But am glas I did. I meet one of my favorite groups. They were nice. There performance was great. Although at the end they stinked musty and were all sweaty they were forth it. Armando and Junior were the cutest of them all. I was surprised that Luis recognized me. there is nothing special about me and well. He was remembered how my face looked like. I Hate this song put I cannot tell my roommate its from the 80s or something like that its OLD. ""In the car wash. "" maybe because I heard it for too long. Its a remix. Its lonely in my room. I have nothing to do but be here in the computer. Reflecting back on high school it was exciting but I wish we could've done better things to make it wonderful and more unforgettable. I Made it to PROM Court. I was Beaten by a girl That never attended school. How can all these people that don't go to school ever always pass and get better things then me and my friends. We were all great students. And never broke the rules!!! Its beb 11 mins and well I have a million things tuning through my head. I miss my family (as whole) because they went to MEXICO with out me. This the first year they do it and I feel left out. But am having a blast here in the University of Texas and I cannot ask for anything better. I Love Austin. This were I been living for 18 years. I think I love music because of this ""The Live Music Capital of the World"" music was everywhere I turned in the neighbors house, down in the drive through of McDonalds. In the Laundry thing and well my mom Loves to dance. Which leaves me think. What am I going to do with my obsession of taking pics of different artist that come and do concert. I love to meet them and makes my groups of friends grow more. ""the artist"" for most part are really down to earth and I look forward to every dance there is. Its Been two weeks since school started, yet our room still STINKS!!!!!! We cannot take the smell out. Being in the ninth floor. We cannot do much of it. plus were in the middle of Nowhere land stuck in a Corner were no body comes an visit us. That's good in some part because we can study and listen to music as high as we want to and none says anything. Its sunny outside its not HOT like it usually is. I love it when it rains but there is also going to rain. That little breeze of air that vlows thriugh my hair is unbelivable. I love that smell of wet grass as well. UMmmmmmmmmmmm. So one did PoPcoRn and I smell it all the way over here. 10,9,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 sorry I got distracted by the timer less then am done. It been distracting since it started ",1
342,"I really want to go swimming but I don't want to tell Sylvia that I don't want to see her dumb brother play in that stupid baseball game. I really want to go home this weekend. I know for a fact that my mom would never let me go well maybe she would let me go out with Gera even after I haven't seen her for a while. Maybe I just don't want to go out with him I think that I feel guilty for some strange reason and I can't get the courage to tell Gera. This air conditioner is really bothering me. It makes so much noise and does not cool very much. I am so hungry. My roommate sucks. I don't know why I'm so mean. Maybe I'm just not used to someone always wanting to know everything I do. Maybe she's just too smart and I feel stupid. I'm really hungry. I don't know how I'm going to get to eat if I go with Sylvia and Loni. I wonder if Gera is calling me right at this moment. I wonder how come his dad didn't say goodbye before hanging up. I think I'm  making too much noise typing. I get the feeling that I'm disturbing everyone behind me. I can't believe Loni. She just met this guy today and she already has him in her room. I wonder if her parents know the way she is. I still have one more question to do for Economics and I don't really feel like reading. I learned that I should wait to be told what to read before I stress That stress test Sylvia and I took was weird. I think that man thought that my life was pretty boring. I bet he thought I was weird. He could right away tell what was bothering Sylvia. I know that Manny really has Sylvia thinking about him day and night. He's such a jerk. I can't believe what How could someone treat someone that way. Maybe love is blind. I wonder why people around here are so free. I can't believe that girl I say two days ago. She was wearing next to nothing and felt no shame. I assume she must have felt fresh or something but doesn't she have one bit of self respect for herself. I wonder why the lady behind me just apologized to the girl. I had to turn around for a second. I think that I'm a nosy person. I often catch myself eavesdropping on other people's conversations. During lunch today I listened to two complete conversations. I could not believe the things that people talk about. Why does my roommate have to be so selfish. I think that I want to make everyone healthy. I don't know why but I am so self conscience of the way I look. But I hear that is actually average in girls my age. I went all out on this diet until I lost up to 25 pounds and now I think that I am too skinny. but I say this girl today that was a bit over weight and she was beautiful, then why do I gross myself out when I see my roommate eating horrible and then I see her change and I feel that I have to go workout. She gets offended very easily. I don't even tell her anything about her weight or anything related to that subject anyway and she jumps up and becomes aggravated very quickly. ",1
1868,"  There is to much traffic in austin. I am ready to see my girlfriend this weekend. I am glad it is almost the weekend. The buses outside are to loud it is annoying. I guess it is really annoying when someone srives by with loud music in the middle of the night or rotc marches by. I'm thirsty I think I will get so water. I like this deja blue container it works good to refill. On yea that nice and cold. I guess I need to study my spanish when I am done with this. I wonder how my parents are doing, I guess I should call them pretty soon. Five min. and twenty seconds this is going by pretty fast. Tomorrow is friday horray. I am not really sure if that is how horray is spelled. It probaly isn't in the dictionary. There are always car alarms going off if someones car acutually gets robbed no one will know whose it is. That would suck. I like my bob marley poster it is interesting. I guess I should go work out a little today before work. I'll bet work is really boring tonight unless there are a lot of people at the fields. who know. That water tastes good. This psychology is kind of interesting but I still don't know what I am going to major in. It really does bug me I wish I could figure it out. Oh well mabye it will just hit me one day mabye I should just have fun. I need a different soap I don't really like this dail. I wish I wouldn't of bought a big ass bottle of it. It will take forever for me to use it. I wonder whats on tv. It would be kind of hard to watch will I am typing. I want hook up my speakers to my computer, I need to find that damn chord. I need to find someone with a printer for biology homework. What am I going to do when I am done with this I don't know if I really want to study. I guess I have to since I have to work tonight. Wow it is eighty degrees in here. I wonder how acurrate that galelio theremometer is. It seems like it would be pretty acurrate. galelio was a smart guy so why not. looks hot outside im glad I don't have to go out there till later. although it still won't be all that cool.   ",1
788,"I already miss Greg. I had forgotten how much fun we had together. Talking in depth ahbout philosophy and relationships. We also enjoyed playing cards and James Bond. I npticed Mark has taken a liking to Bond and he always plays it while on my bed. I can't belive he was sick and lying in my bed. All this and the fact that he can't make a joke well make me want him to hook up with Emily. They were made for each other. He does have a sense of homur thought. Atleast he isn't to weird a roomate. I do feel bad that I haven't taken out the trash yet. OIther than that I think I have been a good roomate. I think I made him jealous when Sarah and I were kding around. I could feel him shutting himself off from us and dwelling on his own sorrow that I am still convinced is caused by the fact that Emily and him are apart. I hope my relationship will prosper. Some changes need to be made on my controlling attention and Sarah trying to do the same. I don't belive the problems lie much more deeper than that, Altough I am looking at it from that perspective as well. I think if we continue to become aware of our prior mistakes happiness will prevail. We do have a good future if we have a liittle more personal attention and inner thought. I miss her now but I am glad she is out so that I may do my work including what I am doing now. I wonder if we will be able to eat together and if so, where and when. If O haven't heard from herr by 7:00 than I'll have a sandwhich here while I watch Simpson/X-Files and the inbetween, whatever the station decides needs a boast in ratings. I think it is so rediculous how most people will have little or only practical things toi do but will turn on the TV and zone out as they flip mindlessly thropught the same channels they just saw. If people would check out the TV schedule than maybe they could plan when to watch certain shows and when to do other tasks like reading a book of interest. Speaking of books, I have but a thousand to read. The Hobbit, Lord of the rings, that Star-Wars book, that buddism one, the Tenth Insight, The experiential guides and the Celestine Vision. I also want to read the bible for my own study and not because it was being forced on me. I don't believe in the present idea of God but see him more as just energy of which everything is made. Perhaps the tales will have some metaphoric meaning within my life as it has my parents. I still doubt that I will pick Christianity as my system of metaphors. I may actually be able to construck my own relegion with no influence from otheer religions that have meaning or scientific marrit. ",1
1410,"I'm sitting here thinking that it's rather nice that the Ethernet in my dorm is finally up, although I feel bad that my roommate is still having problems with her computer. She has an IBM Aptiva and it seems that the wireless Ethernet card just doesn't agree with her system. I staring at my philosophy book in front of me, and I think that drug legalization is an interesting subject. I've never considered drug legalization before. I always thought that drugs were bad and that was the final end to the case. However, all these philosophers (who aren't all that old and ancient) think that legalizing drugs might be a good idea. Not that they want to promote drug use and make it easy to obtain for everyone, but legalized in a restricted fashion like cigarettes and alcohol. I also need to write some letters to my friends and stuff back home after this assignment since I haven't talked to them in such a long time. I can't decide which sort of stationary to use since I collect stationary and stickers, so there is a wide variety to choose from. I miss them greatly since I don't have as many friends in Austin as I do back in Houston. I haven't been here long enough. There are my roommates, though. As a matter of fact, I'm curious about whom my roommate is calling right now since he seems like a close friend. She's talking about food since she didn't get any before she came back, and that makes my stomach respond slightly. I only had 3 slices of pizza for dinner, and that apparently isn't enough since my stomach rumbled when my roommate mentioned food. She also asked me if a friend of ours was 21 or not, but I don't know. He's a nice guy since he helped me with my phone jack. I couldn't plug in my phone since the jack had been painted over to the point where the wires can't even register each other. I think I'm running out of things to say since I can't imagine what else might be of interest to occupy my mind. I've nothing to look forward to this evening except reading assignments from all of my classes. I realize that reading is essential to the learning process, but all these long chapters are tedious. There isn't too much of great interest in reading these heavy textbooks. I wish we had textbooks like they do in Japan. Their textbooks are really small and light so they don't get backaches and have to lug around huge backpacks. Perhaps people in America will slowly grow shorter since the weight of backpacks stunts the growth of young people in this country while Japanese children grow taller with the freedom of light backpacks. It would also be nice if international music from Japan and other countries would be more accessible here. It's hard to find Japanese popular music in Texas. You have to either order them off the Internet, or look for the small stores that specialize in importing these types of CDs. It is rather expensive, too, but it is kind of ironic that Japanese CDs also cost about $30 in American dollars in Japan. CDs are cheapest in Taiwan since they only cost about $5$10american dollars there. It would be nice if I could visit Taiwan often, but I don't have the time and plane tickets cost more money than I have to spend on leisure travel in a year. I think that is a pity since I would like to see my uncle and my grandmother more often. And the fruits in Taiwan are of a much greater variety and sweetness. The same type of fruit here is much smaller in size and a great deal more expensive. They don't taste the same either. I think my dad misses Taiwan the most, although he has made many friends in Houston. I miss having Chinese food every night, too. It feels weird not using chopsticks for two weeks in a row. I have to remember to bring some the next time I went back to Houston. I really miss my dad's cooking. He cooks really well. And he knows where all the good Chinese restaurants are. It's hard for me to order food myself since I don't know the names of the dishes. The names I do know are in Chinese, so sometimes I pronounce them wrong and the waitress gives me this funny look. I think the food I like best at this particular time is Vietnamese noodles, dim sum, and this chicken steak with rice. I think I can get Vietnamese noodles here, but dim sum is something best eaten in a big city because it's a specialty that only some cooks can get right. I am not sure about the last one since I am unfamiliar with the Chinese restaurants around campus. It is something I may do during the weekend, exploring the nearby food places to see what is good to eat around here. I really talk about food a lot when I'm hungry, it seems. There isn't much in my room's refrigerator since I haven't gotten anything as of late, and it would be rude to eat everything that my roommates bought. I shall have to go to the store in the morning or after school to obtain some snacks for when I am hungry like I am now. The cafeteria here closes at 7 PM so I can't do anything about being hungry at the moment. I have a screen mate program that creates little lambs to wander around my computer screen. There are five of them wandering around right now, and one of them just sneezed. I think it is funny since I just sneezed recently. These lambs are very adorable, and they don't take up much computer space. They sleep and jump around, basically entertaining me while I'm doing my homework or just when I'm surfing around the Internet. I love being connected to the Internet at all times since all of my classes post important information on the web, and because I like to do personal research of my own into the subjects and hobbies I cultivate. It is also good for multiplayer games, but there seems to be a firewall in my dorm network that prevents me from hosting such games. It aggravates me greatly, but at least I can participate with a steady connection unlike when I used to use AOL. ",0
299,"WELL, I DON'T LNOW WHAT ALL TO TYPE ABOUT, SINCE WE CAN TYPE ABOUT ANYTHING. MY BOYFRIEND THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN SINCE I MOVED DOWN HERE THREE WEEKS AGO CAME DOWN TODAY FROM DALLAS, SO I'M PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT THAT.

MY BOYFRIEND IS BORED OUT OF HIS MIND, BECAUSE HE WANTS TO PLAYS GAMES BUT CAN'T GET ON A COMPUTER. I THINK THIS PSYCHOLOGY COURSE IS GOING TO BE HARD, BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE CLASS. FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLR IS A BIT TOO MANY PEOPLE TO HAVE IN ONE CLASS--HOW WILL ANYONE LEARN ANYTHING?  ALSO, THE WHOLE EXPERIMENT THING IS VERY STRANGE. WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO STUDY ABOUT US?  I SURE AS HECK AM NOT GOING TO WRITE A RESEARCH PAPER, THOUGH. I HATE WRITING PAPERS!  I'M GLAD THAT WE DON'T HAVE A FINAL IN OUR CLASS. BUT I HAVE A FINAL IN MY PHILOSOPHY CLASS, AND IT'S ALSO ON THE LAST DAY. THAT SUCKS. I WAS HOPING I COULD GO HOME AND WORK DURING THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS, BUT SINCE I WON'T LEAVE UNTIL DECEMBER 16, THAT'S NOT GOOD. AT LEAST WE DON'T HAVE TO BE BACK UNTIL JANUARY 20, THOUGH!!  THAT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. AARON AND I ARE BOTH GROWING IMPATIENT. I FEEL LIKE I HAVE BEEN TYPING FOR AN HOUR, BUT IT HAS ON;Y BEEN TEN MINUTES. I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL TONIGHT.

AARON IS PLAYING WITH THE MOUSE AND IT IS DRIVING ME CRAZY. NOW HE'S LAUGHING UP A STORM, AND IT IS ALSO DRIVING ME CRAZY. BRANON IS A PERVERT. O, EXCUSE ME, HE THINKS HE'S ROMANTIC. NOW WE'RE ALL LAUGHING AND TALKING ABOUT DON JUAN DEMARCO, WHOEVER HE IS. I AM SO HUNGRY. I HAVEN'T EATEN ALL DAY, AND MY STOMACH FEELS LIKE IT'S GONNA CAVE IN. NOW AARON IS TALKING ABOUT TACO BELL, AND I'M GOING TO VOMIT. I HATE TACO BELL, AS WELL AS ALMOST ALL FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS. NOW AARON IS READING WHAT I AM TYPING, AND IT IS ANNOYING ME. NOT REALLY, ALMOST EVERYTHING HE DOES I THINK IS CUTE. I MISS HIM A LOT, I'M REALLY GLAD HE'S HERE THIS WEEKEND. HE'S FIXING TO MOVE DOWN HERE IN A MONTH, BECAUSE HE'S GRADUATING FROM THE ART INSTITUTE OF DALLAS ON SEPTEMBER 30, THE SAME DAY AS OUR FIRST EXAM. NOW THEY ARE TALKING TALKING ABOUT HOW NASTY UNDERSHIRTS LOOK. IF AARON PICKS AT HIS FOOT ONE MORE TIME I'M GONNA SLAP HIM. NOW MY TIME IS UP, I'M REALLY GLAD. ",1
564,"I have at least forty- thousand different things I have to do and about forty thousand different things going on around me  For one, my parents are out of the country, so it makes everything that much more complicated  second, I have been so busy with my sorority pledge class that I haven't really had time to do homework. just for the record, I feel completely overwhelmed right now. anyway, I went home this weekend just for one night and although it was extremely relaxing, it turned out that it was completely pointless to go because almost my entire family is out of the country. so I go anyway and have a great time just relaxing in my empty house with my dog and the tv, but I forget to bring back with me all my toiletries and makeup  luckily enough for me one of my best friends also went home this weekend and is coming back today, so I had to arrange with her a plan to get my stuff before she leaves that was a total fiasco because as I said before my parents are out of town and the only person who has a key is my aunt but Becky, my friend, doesn't have a car so its just been crazy like that  so I get everything figured out with her but meanwhile my cousin who was house-sitting my house decided to come up to austin so I gave him list of things to bring from home, but we can never find a time when both of us are free so I still haven't gotten my much needed chemistry and calculus notes from high school (or my sunglasses)  its not that big of a deal its just that I really truly need this stuff and the fact that he was so close to my dorm and we never ended seeing each other. oh well I guess he can FedEx the stuff up to me  that way I'll get a package, that is really cool since I don't get any mail anymore. oh and I haven't even mentioned the fact that my computer just does not want to work. no matter how many people play around with it, it still wont work right now I'm using my roommates computer which I have to say is a lot easier to use than mine  I've had a total of I think 4 different guys in to look at my computer, two professional and two of my friends and no one can fix it. the last professional guy is sending someone else tomorrow to look at it because he's ""really good""  at fixing this sort of problem  also he has better tools for the job. its getting really expensive to keep paying these guys to not change my computer  oh well I guess this counts as one of life's unexpected expenses  my parents always warned me about these unexpected incidents that cost a lot of money and I guess they prepared me for it I guess that's why I don't like to spend my own money by writing checks instead I prefer just to charge it to my parents I just wish they wouldn't get mad about it now I'm totally kidding  I have a monthly allowance now and I'm not used to it yet it takes time to adjust right?  overall, I am enjoying college I just have a lot on my mind and a lot to do not that that was any different in high school I was really involved in different organizations and I was in all AP classes so I did get stressed quite easily  I've been meeting a lot of new people of whom I love so far and staying friends with all of my best friends all of my friends live in my dorm so I'm really lucky to be able to experience college with them   ",1
2362,"     I hate walking all over the place at this school. My calves are going to double in size and they already don't fit into boots When I jumped horses I had to buy custom made boots so that my calves could fit into them. My mom has big calves too. Maybe it runs in the family. I don't really now anything else about calves. Weird thing to talk about probably, but mine really hurt right now beacuse of all the walking. It seems like everyplace I have to go is all the way across c ampus. Oh well. walking will probably be good for me. Maybe with all the walking I could loose some weight and make my ex-boyfriend wish that he didn't break up with me. Maybe I'll dye my hair red too. He'd like that. Ha Ha Ha. I think my hair would look good red. I think I should dye it but I hear a lot of people say don't do it. I think I should. Sonce I'm so pale I would like to have some depth. I feel like my blonde hair washes me out. I feel like I'm Hemmingway. Short choppy sentences merely stating what's going on around him. His short choppy sentences had deep meaning though. I wonder if my sentences have any deep meaning. Probably not since I have been talking about calves and hair. So it goes. I think about a lot of things. Sometimes I think so much that I can't fall asleep at night. When that happens I spray some stuff that smell like lavender on my pillows and fall right asleep. Lavender smells so good. I also like that color. It might be my favorite. I don't know because I like really deep eggplant. Yeah. Eggplant it pretty, not a very good looking vegetalbe however. Good color bad vegetable. They don't taste very good either. I don't like many vegetables. I like good that makes you fat. It just tastes better. My mom always yells at me when I eat fatting food. Sometimes when I just eat I get look. I miss my mom. I miss my car. I wish I could go get in my car and blare the stereo and smoke. That would be great. It really gets all the stress out. I love doing that. I miss my car. I also miss my cats, my friends, my ex. When I see happy couples I want to throw rocks at them. I don't but it frustrates me when I see how happy I used to be with another person, but in someone else. Then I start to think of him and I get sad. Oh good this is almost over this was harder than I thought. Trying to type really slows down your thinking. But perhaps I am just a slow typer. I probably should have learned how to properly type when I was a kid. I just didn't think it was important then. They should have a service like maids who come to your house and type stuff for you. Another thing I wish I would have done is learn to play an instrament. There is something so refined about a woman who can play an instrament. There is also something very attractive about a guy who can play something, guitar, piano and whatnot. Very cool. Maybe beacuse they seem more sensative. That is very important. Oh good 30 seconds Yeah!! I have so much more to do tonight. ",0
582,"I just waited 45 minutes for a bus to come and pick me up from the nursing building. in the dark and I got very agitated and edgy. Every car of course had their headlights on and a million cars must have passed by me. I'm still seeing spots even now. I'm upset because I think everyone has forgotten me since I moved off to college. I guess they do. I do feel like a number here at UT despite what they say about getting involved. Every night I come home excited to see if I got any e-mails, messages or mail- but I hardly ever do. They're ALWAYS for my roommate. I still expect to wake up in the morning and see my old room at home, but I get a nasty feeling in my stomach when everything comes into focus and I realize that I'm in some unusual place. and then I realize its my dorm room. Everyone told me the first week would be toughest and that everything is downhill on an easy ride from there. But it isn't working that way for me. Everything is going WAY uphill and the climb is getting even harder than my first week. I want to go home next week and see my family and my dogs, but I know if I do I won't want to come back and it will be even worse than my first day here because I know how awful it can be now and I  will dread that returning again. I'll wait until I get on my feet to go back. Does this page keep moving down?  The phone just rang again and of course it was for my roommate. She has to call her mom when she gets back. Then she'll hog the phone until 12:00 tonight talking to everybody in the world and their dog. And when my mom calls for ME I'll have to call her back because my  roommate will be on the phone and by the time she's off, my mom will be in bed and it would be futile to try and call her back so late. I'm a very SLOW typer. I hope nobody is really reding this because they would think I was an absolute ogre. I'm really not. I put on a good front for other people. Everyone thinks I'm anorexic because they say ""I'm a toothpick"". If only they saw how much I eat. I hate being so skinny and being able to do nothing about it. Everyone wants to be skinny right?  But not to an extreme, right? I have loads of trouble finding clothes, I have to stuff myself till I practically pop at every meal so I don't lose any more weight. I'm sick all of the time, I can't excercise a lot or else I shed pounds and spend too much of my needed energy, my poor parents have to pay a fortune for heart surgery for me because my low weight has caused serious side effects. I've never been anorexic, bolemic or anything for that matter yet people automatically assume that I am. I noticed in that pre-testing, that a lot was aimed toward eating disorders. Yet everyone fails to notice that there are some of us out here who need help with feeling too skinny. How come larger people and insecure people always  get the help, when there's others out here who need some too. WE get tired of doctors shooing us away and finally don't do anything about it until the damage is already done, and it's not like we caused it to be that way like others. I miss my friends. I miss my family, and I'm signing off now because I'm getting really irritated.      ",0
1461,"I am really enjoying myself to a certain point here at UT. I already am homesick and miss my friends and family. I am having a tough time adjusting to life around here. I just got out of Biology class where my teacher barely speaks English. I know I don't like that class, and really dislike the teacher's methods of teaching. I just know I am really going to have to be on my toes in that class. I am meeting new people here which I hardly ever did back home. I still need to make more friends. I already have feelings of loneliness just because I don't have the support here that I do in Dallas. I hope that changes soon. My time at UT may change from four years to one semester if things do not start to look up. Everyone keeps telling me to stick it out and do my best, but I am not even sure I want to be here. Austin is nice, I know that. However, since I don't know anyone, Dallas is better to me. I know my way around there and have a car and know what things I can do around there as far as entertainment. It's a rough adjustment that I will have to deal with, either now or later. That is the only thing keeping me here. I did meet a girl down here that I knew back home but have no idea what to think about that at the moment. I'd like to think that means something, at least meeting her was a big step in branching out, I guess. I dislike my roommate. He spends every minute of life on his computer. He was up last night until 2:00AM while I am trying to sleep. Jester rooms stay pretty lit with one light on so it was hard to sleep. The guy is just hard to live with, yet he never talks unless I talk to him. His friends call the room all the time, including up to 1:00AM, and stop by the room at again 1:00AM. It ticks me off but what am I going to do? I talked to one of my friends back home last night. He has decided to go back to high school and try to finish. He should have graduated last year but dropped out twice in the same year. He has ruined his life with drugs, but at least he is trying to restart. Man twenty minutes is a long time to write As far as my classes go for college, I know I hate Biology. That is definitely my worst subject. I really don't know what to think about psychology. My grades were not that good in high school in psych but I still remember a little of what I was taught. Mythology looks like it could be fun but I have only been to class twice. I have my teaching class tonight so I'll see how that goes. As far as I know, there are few guys in the class. That could be good or bad. Well that's the end of twenty minutes so I'll see how the rest of this class is before I decide if I like it. I do like the writing assignments so far. Hopefully, that will continue. ",1
765,"I really wish that I could get on to the psychology pretesting page to get it over with but I've tried three times and it won't let me on. It's really driving me crazy. I feel like I have so much stuff that I need to get done right know, but if I space it out I can get it done. I need to learn to manage my time a little better. It was easy to do everything at the last minute in high school, but I'm in college know and I need to keep up with my assignments. I'm sure other people are feeling the same as me. If I could get everything done in one day I would feel so relieved, but I have to much to do in one day. My two other friends, live in an apartment, and there so boring. All they do is  sit at home all day and watch TV. I wish that they would go and do something, but if I asked them to do something they would probably do it. But, I just haven't asked. I'm still adjusting to moving. I come from a really small town, of about 2600 people, and I am overwhelmed at the amount of people that are here. I don't know where anything is at and I need to get my driver's license renewed, it has been expired for almost 2 months. One of my other friends goes to Southwestern in Georgetown. She says it is really hard and maybe she will transfer to UT next semester or year. That would be great for me, then I would know someone else here at the school. The chairs in the compurter lab are to close together. You can't move without hitting another chair. They need to spread them out. I want to go out one weekend and do something but I don't know  very many people here and I don't want to impose on anyone and just ask them if I can tag along. They probably would'nt mind. I think I am going to go home this weekend. My mom really gets on my nerves, or she did this past weekend. I  think it was because I was really tired. I really don't like going home because it is really boring and everyone just sits at this store called short stop. What Fun!!!!  I would rather sit at home and watch TV. I want to go and get my hair cut and highlighted and start going to a tanning bed but it always feels like I don't have enough time in the day. I know that I really do I just don't go get it done. I am really tired right know. I went to bed really late last night and had to get up early but I can't take a nap because I need to finish my  homework that I should have already finished. I also have to do my laundry. This chair is really comfortable though. I could fall asleep just sitting here. I hate paying for the copies that I make. I wish I had my own computer in my dorm room so that I wouldn't have to pay for them at all. It's a pain not having your own computer. I had to leave my at home so that my sister could use it if she needed. My parents said I could bring it but I'm in a supplementary room right now and didn't want to. My mailbox doesn't work and neither does our phone jack. I have two roommated, Megan and Maggie. I am supposed to get a check in the mail but it is not here yet and it was mailed on the 23 of August. but I guess it really doesn't matter since I can't get teh mailbox open yeat. I hope that no one else got my check because that would really suck. I could really use the money being here in Austin there is a lot of stuff I could buy. Especialy with all teh stores around here. I really want some khaki pants without the creases in the front and some capri pants. I'm getting tired of doing this but since I have to do it I have to continue writing. Wait, my bad it has been over 20 minutes. I have been writing to long. About 3 minutes to long so I'll be going know. Bye!! ",0
1251,"Well, this is my second writing assignment to try to submit. I tried Monday and Wednesday, Monday it wouldn't even let me on the site, and Wednesday it teased meit let me type the entire stream, and then erased it when I tried to submit it. So, hopefully this one works, because I can't find Microsoft Word on this PC. I wish I could go to sleep because I am so tired. Last night I went to 6th Street and I had blisters on my feet. This morning, I had to get up and go to work. AND MY FEET HURT. I am never going to 6th again, it is hell! I want to go to sleep, but I am here, writing this. At 2:55 I have to go get my Hep shot, yuck. Then I get ready to work the Matchbox 20 concert. I promise that I am going to go to sleep as SOON as I get home and I am not going to get up until I have to go to work on Sunday. Old Navy did not schedule me at all for next week, normally I would be happy, but I am trying to save up for a down payment on a new car!. My boyfriend, of 8 months got a new truck last weekend, and now I am on a kick too I want a Ford Focus. All I do is get on the Internet and look at cars when I should be studying, because my parents said they would only help me with the car if I did well in school. Therefore, I need to concentrate on SCHOOL. I am such a busybee, I need to do a load of laundry before the weekend rush begins. I am sure sometime you lived in a dorm too it is hell trying to do laundry. Bat5hing might b nice, I am sure that when I was on the bus earlier that I STUNK badly. Oh well, the people on the bus didn't smell to hot either. I have a test next week in my Geography class and I need to study for that too. AHHHHHH, college is all about managing your time and not getting behind. (which I am). I should have listened during all of those sessions about how to succeed in school, because I doubt that I am doing very well right now. I really wish that I could go home next weekend because my mom is going to be in the hospital, she has to have a hysterectomy??? I have no clue if I spelled that right. I think that it would be so sweet if I showed up in Houston and brought her flowers and all of that good stuff. I love her so much and if it wasn't for her I don't know what I would have done. I guess this weekend I will go buy her a card and prepare to go home this weekend. I know that I might not get an hours next week, but that is OK, because I really don't need any money anyway, like I said, I am trying to save up for a new car. Right now I don't have anything going through my mind other than. SLEEP, and food. And a shower, all of the necessities of life. Well my twenty minutes is almost up, only four minutes to go. I am such a slow typist. I hope this concert is worth all of the work, because I am dead tired. I probably should be going to sleep instead of going to the concert but, oh well. It is a great opportunity to see the show for a little work. I am sure that makes sense to anyone, right? My room is such a mess, my roommate and I really need to clean it. Unfortunately, my twenty minutes are up, and I am going to go to BED!  ",1
220,"I have to work at 1pm, go back to my dorm, and get everything organized I still have to do my geology homework and study that since science is hard for me. I need to go shopping for food also and get my internet connection set up. I hope my dad can help me because if not I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t know when I will ever get on the net and all my assignments are due over it. I also need to call my Brad in College Station. I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t know what to do in that situation. I think I love him but I need to date others--but who to date? I am not interested in anyone I only want to know for sure if it is Brad I want but how do I know if he really wants me when we go to such different schools and he will probably find an aggie woman I could find a longhorn man also . the guy I just met is pretty cool but I don't see me dating him maybe I should just have fun and see what happens no need to get serious yet-- unlike Lori and I do not want to be like her and Ryan. I am glad I didnÃ¯Â¿Â½t have to quit my job I love everyone there only my manager is driving me crazy with the shifts I am getting hopefully it will all work out but I have to work 2 shifts today and I still have so much to do I just need to relax or something but I cant until I get all my stuff done. oh well I wish I had time to tell my mom and dad everything that is going on here but things keep coming up people are always calling and or dropping by and there is no time to call unless it is at midnight when they have been asleep for hours its funny because you would think that since we live in the same city I would be able to talk easily but I cant tomorrow is labor day I wonder if Jeff will want to do any thing he probably will and I don't know if I have time or not to spend the day with him and if I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t he will probably throw a fit since he lives in san marcos but he can come home all the time if he wants or I can visit him I wish he wasnÃ¯Â¿Â½t so needy he has to really we are not together but he has always been like this that is why we could never work out not like brad though he is wonderful but he wrote me some letter I havenÃ¯Â¿Â½t gotten it yet and he says parts of it are sad and parts happy I wonder is it good sad like he misses me or bad sad like he met someone else I will find out in the next few days  I wonder if Ryan got my letter and how he is doing I wonder how mecredy is doing and when he is going back to Dallas the George strait concert was great I wonder is they got to see brad I wonder how Lori is I havenÃ¯Â¿Â½t talked to her in a couple of days and we have to do the draw together on Tuesday I hope she can stand in line with me and I may have to leave early since I work at 10:30 I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t know the games are going to be great I hope I get to go to the A&m game! I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t think I want to hang out with brad that weekend though I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t know it depends on him and who knows if I'll get tickets I really want to go though Tyler already has some lined up I wonder how you get to college Station I'm sure someone will give me directions I hope it isnÃ¯Â¿Â½t too scary I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t know what I would wear I wonder whose car we could take mine would never make it and it has UT stickers all over so they would trash it ",1
632,"I really miss my home town, but only because I'm not comfortable in my new surroundings. my friends seem short- lived and artificial, and my classes seem all too real and incredibly healthy. I'm constantly worrying that I'll fail and I seem to be hanging out with my thoughts too much, sometimes I feel they are a bad influence on me. I'm only happy when I'm doing something, and people tell me it's because I don't like to deal with my problems. it's true, but at this time I don't care. I have a hard time concentrating, sometimes I wonder if I have ADD. I probably don't , but I like to think I do. they call that a hypochondriac right? I have a question: does  believing you are a hypochondriac mean that you are suffering from something else? I hope so, petty mental problems are better that physical problems. ",1
867,"Being at cllege is a new experience for me and I think that it is giving me  a sence of being dependant on myself. I like all the new freedom that I have  gotten, but I also am homesick a lot. I miss my parents and being in my house  in Houston. There isn't anyone to make sure that I do everything that I am  supposed to do. I am a person that does not get stressed out a lot, ut now that       I am in college and having to take care of everything on my own, I am  getting worried and that is gettting me scared. I have a lot of thing s that I  need to get accomplished and don't have time for it. It makes me very  frustrated and annoyed at the same time. I feel like I should be a lot more  organized and up to date with everything. I am a very organized person, even a  ""neat feak,"" and that is why it's driving me crazy when I am behind. I think  that if I work hard, then I will do alright.       Last weekend, I went home and visited my friends and family and it felt so  good to be home. I was able to go driving around and I knew where everything   was, and that feeling of being in control was great. think that I just need  time to settle into UT, and then I will be in more control. Austin is never  going to be ""home"" for me, but it will be a place that I can come to enjoy. I  don't think that any city can compare to Houston because that is where I grew up  and that's also where I have all of my family and friends.       Sometimes I think about how life would be like if I was adopted or even if  one or both of my parents were dead. I look back and don't think that I could  manage. My parents play a very important role in my life and I don't think that  I would be the same person that I am without them. I know a lot of people that  have parents that have passed away and they have really gone through some rough  times and they are doing well now, and I give them so much strenght and poer for  being able to do that. If my mother would pass on, I think that I would really  go into a state of depression, and would go trough a transformation, in that I  would become very quiet when usually I am very outgoing and lively. Many things  don't affect me unless they are very close and dear to my heart. I usually  don't cry in movies, and I don't care to become very emotional all the time. I  have too much pride to cry infront of people other than my family. No matter  how depressing the news, I am unable to show my emotions. That is something  that I think that I get from my parents, specifically my mother. I think that I  have gotten a lot of my qualities from my mother and most of my physical  qualities from my father. I think that I am able to be the person that I am  because of my parents. They helped shape me into the person that I am.       There are friends that I have been close to in high school, and ever since  I have come to UT, I have not been as close to. I don't know the reason for the  change, other than the fact that our schedules are conflicting and that we have  not tried as hard to keep in touch. I have heard that things like this happen  and that you make all of your really good friends in college. I know what  people say, but I have a really good friend at Trinity and me and her have keep  in touch really well. I think that she is an exception to the ""rule. ""                               ",1
1441,"I am so stressed out right now I don't even know what to do. If it's not one thing it's another. Everything seems to be coming at me all at once and there is no escape. I'm trapped. I have so much inside that I want to let out, and sometimes I don't know what to do with myself. There are just too many pressures. Sometimes I wish I could ignore all the pressures and just have fun and everything would still be okay. But it wouldn't be. Sadly, I'm stuck with all of these barriers that keep me from being who I really want to be. I wish I could just be Mary all of the time. But, it's impossible. I'm always too worried about everything, but I think you're better off worrying than just not caring at all. I always seem to look at many things in a different perspective than most people. I also find it hard to express those perspectives. Most people just don't care, but I seem to fret over everything. Maybe I'm obsessive, I don't know! But to top it off, I'm pretty happy where I am today. I guess all the fretting over tests and exams in the past got me where I am today. I can't believe how some people really are. Some people I know are on so much alcohol or drugs, that that's all they think about, and forget about life and forget about their dreams. They let their life pass them by, and before they know it they'll be a big nobody in the world. I don't want to waste my lifetime like that. While I'm still young I want to take so much advantage of the opportunities that I have. I would love to contribute to the world and be the best person I can possibly be. I don't care what anyone says or thinks about me. I know the truth, and no one can judge me accept God. I want to be able to smile at the world and the world to just smile back. But the world is not that nice. It is such a mean, ugly world that sometimes I wish I didn't live in it. But the world can also be a magnificent thing to experience. There's just so much you can do, but it feels like so little time. Sometimes I'm scared that there won't be enough time to do whatever it is that I want to do. A friend once told me to do at least one thing a day that scares you. I like that advice. There's so much inside of me that I want to explode! And I wonder if this feeling will disappear with age. Well, I certainly hope not. I want to be 85 and feel like I'm still 15. A lot of times I wish I were 3 or 4 again with no worries or responsibilities. I believe being around that age was the best time of my life. I had no real care in the world. I was too confused to. I had no idea I actually existed in the outside worldI just was. Well, I could go on forever but I got things to do. I kind of like this assignment. It's neat. Well, I don't want to bore you or anything, and I think my 20 minutes is up! So, it was nice chatting with you Dr. P! ",1
962,"My thoughts are all jumbled right now. My life is so different now than it was 2 months ago. I had no idea that leaving home and beginning a life on my own would change me so much. For years now, I've anticipated this change in my life. I've so wanted to be on my own. not because there's anything wrong with my life at home, but because I've always been an independent person. i've always felt I needed to do things for myself. take care of myself. not be such a burden. Today. tons of things have gone through my mind. Most of the day. it has been sleep. I love Saturdays. i love to sleep and not have to worry about getting up to do anything. But. at times. i think about home. the things I'm missing. and the things they're missing about me. I think about my little brother. and how I'm missing him grow up. I know I've only been gone for three weeks, but he has changed in my eyes so much in those three weeks. I think about the birthdays I'm missing because I just can't make it home every weekend. And I think about my friends. my best friend, Amber. how I miss talking to her about EVERYTHING. How I wish she were here to experience all the stuff that I'm experiencing right now. I think a lot about my ""boyfriend"". i put it in quotes because we're not exclusive anymore. we're ""dating other people"". i think about how much I miss him. his eyes. his laugh. his attention. But today when I woke up, the first thoughts that came to my head was. Nikki, you have two papers to write for Psychology. better get it done. Nikki, you have to mail you're grandmother a birthday card. you're going to miss her birthday this year. Nikki, you have to mail your paycheck home so Mom can deposit it for you. Nikki, you have no money left from that paycheck. so STOP SPENDING. Life is so different for me now. i've got so much to think about everyday. like I haven't done laundry in a week and a half. and I'm running out of clothes. i have to get that done too. At times, I miss having my mom there to remind me of everything. to tell me to do stuff. but at times, I don't miss that. i'm glad I'm getting things done without having to be told. I think about other stuff too. like. where am I going to live next year?. am I going to be friends with the same people?  I've been so lucky up to this point. i've got the greatest friends. they'd do anything for me and each other. I love them. and I've only known them for three weeks. I've got to think about work too. how different it is from work at home. how there are just those days when I just don't want to go. and how I'm so glad that I get a break today and don't have to go in. Don't get me wrong. i love my job. it's just. i feel overwhelmed at times. My friends are going this way. and that way. and none of them have jobs. when I'm working almost every weeknight. Sometimes I feel deprived. of there time. of my own time. but then I remember that I am now a responsible adult. and I am doing things for myself. I have to find a church down here in Austin, too. I've never had the experience of doing that before. i've always been a member of the same church. always been around the same people. coming from a small town, that happens. But God is a big part of my life. and I've got to find a church. i worry about that a lot. It's something new for me. and I'm scared. Right now. i'm thinking about how cold it is in this stupid room. and how it didn't do me any good to shave my legs. oh, and how cold it's going to be this winter. so glad I bought a down comforter. Well. that's about all I'm thinking about lately. so I guess this brings my paper to an end. Thanks for listening. ",1
2207,"Seriously in my mind right now I have so many levels of thought that I can easily access by simply starting to think about something, Everything runs in these little spurts of thought but once I analyze them long enough they are all working together to form what I think is the cycle of my mind and it all works together simultaneously and perfect as the world is, because everything has its specific purpose. A lot of things that I thought before were just meaningless pieces of metal and serve no purpose in the world are really there for means of our (human) use and that is what they are specifically there for. Everything is for us. Humans. Everything. We utilize this world as it is our lemon and we must make as much lemonade for ourselves as we possibly can. This alternates from being a very good and positive thing to being a terrible and selfish thing that makes us thing that we all must worry about ourselves and no one else matters unless they are aiding us on our rise to the top of the pitcher of our own lemonade, making sure that on one takes any along the way. If someone takes our lemonade, we must simply acknowledge its loss and move on but how much is too much? When and where is the point where the lemonade that is taken is too much and we need it back? But if someone drinks it then we can't get it back, so how much lemonade do we personally owe to others if we are making much more lemonade than they are? Notice please that this lemonade is still very much so a metaphor for what we provide for this world that works specifically for us. Even the controversy in the world is there specifically to get others to be mentally in touch with ourselves and make sure that they know our way of thinking. Controversy evolves from people trying to get other people to think the way that they do. Basically, this is important in deciding which factors of society are more acceptable among a large number of people instead of just one person. The more people widely accept a thought, the more it is thought to be what we think as ""normal"" but just because a thought isn't in everyone's mind, then why do we think it is abnormal or crazy? In our minds, social situations and experiences have led most to believe that minor variations in behavior are ""weird"" but this is the main problem with our world. If everyone could just accept everyone for the way they are then no one will be right or wrong and the only controversy will be because. well there will be no controversy if everyone stops being so damn judgmental all the time, please pardon my language but I felt I must stress the importance of the statement. May I please stress it again? Damn, There I did it. There is a flaw in our perfect world and if people are wondering why they may be unhappy that is probably why. They must accept everything for the way that it is and do their best to utilize what they can without being selfish and they must utilize the time that they have in order to make their life the best that it can be. People that are typically unhappy and depressed tend to think that the world needs to be changed but if they stopped thinking like that then they would be happy with the world the way it is and they would no longer be depressed. I see the irony in my statements above because I said simply that we must accept the world for what it is, but here's the thing. I have personally not yet learned to do this because I still see the flaws of judge mentality in our world that I wish to change or eradicate: the fact that people don't just accept the world and people in their ""out of the ordinary"" state of minds for just the way that it is. Simply put. the way that it is. THE WAY THAT IT IS. If I could understand that then I believe that I will have reached a level of happiness that no one could reach. I am actually much closer to this state of bliss and happiness than I ever thought I could be. I don't think there are any major flaws in our world that I cannot look at with an open mind and. accept, if you will. I say ""if you will"" because I feel that ""accept"" may not properly convey what it is that I am trying to express. By accept, I mean. look at something with an inner peace and happiness that yes it exists and it must but why? well who knows and it is okay not to know. I need not know the meaning of everything but I have a deep appreciation for it. There it is. I HAVE A DEEP APPRECIATION FOR IT. I was trying to find the phrase that conveyed my sight of the world. I appreciate the beauty of the world and the diversity among people's personalities and I choose to embrace everyone not hoping that they will change but hoping that they will continue to open the door that is my mind. No one can say they appreciate this until they really feel it. I feel it with everything that I do and I only hope that everyone can at one point or another feel this appreciation for people and not to mention mere intimate objects produced by either nature or a human being himself. Everything is there for our pleasure and we must utilize it to our best capabilities (without bearing harm to others of course, because that is the definite point where a specific line is crossed), and this is simply our duty to the world.

84,"Well, I'm not really sure what types of things I'm supposed to be saying. I miss my boyfriend so much. I hope he has a safe trip home. I hope he doesn't fall asleep. I feel really sleepy myself. I hope I can stay awake for this twenty minutes. Time seems to go by so slowly when you're sleepy. Especially when school work is involved. I wish I was a better typer. It is so hard to just think normally when you're typing on a computer. People probably think I'm not a very interesting person. I try to be, but I think I was born to be boring. Be boring and study my life away. I really don't mean to be so studious. I mean I want to do well in school, but I think I'm too caught up in it. Everything makes me nervous. It is so strange because even though I know this isn't going to be ""graded"", I feel nervous about doing it wrong or not doing a good job. I miss my family and my friends. I don't think I appreciated them enough when I was home. It is so hard to build a friendship up from scratch. It took years to be so close to them, and now I have to start all over. I'm truly lucky to have people that share all of my memories and understand all of my feelings. I wonder if they miss me as much as I miss them. I'm so paranoid. I'm always concerned that people are deceiving me in relationships. What if they don't mean ""love"" in the same way that I do?  I hate being hurt. I like to be in control and be omniscient. I like to have the upper hand with people. Unfortunately,  I think most of the time I'm the vulnerable one. Is that normal?  Probably. If I tell myself that enough I might believe it. Could someone really love someone enough that they would die for them if they had to. So many songs make that claim. It must be a truly amazing love. I am still in awe when I think about what Jesus did for me and everyone else. He died a most humiliating and painful death so we wouldn't have to. What love!  How sad though to think that not everyone accepts it!  I feel so guilty when talking to someone that doesn't accept it. I feel like there is something I could say to solve it, but I just don't know what. I know I'm not doing everything I could for Christ, and therefore not being quite good enough. I know I can't be perfect, but I try so hard to be. It feels that I come up short a lot in my life. It is so stressful. I'm probably going to die at an early age because of it. I can't stop though. Kale is so wonderful. He would do anything for me. I can't imagine anyone loving me that much unless they have to. My parents have to, but he doesn't. It is amazing. ",1
1422,"I guess that I should start by telling you where I am. I am in my dorm room at Castilian. I only had one class today, Calculus. I don't really like Calculus that much. But it hasn't been too bad so far. I want to call my old band director and tell him good luck tonight. Tonight is their first football game and they are playing the Astrodome. I got to play in the Astrodome once. It was really cool. At first I was really envious of my friends still in high school because they were going to get to play there again. But then I realized that I was going to get to play at the UT Stadium and at many other great stadiums across the country throughout my time here at UT. My roommate is playing a video game now and I'd really rather be doing that. Not because I dislike this assignment, but because I haven't gotten to play any games in a long time. School and band are taking up a lot of my time. But I think that is good. I like to stay busy. Last year in high school I was in band, jazz band, choir, pop choir, mock trial, KEY club, a little student council, and track. I had a great time and was doing stuff constantly. I would like to have that kind of life here. I think that I would like to join a fraternity, Longhorn Singers, a Bible Study group, mock trial, and anything else I can find time for. I like being a part of many different things. That way I can have friends from all over and with many different interests. UT has been very interesting so far. I love the way my schedule works. I am through with my classes today and it is only 12:45 (The day by the way is Friday if anybody is actually reading this). I think that I would like for somebody to read this even though it isn't the most exciting paper in the world. At least then I wouldn't have written it just see how accurately I type. Anyways, I'm not sure what I should be writing about. Uhhhh. My parents are going to be here tonight. They are coming up here (or over here technically) to watch me march at my first college football game. My mom is really excited. My dad is also but he is also coming to see the game. My mom could careless about the game. All right! Only 3 more minutes. Uhhh. I have a really nice view of the city from my room. It's on the twentyfirst floor. It really sucks trying to get up here on an elevator though. And it's really hard trying to find a place to practice my trumpet in a dorm. I tried the roof but it was locked. I'm really hungry now and that's good because I only have about thirty more seconds to type. Yaady yaady yaady and now I'm done. I am going to go eat. Thank you to whoever has read this. And if nobody has or ever will, there isn't much that I can do about it. ",1
2002,"Right now I am watching tv. I it kinda hard to type with these nails, I don't think I have had to type a large amount since I got them. The commercials on tv are so stupid, especially the ones for women's health. I need to get my nails filled, but I don't think I am going to spend the money on it, there are more important things that I can spend my money on. I would be nice if I had a newer computer, this one gets the job done though. I just don't know how reliable, because my sister had all kinds of stuff on it when it was hers, and as a result it on its third hard drive. Last year at the beginning of the year, my computer crashed. that wasn't too much fun, because I had all those assignments to turn in and no computer. I is amazing how you can take technology like that for granted, and how limited you feel once it isn't there anymore. Everything seems so materialistic, but I must admit that I am just as materialistic as anybody else. Where my keyboard is isn't very comfortable for typing. Got that book for my sister. That is so weird how her teacher died so suddenly right before school starts. mom said that he had a nine year old and a five year old. That must be so hard. It seems weird that now his wife will be the one teaching the class. I guess she has some kind of degree related to psychology as well. Maybe that is how she and her late husband met. Mom's birthday is on Friday. I need to get a card for her, and I need to get a card for Luis. I can't forget that when I go to the store tonight. Hopefully that won't take up too much time, because I have a lot of reading I need to do and write notes over what I read. It is frustrating, because I am always reading and doing homework, yet I constantly seem behind. I guess I have just never taken this many reading classes at once before. That sucks though, because then I will have to take several sciences at once too, and that will be just as hard. It is hard to get that balance, esp. when you are a transfer student and are trying to figure out how everything transfers. I wish I could have gotten an appointment with that advisor at the health science center sooner. you would think that they would have more than one advisor, especially since she will or has been out for at least a month. I hope that someone from Health south will call me back, if not I will call again since I just got an answering machine and had to leave a message. I would really like to start working again, especially because I need more hours. Well technically I have enough to apply for PT school, but most people have worked there for at least a year, if not more. Some of then have been there for three years. Luis and Eli had been there for a year and a half or something like that. Well Eli isn't working there, because he is starting PT school. I wonder how different the rehabilitation hospital is here compared to the one in San Antonio. I don't think waking up at 6:30 to get to work on time will be too much fun, especially now that I am in school, but I guess I just have to wait and see if they even have any open positions. I don't really like not having a job, I like the security of know I have some sort of income, even if it isn't a lot. Of course, I think school would be less stressful without a job, but I know I could handle it if I had one. Okay I am at somewhere around 15 minutes. five minutes to go. well not anymore since I typed that. Man I haven't been typing too fast, I guess that doesn't really matter. hey there is a card commercial. I should put the stuff I need from the store on a post it. I think I have some stuff written somewhere, I usually have random post its with reminders. I know I have one for the stuff I need to get at home this weekend, but I'm not sure about the store. I'll look after I am done with this. Okay what next. I wish I could type as fast what I can think. I forget half of what I am thinking by the time I write down the first thought. One minute left. I wonder what causes me to get headaches practically everyday. Maybe I should go to the doctor sometime. It could be what I eat, maybe I am allergic to something, or just not eating right. Time's up, I guess this is it. ",1
782,"Ok. I've never done this before, so here it goes. I've just come back from houston and I ams so glad that I'm here. I miss the turtles. you know. the ones that are in the pond that';s in the midding of nowhere. anyway. I got back here. and did my laundry. I borrowed quarters. and found out I have a million pennies. That and big bills. I'm hungry but not really hungry. it's wierd. I live at doby and somehow when I eat. it's like this feeling that I'm not that hungry and that I don't need to eat. but once I'm in my room. I'm like a starving maniac. I don't know. I miss my boyfriend. Sometimes I feel lonely here. I mean, I'm not really lonely because of all the friends I met here. especially my roommate. she's really nice. if shere weren't here. then I would be so bored out of my mind. I think what takes my time is actually just watching a lot of tv. I've gotten used to watching daily soaps. can you believe that? I never watch soaps. and then I get on the net and check my nonexistant mail. and eat and sleep. I study at nights. I really am hoping that I do well here. I really need tobecause I thing I slacked off so much my senior year. I've got to do well. I promised myself and my parents. how can you write so much. my brain is totally wearing off. I decided to do this because I have a lack of want to study anymore and I know I can't put this off any longer. it's just something I have to do. I need to make sure that whatever essay I get that I'll try to get it done asap and not be a procrastinator like I am always. well, I went home and wanted to see my goddaughter. but my friends changed their number again. and somehow they forgot to reach me. and I'm so upset because I don't know when I'll see them again. this tiem I took a car. my friend drove the car. it's so much more comfortable than the greyhound. what's bad about it is that you have to worry about a ride to the greyhound. I still don't think I can find my way around just by the bus. it would be so much eaiser if I had a car. so much easier. god, I don't know why I sold that car. well. jason and I would bne fighting over it anyway. he's my brother. That is if he'll get off the computer trying to email his girlfriend all the time. I'm sure he will run out of things to say. nevermind. I'm washing my laundry. and got. that pounding. next door is giving a headache. he pounds that music all the time. like all the time. until 2 in the morning. and I don't know how I deal with it. and yet we're friends. yess. I only have another 7 minutes to go. this is taking too long. way too long. the daily thing I do is thing about my boyfriend. he said that he's be here. and I trust him on that. but he's transfering from california and needs to taek the tasp. I wish he were here. he can't talk to me often cause he lives with  his sister. and she dosn't like me. but I have no idea why. I'm such a good girl. I mean that. I do nothing wrong. I'm thinking of rushing. to rush and not join. isn't that twisted. I hear everyone does that. just to go to the parites. and meet the ppl. my boyfriend would be so jealous though. I can't tell him in any way. I think he still does not trust me thought he says he does. my room mate is lucky. she saw her kinda boyfriend. though he didn't spend just time with  her. but time with  his friends too. this is so hard. I think time is coming to an end. it should. ok. it's there. bye. I'm just kidding. I wish it were. ok. done. ",1
2082,"Rather than sitting at a blank computer screen right now, I am sitting in the hallway outside my dorm room. You see, my roommate Carly is sleeping. She was fortunate to have no classes on friday. I on the other hand, have chemistry on friday mornings at 10. You understand the peril it takes to get out of bed on fridays when she can sleep away, often until long after I return. As is the case today, which is why I am still in the hallway so as to not disturb her sleep. It's not that I need to sleep right now, it's the idea behind it--she sleeping while I am up and writing this paper. This paper by the way is the first of two papers I have been blessed to right today. This writing assignment is fun; it's pretty interesting to see where your mind will go in a matter of a few minutes or seconds. One word or thought will take you in a completely new and most of the time, very different direction. Back to the second paper I'll be writing today. My ethics in nursing class has a paper due next thursday. We meet twice a week, one on tuesdays and once on thursdays. It is quite a walk to the nursing building. It is located at the far end of campus, so much so that often times it is omitted from maps of campus. But, I enjoy the class so the walk is manageable. Ahh, all these pop ups keep coming while I am writing this. I really don't like the idea of pop ups. Back to my paper. We discuss some pretty controversial subjects in the ethics class, all in preparation for the nursing field. It's hard to think of everything that we will one day face. That is, if we actually get accepted into the nursing program. It's pretty tough I believe. They don't accept everyone which leans its way to be a competitive program. I hope I get accepted. It seems to be the direction that God is pointing my towards. I don't now though; I think  I need to have a couple more talks with him to see where He wants me and  where I might serve him best. Well, I'm approaching the end of this writing assignment activity. So without further adew(I don't really know how to    spell that word, but go with me on it) this will end my first writing assignment for psychology. I sure hope I accomplished the task at hand. It seemed easy enough. but I guess we'll see. My phone is ringing. I bet it is Sterling. ",1
109,"Well this is it , I guess?  My first writing assignment in Psychology. I sure hope that no one calls and interrupts my internet access. Watch!  Now that I've said that, someone will probably call. I'm the type of person that thinks that way. I mean, that if I say that I don't want something to happen, then I think that it probably will. The thing is, that those negative things that I think will happen seldom do. I guess I am just a cynical person like that. Wait, is that cynical or pessimistic?  I don't know!  Maybe I just think that way because I think it's humorous, or maybe I'm just trying to keep myself in check. Whatever it is, I just think that way sometimes. Enough about that. There sure are a lot  of fine women here at UT. Well. Maybe it's because I went to an all boy school for four years that I think that way. No, that's not it. These girls would look good regardless of where I went to high school. The good thing is that there are a lot of girls, the bad thing is that I havenÃ¯Â¿Â½t met one yet. I have always been shy around girls and going to an all-boy high school didn't help anything. Well, I will say it right here!  I am going to do my best to get over that. With all these girls, I just can't let them pass me by. I see how happy my roommate and friend is with his girlfriend. I also hear countless stories of all these ""fine"" girls that he has met. I want to be the one with the stories and the girl. Not that I want  my friend to not have the stories and the girl, but I want those things, too. Heartbreaking story:  there is this real ""fly"" Asian girl in my Chemistry class. On the first day, she sat right next to me!  Then I don't see here for a couple of days. Today I see her, finally!  And she's holding some dude's hand!  Oh well, I guess?!? There's an addiction that I must get over. Not drugs, or alcohol, or anything bad like that. You see, I love to play at the local arcade. I must spend about two dollars every other day in there. My money isn't limitless and everytime I put a quarter into the arcade machine, then that's one less load of laundry that I can do. Now do I want 20 minutes of entertainment or clean clothes. I don't know. It seems that every free moment I have I am in that stupid arcade. A tie-in with the last paragraph: maybe I don't meet any girls because I am in the arcade all the time. Prediction:  I get out of the arcade, I take on an outgoing attitude, and I will meet a girl. Before I finish with this writing assignment, let me tell you about the two addictions that I have that I don't really care to get rid of. I love the Simpsons, and hip-hop. There's something about both of those that I just find pure joy in. In both cases, I see, here, and enjoy things that most people don't. It seems that the more obscure or ""hidden"" the things that I find enjoyment, the more joy I find in it. I guess it's that I am such a fan of both that the ordinary just isn't quite good enough. That's sort of bad. I should just enjoy the Simpsons and hip-hop for what they are and stop looking for the obscure. Well, this wasnÃ¯Â¿Â½t so bad. With this  being the first assignment, I guess I'll see you( the psychology web-page) tomorrow . ",1
354,"However, I feel I could be falling into a trap that could severely effect my grades. My roommate is a friend from high school and unfortunately for me he likes to stay out very late. I have early classes and it is starting to take a toll on me. It doesn't seem as if there is enough time in a day. I am looking forward to playing club volleyball here and I really enjoy the coach. Volleyball is by far my favorite sport. I need to start asking some girls I have met out on dates. I am enrolled in a dancing class with one of my girlfriends and I am having a lot of fun with it. My parents are coming up to see me tomorrow and will be bringing my bicycle with them. It is funny, I love my parents very much but I really don't miss them. I don't have a desire to go home any time soon. My suitemates are having friends stay the night and I hope that they will not be too noisy. After the football game tonight I think I will do some homework and go to bed. I am looking forward to this psychology class. I find it very interesting so far. I need to be sure to keep up in my reading. ",1
1376,"Well, the twenty minutes start now. It feels strange having to write out what I am thinking. Seeing as how I've never had a diary or journal, I've never had to do this before. Funny how your mind draws a blank when you are supposed to be writing what you are thinking at that very instant. A whole minute has gone by and I can not think of anything to type. I guess that's kind of the purpose. don't think ahead for once, just let everything come out just as quickly as it comes in. all day long, my mind has been jumbled up with. well, stuff, and now I can't seem to remember what all the ""stuff"" was. Gosh, it's early and I'm already tired. It's not that today was stressful, just very hot and tiring. I can't wait until the weather finally cools off. I wish I could sleep in tomorrow. I wish I could go to sleep now. I hope what I actually write isn't important. After all, it's only a completion grade, right? I hope so. Sigh. Now that I'm thinking about it, this class kind of worries me, after 5 class days in here, I'm still not sure what to study or what to write down in my notes, the TA at the supplemental instructions class, I can't remember her name at the moment, says that we should pay attention to the book and the notes. But I think we wanted a more concise answer. My philosophy class is exactly the same. No body knows what to write in their notes, after all, all the notes we take are basically made up of questions. I'm a bit nervous about my first test in that class. And we are only going to have three, and that's counting the final. It has its good and bad points I guess. Double standard. Since I've started college, it seems like everything is a double standard. I don't live on campus that has its good and bad points. Umm, what else? Lots of things. hard to come with them right now. Dang, I still have to read for my writing class. ugh, that book is boring, I hope I don't fall asleep reading it again. More than likely I will seeing as how I'm sleepy right now. I think I should just read tomorrow while I'm on the shuttle to school. That'd be good. Oh, I can't. I have to get on the early bus tomorrow, it's going be too packed to be able to concentrate. Guess I have to read tonight. Oh well. Gosh, I'm tired. Wait. My mom always calls when I'm in the middle of something. Weird. Why did she need my schedule? I bet so she could call when she knows I'm not in class. I know this sounds bad, but I don't want to talk to her everyday. Every time she calls, she sounds like she's upset with me. I think she's mad because I left home. But it's not like I went out of the country, or out of state for that matter. I'm only 3 hours away, and I'm going home this weekend to visit anyway. She doesn't have reason to be upset with me. She's supposed to happy and proud. It was always hard to make her proud. Nothing ever seemed good enough for her. But not my dad, he's different. As long as I tried, my dad was always proud of me; I love him for that. Well, there goes my timer. 20 minutes is up. Thank you. ",1
2190,"Sorry for any grammar mistakes in this timed writing. There's a bit of pressure writing every thought you have within 20 minutes and try and make it completely coherent. The music in the back ground plays that of falling falling falling. Then hits a note as if the journey of which it began will continue. Adversaries in between as if rapids in the path. The sun glares in as it goes lower in the sky. Now at this hour of the day is when my apartment is the warmest. The light carries in like the rays dance and shuffle past the leaves of the tree outside. I watch my friends sit next to me. One is a zombie slasher with a chain saw for an arm, the other sits and types quietly. The music is quieter now with bell like rings in it. The bass has a slow but progressive sound to it. The guitar sings about as the music moves on. Over the middle window, the one with the blinds shut, we keep the blue mask. It has sharp looking teeth which are yellow. The teeth match the horns. I'm now half past the time of when I started. Some pauses have been taken in between sentences or paragraphs. Sorry for the time of which I slacked. I loosing ideas of what to write now. I have little more to to tell of my surroundings more. The music is now more of a popping sounds. It also mud     like sounding guitar now. My phone is ringing now but I got my friend to pick it up. I will call them back. This is now the end. ",0
829,"Twenty minutes seems long, I wonder what the footbal game will be like. I miss my best friend. I'm glad to be going home next weekend. My own bed. It is lonely when no one is around me. WOnder what my roomate is doing? Why is my floor so quiet right now? I'm glad I don't want to be around anyone right now. I hope clubbing is fun tonight because I do not want to spend my entire year just sitting in Jester. WOnder if I'll transfer next year? I hope I get into the busines school, but at the same time if I don't I have an excuse to leave Texas. I miss Connecticut. Autum wil come soon, why are there no decent trees in Texas? I hate the heat and the desert and the southern accents. I just want to be back in my comfortable bed in Connecticut not in Plano texas. I know I must be upset because I could barely eat at lunch. Why has no one called me today? I call people every day and leave messages, even my parents have more of a life right now. Oh, this is my favorite part of this song. I am gald I decided to put on Dave Matthews while I did this. I wonder if my cats miss me? I bet they miss onnecticut too. I hope I meet some hot guys tonight, that are actually interested in me for once. I hope that my new found friends aren't too good at dancing because I suck and I don't want to look like this awkward fool with my friends dancing amazingly. I am praying that I don't end up grinding with some sketchy boy like last time with out even knowing it. I do not want to feel the penis's of random guys, hey just call me old fashioned but I like to know a guys name, maybe his major. Now I am getting too worried about the thing maybe I should stay at home. No, I will not do this to myself again, I can't this is completely ridiculous. Just because I don't know these people too well doesn't mean that I can hide from the world. how am I going to get know these people better if I don't go and do these things. IHOP was fun last night and I tought it wouldn't be. I am glad I got to sit on the end because everyone else in the middle seemed so squished. I think that I am loosing weight, I should be because I have been eationg a lot less since I have been here. No snacking for me!!! Plus I walk so mcuh. that's cool no freshman 15. But I could do with out the heat. That seems like a little too much for me. It never was that hot in Connecticut. Okay, maybe, but I just miss it up there. All my friends, even though they are at college. I wish it was senior year again. Everything was so much less complicated then. Now I feel as though I will never have everything that I did there. I tried to appreciate it all when I had it, but I didn't appreciate it enough. I had so much and even though I still have the memories I miss it all so much. I know it won't be the same when I go back, but I miss the security that I felt there. I know that this is a learning and growth ex[erience but I do not want to have all this growth I happy with myself and what I was and don't want to change. Maybe if I am lucky I'll be able to graduate in three years. I already have sophomore standing thanks to my wonder ful teachers. I miss Mrs. Jestin and even Dr. Dennis. Why can't I just adjust and love everything? well I guess I just have to keep on doing what I am doing and that is that. all I know is that I will never forget what I left behind. ",1
290,My Thoughts. As I sit here thinking my mind wonders into so many different plains of emotion and depth. I like the music I am listening to but my concentration is probably dying. I hate typing. This is a great way to see how I am thinking although I am tired and my thoughts are probably greatly distorted. I am glad I came to college station last night. It feels good to be back here and to see all these people I know already. I am already tired of seeing people it is almost impossible to get to know. My roommate is probably sitting at my apartment all alone and that is too bad I wish she had something to do as well. I like her but we do have some crazy differences. I am extremely thirsty. It is very hot in here. The past few days have been so terribly hot outside. I like the Fall and the Winter better. Everything is a lot more enjoyable then. I cant wait to see my old friends when I go home during Christmas. In High School I always thought I was Different from everyone else and to an extent I was. I hate yellow. I like to write but I would rather be reading a good book right now or maybe going to play put-put golf. Twenty minutes is a long time to write about nothing. Charlie has gone to work and I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t have much to do now other than this. Why do people act so stupid today. I am scared to meet people because they all seem so strange and their thoughts all seem to be the opposite of mine. I want to breathe a breath that is new. I see nothing as far as my life is right now. I live my life with the shadows and I know that this is wrong or is it . I will find a place I have before. My head hurts what else can I write oh sweet brain. I love psychology it is so exciting and new and apparent . I am going to enjoy  this class even though is has about a billion people in it and that is a change since my town only has 1400 people living in it . all so big BIG big I feel like I have been bent and thrown around right now I need to get some more sleep but I cant do that right now I am falling into this trap of thinking about my thoughts and my thoughts are typical and dull to me but I am not typical and dull WHY ARE my thoughts coming out this way on paper. Maybe it has something to do with trying too hard or subconsciously knowing complete strangers are going to read this (I like to write my thoughts for myself. Sorry 20 minutes is up . ,0
869,"My mind keeps jumping back and forth between this year right now and like all of high school. I have such problems with sharing people and friends that my mind is constatly taking me back ana forth to times when I've been in sumilar situations. Cheaters are something I end up with a lot when I date people so the idea of sharing male friends is sdcary to me, I feel bad for being jealous of other girls who hang out with my male friends, but I can't help wondering if they are all destined to follow the same pattern as everyone else. My com[puter is broken in my room so I have to use the lab. I can't stand the noise of either bi;llion people typing at once, and the talking girls behind me are growing more annoying by the minutes. Cranky woulsd be a good wor to decribe how I feel. Reelly Really cranky. I don't know why either, so far everything has gone my way, from rush to guys to sports to school (thats what I'm here to do right?) but at the same time I'm being a total crab! I guess it's gets back to that damn jealousy thing again. I hate that part of myself, it's annyoing as all hell and I can't ever seem to get past it, the rest of my life is totally laid back, yet this is the one part that I freak out on. I can't imagine writting straight for twenty minutes. It took me three to write this, so I can't really understand how I can just blaber for twenty minutes. The sosrity girls are all really nice, the party at the delts was okay, ATO was pretty lame, but none of the new ADPi pledgees no anyone so I'm hoping that once we do some mixers or something along those lines I'll know some more people and therefore have more to do at these parties besides drink my ass off. There's an ATO bar-tab tonight at Sidestreet and a PhiSI party somewhere too, but beong a nice friend I offered to stay in with Brad who is walking on to the football team tomorrow, but he's also got three other girls upstairs, there's the jealousy thing again. Yarg. I left my shoes at the house and don't havce any comfy shoes to wear tmomorrow, sigh. The pledge retreat is this weekend, actually more likethis friday and some of saturday, so that'll be fun, but it's a little scary becasue we are all still just getting t knowone and other. I can't go to the first football game because the girl I was surposed to get tickets with ditchedout on me and I don't have a ticket, so going is not going to be possible, which sucks, becuase I really did want to go and get all involved and stuff. Good god, it's annyoing to have al this to do, I can't imagine how much time all these assignments are going to take, between this class and my theatre major-stuff, I have nooo time and am surposeds to join two outside organizations besides my sorority. If I get cast in a show, there isn't any way I'll be able to make any meetingings with any kind of consistency, but I really wantto beinvolved in everything thats going on. I have to do my laundry too. Somethings got to go and that looks like sleep, at least for the first semester sleep is going out the window until I get this grades business firgured out. Okay, ten minutes left. My room smells like stale coffee (true dorm) and chicken soup becasue retard king brad spilled soup on my floor, and we cleaned it up with paper twels, but not like actual soap, so I'm kinda scared as to what might be living under my bed at the moment. I have new momagrammed sheets that I'm way psyched to put on my bed, because they are those totally comfy jersey knit sheets, and I'm all about soft stuff. My room has turned into a pit, by the way, toaly a disaster area. Yuck-ola. My wallet has been getting fatter, but not, sadly, with money, way too many passwordsa nd numbers accounts and figures to rmemeber just to use these damn computers that run WAY too slow for their own good, or anyone elses for that matter. God damn. I tried to go ahead and do the survey so I don't acidentally forget and not doit, but the comnputer wouldn't laod it becasue I was transimiting my social security number and it didn;'t like that at all, so I guess I'll have to find a friend and mooch of them. Bad time to quit smoking. Almost done. The yamm,ering can stop shortly. Found my comfy pants on a non-cranky not, and that's wonderful becasue I could really use some good comfy pants to just lounge around in. My room looks like a laundry basket blew up on the floor and splattered everythingin it's path. My poor roommate, I don't know how she puts up wih all my shit. She just got cheated on and I feel so terrible having been in the same posotion myslef,and I wsh guys weren't such total morons about stuff like that. boohoo hormones. Two minutes left. I can't understnd my TA in math calss. He speaks english about as well as I speak french, and I know three french words. People say numbers are universal, yeah right, try sitting through a math class with a non-native english speaker as your teacher and see how universal they are come finals. Ah! Done. ",0

I believe ti to be true. I can see how most of us would get depressed. the whole new environment. new friends. keeping up with old friends. worrying about how to fit in. about grades, and gpa's and food and getting the freshman fifteen. find a family church. keeping strong in faith and healthy relationships. and to add to that everyone's else's problems. hm. that was a good kiss.

416,"It is Friday, which means that school is done for the first week. My classes have gone extremely well. I have calculus, MIS, Psychology, Intro to Western Music, BA101. My calculus teacher is kind of hard to understand, though. I am also very happy because I have worked out at the gym every day since moving here. I am trying to lose weight and have already lost three pounds. I am also trying to eat better. I run for between 10 to 30 minutes, walk, and do the bicycle machine. The Castilian looks like it has delicious food, but since I'm trying to eat healthy, it's kind of hard looking at all the people eating ice cream, pizza, hamburgers. Once I get to my goal weight, I am going to allow myself one food treat a week. Another reason I am happy is that my email is finally working. It took two hours for a man here to set up my internet. I was on the phone yesterday for like eight hours trying to set up my email. No one seemed to be able to help me. A guy came in today and hooked me up in less than half an hour. Now I have a ut account and one with Juno. I emailed my dad today, and he wrote back. Tonight I hope I do something fun. It is great having a roommate I have been friends with since the sixth grade. We both know when to study and when to have fun. We study every week night and try to go to bed as early as we can. She is in Architecture. She is going to be very busy with that. My sister did not go to college. My parents are moving to Austin in September. That will be convenient for when I want to see them. The window to our room is open right now and it feels great out. The tower is chiming and I am in a fantastic mood. Earlier, when I was in the elevator, the lights turned out for a second and it seemed as though the power was going to turn off. I gasped!  I feel lucky to be able to come to college here to get an excellent education. I hope to have a job I love once I graduate and to be successful. Once I get my first job after college I plan on saving a lot of money and also investing. I think about my future a lot. I'm kind of a worrier. I've met some really nice people at the Castilian. A lot of the girls here just got finished rushing for their sororities. I didn't do that. I don't think I have time for it as well as how much money it becausets. I was surprised that two of my professors are women and the class I haven't gone to yet is also taught by a teacher. For some reason I felt that a lot of the professors were going to be males. I did not bring a car to school because the car I had was really old. We've had it since before I was born. It's a 1979 Toyota Corolla. I had a love/hate relationship with it. I loved it because I've known it forever. I hated it because it was so slow and had no radio. I had a yellow jam box in there so I could listen to tapes I made. It got really good gas mileage, though. A lot of people from my home town, Temple, go to school here. My roommate's older sister is a sophomore at UT and she stayed at the Castilian last year. We requested her room and got it. We face the tower. I forgot to take my vitamin today. I should do that before I go to dinner. I can't wait until I can have a dog. I love dogs. When I was in elementary and middle school I had a Yorkshire Terrier named Candi. She was the cutest little thing!!!  My roommate had a really great mutt the whole time I knew her named Charlie. He had to be put to sleep. Her family got a new dog who is really stupid named Bailey. His parents names were (not joking) Terry Punky Panda and Cowboy Junkie Jow. This dog is literally the stupidest dog I've ever met. He doesn't understand when you don't want him near you. He's chewed up a lot of my roommates stuff at home. Both her mom and my dad work for the same company. Hopefully this coming summer I can get a job there doing something. I've had a job since I turned 16. Well, Got to Go. I'm going to eat dinner and take a shower for tonight. I am in a great mood!!!!! ",1
649,"The reality that college isn't just one continuous party is finally beginning to set in now that I have chpaters of information to read in all of my classes. I think somewhere in my mind I thought that college would be easier and less stressful than high school because it seems like there'e more free time. Well, I know now that this will not be so. All my free hours during the week will be full of reading, studying, writing, reading, studying, writing. I'm really afraid that I won't know what to expect on examinations. I've spent about an hour reading twenty pages out of my psychology book and can't imagine what I'm going to do. Reading and reading gets so boring, except when the material is very interesting. I also started reading my Economics, and enjoyed reading the parts that I recognized as being covered in class. I've discovered that going out every night and staying out until 2:00 a. m. is not going to cut it. The first week of school I tried this and could hardly stay awake during class. There are lots of pressures both externally and internally to go out and ""party"" and meet people every night. Externally, I'm a member of a sorority and we're supposed to party a lot with our sorority sisters. Internally, I feel like I'm missing out or something if I don't go. Maybe there's a cute guy out there just waiting for me to meet him, yeah right. I ran into this guy randomly on the street outside of UTC that I had met at Orientation. We recognized eachother and talked for a minute. A couple days later I saw him in my EConomics class. It would be so cool if some how we were to start talking or something. But, great things like that usually don't happen to me. My roommate and friend across the hall both make fun of me for having such a crush on this guy. I really like them a lot. We all got so lucky with the girls staying in our hall. Everyone is so nice and we get along well. I especially like my roommate. We have the same interests, likes, and dislikes. We aren't in the same sorority which kind of makes me sad, but we still do stuff together. Last night we stayed in and worked on our psych pretesting which took me like two hours after the UT football game. We were pretty bummed that they lost. ",1
1310,"Today has been pretty easy. That girl in nursing got on my nerves, but at least I am out of there. For once, I actually do not have a headache yet. And it's already almost noon. I wish I didn't have to go to work today. It's not that I don't like working there, it just takes up so much time. Most of the people are nice. I wish I didn't have to stand up all the time, though. My back itches. It is really hot in my room. Lately, it has been freezing in here. It is probably because I am sitting right by the window. This assignment is really making me tired. However, I actually got almost 8 hours of sleep last night, which is practically a record for a school night. Maybe that is why I don't have a headache yet. Tonight, though, I need to go to the gym and work out. I have only worked out once since I've been here. I think I am getting out of shape, even though I seem to walk miles to my classes everyday. Oh well, it's not like I'm overweight or anything. I am probably losing weight since the cafeteria food is pretty bad sometimes. It used to make me sick for the first few days I was here. My neck itches now. I think it is moving! Oh my goodness I can't wait until this weekend. I finally get to go home and eat some normal food. Most of all, I get to see Chris. I miss him so much. I'm not really lonely all the time without him, but I am never really happy like I used to be. But after I see him for a few days and have to leave him again, I am sure I'll be pretty lonely. It makes me realize what is was like to be there with him all the time. Now my head itches. My back hurts. I haven't had a massage since I've been here. That would be so nice. Anyways, I just ate a nasty lunch and I feel kind of nauseous. Yuck. Dinner tonight is Mexican food and I think I'll walk to the union to eat. I am really tired now. This type of writing seems to put me into a trance. I feel like I need to take a nap now. I don't think that is possible though, since I have to be at work in about 45 minutes. At least that is the last thing I have to do today. I don't think I even have any homework. Maybe I'll take a nap after work. Well, actually, I need to call Chris after work. Maybe I'll take a nap after that. The room seems like it has cooled off a lot. Maybe the air conditioner finally kicked in. My neck and back are so stiff. I want to lay down so bad but I know that if I do, I'll probably fall asleep. My roommate slept in this morning. That was a good idea. I can't wait to see Chris. This weekend should be so much fun. I get all anxious hoping that everything goes well. I haven't seen my parents in 3 weeks. I know my mom is just dying to see me and my brother. I need to email her. I need to email Chris too. I wonder what Brian is up to. Maybe I should call him. I don't think I will because he is probably in class and I really don't want to talk to his roommate. Speaking of roommates, I need to talk to my ra. about the roommate contract she emailed us about. I have no idea what she is talking about. Oh well. My twenty minutes in finally over. I think I will go lay down. ",1
402,"Metallica. Some of the old stuff so its a lot more music and fewer lyrics. But really, now that I think about it, twenty minutes is a long time to write. At some times, my head is full of random thoughts I can write about but there are not too many tonight. I think part of that is because I am tired. I knew Mondays would be long when I registered for classes and ended up with a lab from seven to nine on monday night. But today seemed long. At least my classes are manageable except for Calculus. I think I will have to work harder to keep up in that class. Actually work hard just to stay with it instead of working to be far ahead. Well maybe I won't have to take too many more difficult math classes after the next couple of semesters, especially if I transfer out of elec. engineering and go into the business school. But I heard the other day that not many of the classes you take in the engineering courses transfer well to business so I may have to start over. I know that the computer science course I added will not transfer but I decided to take it anyway because I would like to know how to program at least in a general way. Never know when that could come in handy. It sure has been hot the last few days. Weeks. Months. I have also had to walk all over campus just to get all of the administrative stuff out of the way like paying my add bill today and getting the sports package over at the stadium. I got a lucky  break and got to pay in the UGL instead of having to wait in the very long line for the cashiers in the main  building. A lot of stuff has happened in the last few weeks. I wonder how Tricia is doing. And Daniel. And Chad. He really had a tough week last week. I feel bad about writing that screwy email. It just reminded him that he didn't get to go to the college he wanted. I wonder what caused the extra fees? Too bad he won't get to play football for them. That reminds me that we are going to the game Saturday. I need to go get tickets tomorrow. In the morning after class. The food has gotten bad over the last few days. Maybe it comes in cycles of the stuff I like. Or maybe they just serve the good, fresh stuff the first week or so to give the impression that the food is actually good. That is the funnier one to tell. It is always good to have a good cafeteria joke for all of the family and other people back home. Sterotypes of college. Most are at least partway true but sometimes it gets tiresome trying to explain the real so you just let them believe it and so forth and so on this paper is dragging on I really don't think they mean to read them all. Should I include all of this stuff or just do some selective deleting? I guess if anyone reads this they will never know anyway. What do you think? Do you think I deleted anything? That will remain one of life's little (very little) mysteries. That about does it for the twenty minutes. Only a few seconds to go. I wonder if I will finish with this sentence or if it will go on until the time ",1
1778,"     I am afraid of being here. I think that I am not smart enough or that I just don't have what it takes. I think about my boyfreind alot! he is my bestfriend. Sometimes I feel like I can't live without him. I hate feeling that way but i can't help it. my biology class is stupid. i hate sitting there for an hour and a half wondering what the heck she is talking about. i wonder what my mom is doing right now. my little sister is in school right now and is probably having way more fun than i am. i can't wait until october 4th it is going to be great. i get to finally see my boyfriend again after 2 months. gosh that seems like a long time. i wonder if he is thinking of me right now. i know he better have wrote a letter on sunday. i love getting his letters. they make me feel very happy and i read them over and over and over. sometimes i don't knwo if i am just kidding myself about our relationship but then i remember how much i miss him and how perfect we are together. is there actually soemthing out in the universe that is perfect?  is there some object that can meet standards that to majority is perfect?  i know i am not perfect. i am so nervous about gaining weight. i always watch what i eat but it always like too much no matter what i eat. i hate feeling that wat too. i love beanie babies. they are soo cute. i used to collect them but now I dont. not that its because i got older but just because i don't have the money to spend on them anymore. I wonder why people are the way they are. Some people can be soo mean but have no reason to be that way. I wonder if I am that way. I wonder if people see me as snobby or dumb. I always look around the room and i wonder if people are just as confused as me. I try to look as if i am not confused but i don't think it works to much. I want to move with my boyfriend. I want to be near him alwyas. I always think about him. Is that unhealthy?  I like pizza. it is vrey good i want pizza now. i love fruit too. i think fruit can be better than icecream although i love icecream too. if i had to choose right now i would eat a peach. i don't know why but tomorow i would probably eat icecream. I don't think that i fit into this city. i think sometimes that maybe i shoould have stayed in killen. i love music i have to listen to it in order to make my day start out good. i love dirty south music but then again i love all kinds of music. how can someone only like certain types of music?  i don't believ e that. they make themselves think that. I think that music is a form of expression and you should listen to the music before saying  what is that,country?     ewwww!    I love anything that makes me feel good inside. I kind of would like to move to florida. my friend Argelis lives there but i went there for a band trip and i had such a good time. i was with my boyfriend and we did everything. evreybody told us that they sat around. we went on every ride there was. then before my boyfriend left to the navy we went to San Antonio. we went there all by our selves and did everything our way. no one  to tell us what to do or how to do it. it was great. We saved all our money and made sure we had enough to spend. I loved the shows at sea world. My favorite was fools with tools and how they made fun of all the other shows. It was great. There too me and my boyfriend went to every show and eveyr ride although there werent much rides. I hope we don't have to read our papers infront of the class. I don't think i did my paper right. What if i sound stupid?  oh well, i am probably not the only one that thinks that. i am not sure if i am going to switch my major becaus psychology is soemthing that i have always wanted to learn. my highschool teacher was soo cool. I loved visiting the Austin State hospital. It was so fascinating how those people could actually think those ways and believe everything they feel. I kind of felt sorry for some of them too. I don't know how to feel when it comes to people that are disabled, shoudl I feel sorry or luck to know them? ",1
461,first a bit of background  last Friday on my way home at three in the morning my brother flipped our car and it rolled twice  I guess my last few days have been mainly taken up by thoughts of what happened I guess I am the kind of person who analyzes what they do after the fact and right now I'm trying to go through my emotions really wasn't afraid I wonder why I mean we were that close to death if we had flipped 10 yards later we would have fallen fifteen feet into a creek but as it was nothing happened so  really I just kid of went on with my life so I'm not dwelling on the crash what I am dwelling on is the fact that I was over the crash in a meter of minutes  this is the kind of thing that shapes many peoples lives but it seems to have no impact on mine  I'm not more or less kind I don't enjoy life more  I even had fun that weekend  I don't feel that I am truly any closer to God   I am not praying any more  not that that is how I judge my relationship with God but even how I judge my relationship a no closer  weird I should have done this later on I think better at night but if I wrote what I was thinking on here tonight instead of on paper I would lose these thought so I guess it is better this way I can always rewrite what I type onto paper but then I would feel the urge to revise and I haven't fully come to the conclusion whether that is right or wrong yet I mean what is what I truly think and feel what is  spur of the moment and straight from the heart or what is what I can put together over time so I haven't yet presented myself with the option by trying to rewrite what I write neater or type it  I guess they are both valid or it's hard to type as fast as I think why I write on paper what I this but then even I can't read what I write half the time    on a more petty note I am worried about math I just have no idea what to expect but that is something that I can put to the back o my mind   I'm trying not to think of anything school related because I want to write on that next time but some overlapping is probably ok I'm worried about math because I don't know what to expect that is the difference between high school and college in high school you could mess up on the first quiz or test and not worry about it because you had twenty more grades to bring it back up in college if you misjudge the teacher and screw up on the first test it will be very hard to bring the grade back up for the semester it would be like taking an entire six-weeks in high school to learn how a teacher gives tests  oh well   ,0
800,"What am I thinking of right now?  I am thinking of how different my life now is. it is hard to believe that almost 3 weeks ago I left the city to which I have known as home my entire life <houston> and moved to austin by myself, with really no friends, no family and no place to really call home here. But everyone loves austin, right, and I am really lucky to be here, right?  I don't know but all I know is that I hope I made the right choice, my parents and friends, and family members really miss me and I miss them as well. I just really feel so lonely up here, I mean all I really do is study and watch television, not really being very social with that many people. And the weird thing is I am a very social person-- I mean in houston I had I think seven very clost friends, and now I have probably five okay friends that live in the same city as me, and who am I talking to when I am on the phone--my friends from houston, NOT austin. I think I am just in a period of adjustment right now, or at least I think and hope that I am. please do not let my college experience turn into this--my worst dream. why is it so hard for me to move on and make new best friends, it is not like I would forget about my friends from houston, I could be close to both sets of friends, and why is it that no people are out of there way friendly here, is it me?  no it cannot be me, that is what I always seem to tell myself, that it is not me. Gosh, I feel like I am having a conversation with myself right now, or that this an entry in my diary or journal or something!  But this is truly how I feel at this very moment in time---scared, alone, and wishing that I were somewhere else. I am really not trying to whine or anything, but how am I supposed to feel?  I am alone in a city, with nobody close, with whom I can communicate with. And these are supposed to be the best years of our lives, right?  Just checking because I plan to hold whoever first said it on that. Other than that, everything is going great, I am keeping up with my classwork, studying every night, with no disturbances. WHY?  because I have no friends up here, I realize that I am complaining an awful lot and really exaggerating when I say I have no friends. But like I said earlier:  I am a very social person, and when I do not have caring people around me, I feel left out. And that just about ends the twenty minutes, I guess it's on to the next one---and Yes, it does feel good to get this out in the open.         ",1
2003,"I'm very tired right now. I know that I have not been getting the amount of sleep that I need. Is this how college is all the time?  Over this past weekend, I realized that I am beginning to get very homesick. I really miss my family, friends, and my dog. I started crying when I was on the phone with my brother earlier today. School is getting stressful, especially with band. I got a letter today saying I needed to work more on my routines. I don't know what to do. I've already put off so much, and gotten behind because of band. I practice and try to keep up with my studies. I think I really need to focus myself a little more. Sometimes I think it is the new freedom that is causing this. I know what I need to do, I just need to get motivated to do them. I also need to learn how to not procrastinate. I've been thinking a lot about Andrew lately, and about the church. I'm still so indecisive about what to do. Sometimes I think that I believe and sometimes I think that I'm really not sure. Now I'm thinking about death. I don't think there is anything I fear more than that, and what's sad is I know that everyone must pass through it. It terrifies me. I would never take my own life. I'm too scared of what's after, and I love my life to much. Even with all of the stress I still find things interesting. I am still proud of the things I have achieved. I have very high goals for myself and I am so excited about the future. There are so many things to look forward too. Why do people get depressed?  I've never been one to be truly unhappy. Even when there are times I said I was depressed"" I never really was. It makes me sad to think that people can get so down about themselves. I was talking to Chris yesterday, and reading his online journal thing. It made me want to cry. I don't see how he thinks he will never find the right person, or be successful in life. He is such a wonderful person, and has so many things going for him. Why don't people see that? Why can't they see that even with all of the bad in the world there is still good?  You know that makes me think. I am so obsessed with my life and what I do and the people I know. I think that everyone is just as worried about their life and their friends and family as I am. We all live in our own world, in our own bubble, our own space. I think that this assignment is pretty cool. I actually do this quite often. Just start writing things down. Oh man!  I just thought of what I was writing last week, about the first football game. I don't think I could ever described the rush when I marched through that tunnel. It was so crazy with over 80,000 people there in one place. watching the band march in. I had the room to myself this weekend. My roommate went out of town. It was nice. I love being with people and being with my friends, but I also really enjoy my quite time and my personal time. My roommate is really nice. I feel I've been blessed because we get along so well. I haven't met as many people as I thought I was going to meet up here. well. I guess I have met people, but I haven't made as many friends as I thought. Friendships just take time though. I really wish Michelle was here. I miss her. I was so glad we worked everything out before we went our separate ways. She is always been such a great friend. I respect her so much. I don't know what I would do with myself if it had been my mom. That is another one of my big fears. losing a loved one. When Michelle's mom died so suddenly a couple of years ago we were all so shocked. I don't think there was one of us that didn't give our own Mom's huge hugs the day we found out. I was so upset, and Michelle had me call everyone and tell them. That was so hard. So many people thought it was a cruel joke. Why do people do that?  Go into denial. I guess I would have if somebody had called me and told me that. That was two years ago. Time flies so fast. It doesn't even seem like two years. Only like yesterday. Sometimes I wish we could just freeze time. During those special moments or the happiest time. just make time stop. even if it just added and extra minute, I think it would be nice. Oh look, my time is almost up. ",1
2387,"     I am at a study hall room at the time wondering what I will think about that I am going to write. There are people behind me talking and one went Ole Miss which makes me think of a friend of mine from high school who is a freshman there now. I wonder how he is doing now along with all my other friends that is not attending UT. There are actually several people going here from my high school but I only see about half of them on a regular basis. I am a little stressed with all the things going on because I have done the thing that everyone has said not to but I think no matter what it happens to everyone. It is just the thought of all the freedom and then all of a sudden a couple weeks go by and there are quizes, tests, and papers due at the same time. I am also stressed about so many different things such as a typical college freshman is. One guy said that his fine arts was theater and dance. That made me think about when I was confused on what to take when I was signing up for classes. People ask me what this is that I am typing because they can read exactly what I am thinking. I am actually hungary with all these people talking about food. Is kind of a word? Not sure but it should be. I just found a phone on the desk but completely forgot that it was mine until I opened it up. I lost my phone a week ago so I don't have any of the numbers that I used to have, I hope this is not being graded for correct grammer because I am trying to type as fast as I think. I have already been typing for 10 minutes already and am wondering what else I am going to talk about. I also don't know what class I am going to drop, which haves to be done tomorrow. I cannot take 16 hours that I am currently signed up for so I will drop one to drop down to 13 hours. A friend of mine just called saying that he cannot make it to lunch. A guy is just now sitting beside me and he is about to start eating something. That makes me hungary again. He is reading everything I type and just corrected me on a mistake. I am running out of things to say or talk about. I am thinking now about my place and hearing some stories in the background. Most people are done with their homework and are asking me questions about this assignment, I am actually kind of comfortable right now at the computer. I don't have a computer yet at my apartment so it is really hard for me to get to an actual one to do assignments and get notes off the internet. I have yet to figure out how many notes to take from class since everything is different in college. I have a lot of stuff to do like go to WalMart, the grocery store and other places to get caught up on everything. Only a few more minutes left until I am done with this. I wonder again if this is for completion grade or even if it is going to be read. I bet the counselors read all these to see if we are all okay since majority of the class is freshman. Wow, I cannot believe that the twenty minutes is almost up. I'm going into a blank thought because of this pressure that the timer is putting on me for some reason. What else should I say? ",0
845,"Right now I am very tired, and I really don't know why. I got enough sleep yesterday, but then again I had a very busy day yesterday. It must have been when I went to try out for the texas crew team. I am not sure whether I should join, and it has been bugging me all day. If I join, I will have to sacrifice many things. First off, I would have to get up really early in the morning and I am not use to that. Second, time would be another sacrifice. I would have less time to do other things,  and would have to learn how to manage my time very efficiently. I am really missing the girl that I left back home in order to come attend the university. She was so good to me, never complaining and always doing things for me, even if it was at her expense. We got along great, hardly ever fighting. I miss going to her house every day and talking to her and her parents. Her parents were really good to me also. This girl was going through a really hard time in her life when I met her. I am greatful that I was a big part in helping her get through this time in her life. That time was when her parents were getting divorced. She got through it fairly well, but then her mom remarried quickly. This upset her a great deal. I enjoyed the fact that I could be there for her when she needed me. As a result of her mom's remarriage, she now has a new stepsister and stepfather. Her stepsister is really making her life tough. For that, I resent her stepsister. She disobeys her father and stepmother, steals my girl's clothes, and is a big slut. This girl is named Emily. Emily really pisses me off a great deal. Why does she have to be that way. Nobody has done a damn thing to her, but yet she seems to make the lives if the people around her miserable. I think about my girl quite often, but I know that I am up here for the reason of getting an education. I don't know whether I should move on and try to find someone new, or hold off and just visit her when I am home. But while I am in Austin, the main thing to concentrate on is my studies. It seems that my classes are going to be somewhat difficult. At first I was bit scared, but I know I can come out on top if I put the work and time in. It is sometimes hard to manage time between working out, studying, and having a good time. But it can be done. I am slowly learning the things necessary to become a good student here at UT. I plan to do the best that I can possibly do, and hopefully, if god is willing I will make it through alright. Wow, it has already been twenty minutes and I've got to make a class. ",1
212,"I really am tired. I can't understand why I have so much to do and I haven't even started maybe I'm just lazy and I don't think. Could be I'm just a loser. No I'm not! I just want to be accepted for who I am and not for what I am I can't stand to eat Jester food. It tastes better when I'm already full. It makes me sick sometimes and I have to use the bathroom a lot. How many times do you think I can say a lot without spitting on myself. I like this song it  makes me think of parties, dancing girls. I miss my girlfriend, why can't I be with her. Too bad. Just be strong, If the person reading this actually knew me I wonder what he/she would say? Who cares! I don't care anymore. Just give me an A. Is that what it's all about an ""A"" we should try to learn something for a change in America instead of taking the shortcut approach. My fingers are getting tired. I'm hungry but it's too early to eat dinner What moron decided that dinner should be served at 4:30? If I get my hands on him/her, I would probably do nothing but laugh. Ha Ho Ha. Funny dude, that's me. How many times do I have to keep hitting the repeat button on the CD player. It's pissing me off. I wonder what would happen If our nipples were on our foreheads. I'm a dick for. A lot of people ask what's a dickfor? Funny huh? You probably think I'm sort of a psycho or pervert. Why won't this program automatically return me to the beginning of the document. If I get drunk this weekend I may feel better. probably not. I really miss her. She's got my heart forever. I wonder if this is the way I should feel. Who knows? I can't stand a cold shower. My phone just rang but I cant answer it because I have to do this stupid homework. I hope I don't get demoted for calling it stupid homework. Tired, sleepy. Do you know what time it is. I really miss my sister. She took care of me. She's only 15 though but she's my only true friend. I can count on her to do anything I ask her. Most of the time. Who knows If she gets married to one of my friends, I could be the best man. Who knows a way to type and answer the phone and do this stuff in one motion. I hope a little pause in my typing doesn't hurt my grade. I don't even understand why someone would even spell phone with a ph instead OF an f. My caps accidentally came on change the damn station roommate. He's gone. Black hole sun. Fair-weather friend. Dancing in the woods naked with a beautiful blonde wouldn't be so bad.

2279,Ok so I am writing about my thinking. Well tonight was interesting. I had a great time at the Phi Lamb meeting. Laura was really sweet I hope that I will get to know her better. I wonder who my big sister will be in Phi Lamb. Hmm interesting. I love big sisters in organizations. Which is kind of crazy because I just talked to my big sister from the drill team I was a part of in high school. Random. Even though it kind of sucks because my own big sister is completely insane and never talks to me. I promise when I have kids they will never be more than like three years apart. I can't believe that in ten years I will probably be married with kids and all that. Oh my gosh. Where has the time gone? I am actually excited about being a mom. My mom was amazing. She may have some interesting points of view and be a little too concerned with my appearance but you have to love her. No one can argue like her that's for sure. I miss her. But I will see her this weekend. I can't believe how awesome it is that she got tickets to this game. It is crazy. I can't wait to show her around now that campus has started to feel more like a home. Which is totally crazy. I never thought I would get this adjusted to living in a strange new place this fast. But I guess that is a good thing. I will be here for four years so I should probably make it feel like home. So now that my boyfriend calls I am thinking about him. I can't believe I am doing this whole long distance relationship thing. It is the hardest thing in the world. I miss him so much and there is like no way to see him until late October. I wonder if we will make it. I know we can but it is so crazy. Four years of being six hours apart. I wonder what we would be like married. It would be amazing to be his wife. He is the most amazing guy I have ever known. Everything I could ask for he has. But still I get scared sometimes. I wish I could be just a little bit closer with a little more access to him. I guess it is kind of good that we are this far apart because it kind of lets me experience life on my own yet with that amazing love and support only a phone call away. I also know that if we were here together we would spend like all of our time together which wouldn't be good for either of us. I believe you need to explore yourself in college and it would be hard if I had him there with me all the time. Anyways wow it is already eleven. I really like this song. I had never really listened to Jack Johnson but it is very relaxing. I wish song number four would come on it is definitely my favorite or the song that is playing right now I like this one too. It kind of relates to the whole long distance relationship thing which is probably why I like it so much. I wish we had a TV though that would get me away from this computer and talking to people on instant messenger. Which is great but I don't know whatever. Tomorrow is Thursday. I don't really like Thursdays. My classes are harder and there are more of them which is ok I guess. I had a lot of homework for tomorrow. College is a lot different than high school in workload. Like actually having to read all this stuff in every class is crazy. I guess its good that I am typically an overachiever. Well that is what my boyfriend and friends tell me. But whatever. I hope tomorrow goes by fast. I can't wait till Friday. I get to go out on a boat. That is going to be so much fun and then Saturday is the football game. I can't wait for that. I have never been to a UT game so it is definitely going to be an experience. Wow it has been twenty minutes. I guess I am done. Ok bye. ,1
840,"camping was fun. got a little too drunk. I think I'm getting sick though. sore throat, headache, the usual routine. no worries. I hope I can be as happy as those people we camped with. even though they were kinda old they were still really cool. and they were partiers. it's wierd to think that peopole so different in age can totally relate to each other. I thought it was going to be a boring weekend but I think I actually learned a lot. I hope that when I'm that old I can still appreciate life as much as they do. they were just so gracious for everything they had even if it wasn't a kings life. and that one guy was the shit. I can't imagine being shot out of a cannon. he must have some great stories. I hope I can see dustin tonight. that would be bad ass. but I would really really like to see a sunset too. I'm definatley lacking in the sunset category. but I don't think the ones here will be nearly as good as el paso. damn I miss el paso. I miss the desert. I could go for laying in the bed of a pickup truck and watching the stars while listening to good music. maybe some live acoustic shit. bongos and guitars. that's the shit. I love gummy bears. the white ones are the best. but the other day we got a really weird one. it was big and gflat and tasted fujnny. but it was good. it was so good that we even split it between three people. so d'lane and I met this guy deniz. I don't know about him.     I have hella ant bites. they suck. all ants should die. a painful, painful death. I need to paint my toenails. that will be fun. I love my new fish clarence. he's so cool!  but he's a very deepo sleeper and he likes to play dead a lot just to mess with my mind. I hate fish!  but for some weird reason I really like that guy. but I miss my kitty a lot. that's a bummer. well I think it's been 20 minutes. ",0
2370,"well I guess it'll be good to get this out of the way. Let's see what's on my mind. ok I think I need to turn off the TV and maybe turn on a little music. this seems like it could get boring. hmm. maybe that's a bad sign that I think my thoughts are goig to be boring. anyway, all right, the tv's off and now the musics on. much better. well I'm officially pledging phi delt tonight. I'm going to be assigned my big brother at the meeting this evening and I'm pretty excited. I think this is going to be a lot of fun. john's pledging with me and I guess we're going to get to be pretty good friends. this is kind of nice. this is a good way to clear my thoughts up. I've heard before that writing out everything makes you slow your thoughts to the pace of writing and it's an effective way to clear your head. what kind of phrase is that. clear your head? that's a weird thing when you actually think about it. ok I can't talk about one thing for very long. wow this time is going pretty fast. it doesn't seem like I've been writing long at all and I'm a quarter of the way done. ok well let's accomplish something productive here. what do I need to do today? I need to get khakis and a white shirt for tonight. hmm I wonder what I should do about shoes. I didn't bring my dress shoes I don't think. that's one bad thing about being 8 hours from home. when I remember something that I forgot to bring, or didn't think I would need, there's not much I can do about it. ok what else do I need to do today. its labor day. I like not having class. umm ok think, I need to study chapter 5 in biology. really I need to review all of the chapters that's got to be my biggest priority today. and I need to finish reading my psych chapters and philosophy stuff. I feel like I always  have something to do. it was this way in high school too though so I guess its not that bad. there's a guy pledging with me that reminds of somebody famous but I can't place it. I don't think I've ever heard this song but I know the band. that's not saying much for the band. or maybe it is. either they have a unique sound or all of their songs sound too much alike. I don't know which it is in this case. maybe a little of both. ok the time is not going as quickly as I thought it was. do I have anything else to do today? clothes, read, umm I've talked to my mom today about everything I think I needed to tell her. I paid my stupid parking ticket. there's 40 bucks wasted on me stupidity. I thought about appealing it but they called out my exact reason for the appeal on ""reasons not to appeal your ticket"" apparently just being a dumbass isn't a valid reason. I love this song. barenaked ladies are a good band. I want to see them in concert again. oh concert. I can't wait for the acl festival coming up. and next weekend I'm going to mexico with the phi delts. oh this is going to be a lot of fun. I'm excited for so many things this semester. I just need to make sure I keep my grades up and everything. I'm sure I will. I don't forsee myself slacking off at all. if I want to get into medical school I need to have the best grades possible. but then I don't know if I really want to go to medical school. I need to talk to an advisor about this stuff. hopefully I can get into my fig advisor tomorrow and see what he has to say. I can't decide if I want to major in neurobiology or switch to liberal arts and look into psychology. I think this is a really interesting field but at the same time I feel like its uhhh I lost my train of thought. lets see. I feel like its umm something that too many people do. its over done as a major I guess I don't really know what word to use to describe it. woo! one minute remaining. umm so yeah psychology is really interesting. I'm actually not dreading reading the rest of the chapters. in fact I'm kind of looking forward to it. ok well the times up I guess I'll quit now. that was fun. ",1
1255,"It's hard to believe that my first year of college has begun. It's almost like I am at summer camp for a week, and I will be returning home in a week. However, that is just a false reality in my head. It's hard for me to grasp everything. It seemed to happen so fast. I left behind my family, my friends, my cheerleading squad, my town. Everything that is familiar has been traded in for a world of experience and confusion. What time is my next class? Where IS my next class? Where is everyone going tonight? It's mass confusion in my head. I want to be successful at college: academically, spiritually, emotionally and physically. I have already begun a steady workout and eating habits that make me feel good about my self, and so far I have enjoyed all of my classes. However, there's still that little thought in the back of my head that I am not getting everything done. I feel like there's this list of things to do ALL THE TIME and no matter what I do, I will never get them done. I have to admit, my first week of college was completely awful. I hated every moment of it. I cried everyday, called my mom, acted like a real baby. It was as if there was this strike against me that made sure NOTHING went my way. But as I have gotten used to the schedule and made a few new friends things seem to be looking up. I still feel like I don't fit in. This miniature ""society"" at the University of Texas is like a town within itself, and all of the citizens in this ""town"" seem so superficial. I don't feel like I have met anyone with one natural thought in his or her head. I can't believe how strange it is. It's as if the whole campus is full of sorority girls and fraternity guys. (No offense, it's just not me) I want to feel like a part of things but for the life of me I can't get in ""the loop. "" I make a few friends here and there, but as far as personalities, I feel like I am too real for everyone I have met. I am hoping that by next semester I will begin to make this dorm room my home and the people around me my family. It's not so much that I am homesick as it that I just miss fitting in. Back in High School there were no worries. Everything was laid out for you; only a few minor decisions to be made. I fit in so well. I knew my way around, I knew what was going on at all times; it was like a utopia in my little town of Sugar Land, TX. The only problem with the whole ""high school thing"" is that I was definitely a stereotype. (Another superficial moment in my life) I was a cheerleader all through High School. People at my school assumed I was a snobby, selfish girl who only thought the world of myself as well as my other cheerleader friends. They never even got the chance to know me. I can say right off- I am far from snobby. I love everyone and everything in this world. I am out to harm no one, except my self emotionally every once in a while! Why do teenagers feel the need to be so judgmental of each other? Why is it that I can't drive my Mustang Convertible in my cheerleading uniform without feeling like I am straight out of a ""Saved By The Bell"" episode? I am thinking that over time, an image has been created in everyone's mind on how things should be, and how people should look. Who is to say who and what we are? Why do I feel like I am always answering to someone? I can't make a decision without someone LOVING IT and someone else HATING IT. I hate the fact that the media has pounded into our brains what and who we should be. This is real life people. When you are doled out your genes-physical and personality-you don't get a choice. Some people honestly can't help the way they are. So why do we take the time to stop and make them feel even worse about their insecurities? I think the answer is within our OWN insecurities. It's sick that people feel better about themselves after putting someone else down. If a girl thinks she has ugly hair, she may announce that ""that girl over there"" has a horrible sense of fashion. Does that take away from the fact that she has ugly hair? I don't think so! So why has it become so necessary to step on whomever it takes to make you look better? My mind is full of these questions. I just know that as long as I am here, I plan to stay the real, down to earth girl that I am, as to not become a victim of my own insecurities. ",1
528,"I did it oncer in the 11th grade and my stream of concious isn't as intersting as everyone elses conciouses it seems. I like breakfast at Hardin House except for the fact that it closes down at 9 am the whole purpose of getting 10 oclock and 11oclock classes is so you can sleep until 9:30/10:30, but that doesn't happen when you have to wake up early. I hear sdomeone coming down the hall,  I wonder who it is. I think way faster than I can type. I wonder who is going to be reading this. probably some psychology grad student who can tell that I have hrrible typing skills,  the problem is that I reallt can't type withpout looking at the keyboard so I have problems with it. my sweetmate is ian the shower, she doesn't vbathe very much so that's is a refreshing thing. 5 minutes down. 15 more to go,  I wonder what I'll think about in the next 15 minutews, well 14 now. I need to call marlie back. that stupid psychology survey is always busy. I can't wait for my telesis to start woirking; I'm tired of using my roomates computer. I think she is tired of it to. have you ever noticed that even when someone types ""she is"" the reader usually reads it as ""she's"". I guess cause that's the way we talk. I like to write in journals and I guess that's stream of concius but I'venever been timed. matt fowler is a really smart guy. I still remember his stream of concious paper in the 11th grade. it was about chocolate mousse. hmmm. my roomates cousin is really goodlooking. I'm looking at his picture by her computer tright now. I think I'm trying to hard to come up with some thing cool to write down becasue nothing is runnign through my head right now, weell at least not slow enough to catch. I cannot believe I just let my vouicemail pickup my phone. damn, I am a devoted psychology student!  okay maybe I put that in there so matt would give me a couple brownie poingts. then again is this you reading this matt?  Is anyone readingthis or is this one of those do it for your own good projects?  I think this could possibly be the longest 20 minutes ogf my life, I really want to check my voice mail. I'm going to be pissed if the caller didn't leave a me3ssage. I wonder what's for breakfast tomorrow. I have a lot of reading to do before my classes. the problem with  college isd that everything can be put off until a later date. I've noticed that I'm hgaving a hard time not correcting some of my grammatical errors. can you imagine how hard this would be to read if I lewdft them all?  I guess it's jusyt habit. rhendi has really blonde hair. I can't believe I'm putting my name on this writing it couold possibly ber used as incriminating evidence  for what? I don't have a clue?  I feel sorry for whoever has to read these?  I wonder if Matt Fowler really wrote stream of concious or if he just wanted to sound cool so he planned it out? I don't like beer all freshmen guys are like trying to prove soething through beer I think. I don't know: just an observation. I like to sing I started my choir class today and I love it. so much better than highschool  besides the fact that everyone in there is a haus  my clothes are done strying. they're wrinkling because I still have 4 minutes lefgt to try and put my ming on a computer screen whoich is an impossible task. the words here represent about 5% of what has been runniong through my head. the number 5 and percentage sign are the sam ekey. wow. why are there so many houston people around? and everyopne from the nearby suburbs claims to be from Houtson too. I am not even going to read this?  Why? I'll never see it again. the girl sitting next to me in class today doesn't believe in God. it surpriised me,  I am the worlds most horribler typer. 20 minutes. ",1
2458,"I have so much work to do and it all seems to just pile up on me. In highschool I think was so used to just doing things the nigh before and I knew I could get it on but now that I'm in college I can't be doing that stuff. I had a weird dream when I took a nap after my 3:30 class. I drempt that I was at my physic teachers wedding and I was in the third row I believe and the lady he was marrying who was a chemistry teacher was mad that me and my friend were there at the wedding. The rings they were getting married with were being passed around and they both had big pearls on them. Right before the ceremony began my physics teacher looked back and recognized he had two former students at his wedding [me and my friend] and he smiled and then the dream ended. I kind of freaked out, I'm not sure why. When I woke up I wanted to call my friend and tell her about the dream. I didn't end up calling her. After I had been awake for a while I started thinking about my Junior year in highschool [which is when I had my Physics teacher], he was a pretty good teacher, I really learned a lot that year. My parents are coming up this weekend for the UT game, I get to see my little brother so I'm real excited for that. I miss him a lot. I just ate Wendy's a little while ago and I'm stuffed. I'm exhausted, my mind and body are very tired. Last night I fell asleep around 1:00 and that's the earliest I have fallen asleep since I've been here in Austin. In between and after classes I find myself napping and I think that makes it worse because at night I can't sleep at all. Me and my roommate really get along, I like that. Okay I think I'm going brain dead, or maybe its because I'm tired. I'm happy I'm getting this out of the way now rather than the day before, I know its not a big deal but still. It helps to just finish these things a little earlier than expected. I love Austin so much. I miss my friends back at home but I don't miss the Valley, which is where I'm from, Edinburg to be exact. It's' funny how things just fly by so fast, I wonder if college will fly by as fast as highschool did. who knows! I feel overwhelemd, not just with reading and school work but with other things beside that. My parents expect me to bring all A's and I guess that can be possible but come on, I don't think I'll get ALL A's through college. I just want to do well enough to get into the graduate school I want to go too. Another thing that's bothering me is the whole boy problem thing. My boyfriend goes to UTSA and its not the long distance thing that is bothering me, it's the whole ""being tied down"" part. There's so many people to meet here and I care about my boyfriend a lot but he messed up once and my ways of thinking about him and I have altered in a sense that could there really be someone else out there for me? My mom says I'll never know unless I ""venture out"" and see what could be out there. I think I'm the type of person that is nice, maybe too nice. Why do people take advantage of that? It's not fair. I think I need to be a more stronger person when it comes to certain issues. I guess these are just the typical girl problems. It's funny how guys don't really care or think about things like that. It's also funny how guys minds are so much different from girls and how their views are completely oppposite. I really need to catch up with reading in Psychology, I think that's the only think I'm a little behind in, as far as reading. I want to have a good semester and leave during the Christmas holidays knowing that I did my best as far as that semester was concerned. Today in Astronomy we talked about the stars and how old they are and all that stuff and today when I was walking back from Wendy's, I couldn't help but look up at the moon and stars and then reflect back to my Astronomy class. All that stuff is so cool. I would LOVE to go to the moon that would be cool, but its one of those things I want to do but probably wouldn't do it if I could. Well time is almost up and I enjoyed this a lot. Bye! ",0
2229,"I am sitting in my room watching the sandlot. Alessandra, my roommate is here too. She's getting ready to go home for the weekend. Shelley and Liz are both going home to. They offered me a ride, but I'm not going to go because I went home last weekend, and I don't want to go home two weekends in a row. Although I would really like to see Jordan, my boyfriend. He's at work right now and I'm waiting for him to call. The sandlot is on the part where Benny decides to jump the fence and get the baseball back from the neighbors yard. I've seen this movie a thousand times, the next thing to happen will be the dog chasing all the boys all around the town. This is probably one of my favorite baseball movies. My favorite of all time is definitely Field of Dreams. I always cry in the end where Kevin Costner's character plays catch with his dad. They didn't get along when he was younger and he never got to say that he was sorry for everything before he died. My dad and I have been getting along a lot more lately than we have been, I know that I would regret it if I just gave up on us getting along and said fuck it, so I'm glad we are at least trying to work things out. He apologized to Jordan this weekend for all the things he said to him this summer. Jordan came over and they had a talk on the back porch. I stayed inside and folded laundry because I felt awkward and tense about the whole thing. But apparently it went alright. I need to talk to my dad and tell him that I appreciate him doing that. I forgot to before. Actually, I just realized now that that's something I need to do. Probably should have said it earlier. I hope I didn't hurt his feelings. Oh well, like I said, I felt awkward about the whole thing in general. Which reminds me of a funny awkward moment I had today. I was at the Union with Shelley, and I went to the bathroom. Another girl was going in just as I was, and this made my shy bladder act up. She went into one stall, I went into the other, and I just couldn't go. Well, she wasn't going either, apparently, so we both just sat there for about a minute. I was trying hard to relax and finally I peed a little, but then it stopped. So the girl pees a little, and I pee a little more, but I still can't go all the way. I guess she gave up, because I heard the toilet flush and she left, so I was finally able to go. I went back to Shelley and told her the story. We were cracking up in the quietness of the Union 3rd floor. We started talking about Alex's engagement (again), which I feel guilty about because I am usually not the type to gossip, but it's hard to avoid talking about it. Before I saw Alex's ring (which is her grandmothers, Joe did not buy it), Shelley told me that it was 1. 7 carats, which is pretty impressive, but then I saw it, and looked at it closely, and it's not that great. Its color isn't that good, and it has a gigantic flaw in the side which I suppose Alex either hasn't seen or is just pretending that she can't see it. Jordan just called and I told him I need to call him back in eight minutes. Anyway, Alex is being really unrealistic about the whole engagement, wedding thing. She wants to get all these diamonds and a new setting for her ring, and she's looking at dresses that are 30,000 dollar, designer dresses, and the whole thing is just like a little girl planning some fantasy wedding. She doesn't seem to realize that the average middle class family can't afford something like that. But who knows, maybe her parents have more money than I think. Also, I don't know how seriously her parents have been taken her engagement. She's only been with Joe for about two months. I can hardly think about my future with Jordan now, and I definitely couldn't have thought about it after two months. The only thing I can say is that if we're still together when I graduate, I'll probably marry him. But I find myself thinking a lot that I want to be single, and I want to do all these things like travel and study aboard and maybe live in New York, and if someone is going to hold me back from those things, then I have to wonder if that's the person from me. I love him so much, but I also feel like I might be holding on to him because he's my first love and all that. He's such a great person though, I hope no matter what happens, that he will always be in my life. I just don't want to break his heart, or have my heart broken. I hope when it stops working, it just stops working for both of us and we can still be friends. Well, I have ten seconds left, so I think I'm going to call him now.   ",1
2108,"I'm a little nervous about doing this right now because I have to wake up at 445 tomorrow morning for crew practice. My back hurts -- it's from rowing on the orgs, or whatever they call them. I am not a good typist. I have to look down at my hands, and I go so slowly. This really is a skill I should have mastered by college. I feel like an idiot. I'm frustrated with Russell -- I don't really want to go to church on sunday because I know he will be there. I wonder if Brad really didn't call me for a week because I told him he was moving to fast or if it was because he was really sick. I can't believe I saw Travis today; I wonder if he really will ever give me a call -- doubtful, seriously doubtful. I need to turn on my lamp, I can't see and this computer screen is starting to hurt my eyes. I can't believe that Nik really didn't call me today -- even though his name showed up on my phone -- how bizarre!  I don't know how to spell bizaar -- oh well. My left shoulder muscle is hurting -- I think it's because of the position I'm laying in -- this is taking forEVER -- I'm only at 6 minutes. ouch. I just leaned up and turned on the lamp -- much better -- I can actually see the keys, even though you wouldn't be able to tell it by the way I'm still typing so messily. My ponytail is kinda digging into the back of my head -- dangit. I hate that I cuss now -- it makes me feel kinda dirty -- not like skank-dirty, but like not-so-clean dirty. That movie, THIRTEEN, we saw at Dobie tonight was weird weird weird. I can't decide if I liked it at all or not -- it was really disturbing when they showed her cutting herself. It reminded me of Kate when she did that the one wednesday I called her. She was so upset about Brad -- boys are dumb. I don't know why we fall for them so easily. I mean it's got to be our need of acceptance and the comfort/warmth they bring when they hold us, but I can't imagine finding a guy who will actually care about me and not just want to feel me up. I mean really -- what's going on in their heads (or most likely, pants) that makes them so desensitized to us. Josh is wonderful -- the way he told Catherine he loved her the first time, the way he just spent 600 dollars on her for her birthday -- I'm so jealous, I don't know what to do. It's dangerous having him as a best friend -- he is just so damn wonderful. I mean, really, any even remotely smart girl would fall for him in a freaking' heartbeat!  Sometimes I can't stand it. He hasn't written to me since I've gotten to school. I'm not a happy girl/camper. I know he is getting ready to go on his nature expedition/survival trip, but why hasn't he had a chance to write me yet?  I've been waiting for him to write me, but maybe he is just waiting for me to write so he can respond. I'll write him this weekend anyway, along with Emily, Mary, Caleb and Edward. I have to get my hollow core door too. I don't even know where to get it -- I'll ask Zara tomorrow. I'm going to have to get online to find directions to a Home Depot or Lowes. I hate not knowing my way around -- it totally sucks -- that's why I loved Beaumont so much -- it was small enough to where I knew where most of the big things were. And if I didn't know where they were, it wasn't that hard to find it. Here there are massive highways, freeways, loops, overpasses -- all designed to confuse and terrify the new-to-Austin driver. I wish Russ and I were okay enough that I could ask him to take me to do my errands after church -- oh well. I still don't think I'm comfortable enough to be around him. I'm cold. It's weird that I haven't slept under my covers for the last week. I've just slept under a fleece blanket on top of it. My time is almost up -- Good night my dear diary assignment. I hope you go over well. I'm exhausted, and I can't wait to turn out the lights. I have to get up in 6 hours -- ick. ",0
2024,"My computer is spiffy. I decided to name it Mara, which means bitterness"" apparently, but I was naming it after a character in the Star Wars books who is really cool. My computer gets in ""fights"" with a friend's computer. We type to each other over AOL instant messenger about what are computers are supposedly doing to each other. She named her computer Screwtape after a demonic character C. S. Lewis developed. It's hard to write stream of consciousness things because my brain works much faster than my fingers and by the time my fingers catch up, I'm on to a new thought. I'm also kind of a perfectionist in my typing because I hate to spell things wrong and make grammatical mistakes. However, I probably won't be able to keep myself from making such mistakes because I am typing so fast. One of my friends is IMing me, but I can't respond because I have to do this for an entire 20 minutes. I'm only at 4 minutes 50 seconds right now. I guess I can keep him waiting. He is one of the best friends you could ever have. However, I'm having a little trouble right now because he and I are slightly attracted to each other and he and my best girl friend just broke up and I know she still adores him completely. Besides, I think they're much better for each other than he and I could be. He and I are both too proud and arrogant. She is proud, but she doesn't think she knows everything. She is pretty zany. I met her back in the 6th grade and we've been friends ever since. Our friendship has had its ups and downs, but it has never halted. I just couldn't hook up with her ex-boyfriend because that would be tacky, at least for the next couple years. I know she had be really upset and I could never forget the way they were together. Fortunately, I think the boy is on somewhat of the same wavelength as me. Speaking of romantic interests, there's a boy who lives next door to me who's pretty attractive. However, I think a lot of girls are attracted to him, so I would have a lot of competition, and I don't like competition. He seems like a really nice guy, though I'm thinking right now he is somewhat of an idiot. One of my suitemates was hosting a drinking party, and apparently he came. I was locked away in my room, attempting to study because I have a quiz and a test tomorrow (actually later today, since it is now after midnight). I wish I could find a guy who wasn't so emotionally messed up or low in the self-esteem department that he feels he has to drink his cares away. Speaking of which, Chris hasn't e-mailed me back. He and I got into an argument and he avoids too much confrontation, though he has a tendency to inadvertently start it and keep it going. So anyways, right now he is avoiding me. I wish he would talk to me, because he is one of the few people I trust to be honest, moral, and to steer me from harm. And I need to talk to a guy like that right now. I seem to attract guys who aren't particularly moral and who tend to be too apathetic to care about making themselves better people. The irony is, they like me, they tell me, because I'm so moral, pure, and sweet. Someone's knocking at the door. It took only 30 seconds to answer it. My roommate just returned from finishing a computer science assignment in the computer lab. She is really cool, probably one of the best possible roommates I could have. She is quite eclectic. She likes to knit, particularly when she is listening to lectures because it keeps her hands busy. If I have enough energy, I fidget during lectures. I used to play with a hacky sack in high school. Some of my teachers would actually play catch with me with it. It was cool, because my teachers trusted me. I even was friends with a few. I went to lunch with a few of them about a month ago. I'm going to miss them. Speaking of which, I need to e-mail Mr. Karnavas, my former Bible/Philosophy/Greek teacher. ",0
1242,"Coming to this first year in a totally different new atmosphere for school, I knew there were many challenges. I think of the freedom of the lifestyle I'll be in as well as the work that I have to put into in getting the grades like how I did in high school. Wow, what a difference in lifestyle. I can come back to my dorm and go back to sleep after one class instead of having to go through a whole day like in high school and then finally going home and sleeping. But, its not like I don't sleep during class anyways. The ethernet connection here as had me in awe. After many years using my mediocre 33. 6 modem, the ethernet connection has been a blast. This is the first time I actually had to do an assignment online and send it online. so that's quite a change as well. I'll find that I might do less writing now, now that there are computers to do the writing for us. Living in the a dorm and around your peers usually lets u see any internal problems closeup when it happens. I've seen this already. It's not like everyday school life when you go home and ponder about the issue and go back to school the next day to see it again, or have to go on the phone and talk about it. Here, you meet the issues face to face usually, depending on where your peers live. You and your peers will get used to how each other lives, the way they eat, sleep, or drink. I'll see how I will get through this year  ",0
1494,"This is very odd trying to track my thoughts by doing this. All I can think of right now is I can't type as fast as I think. I am slow at typing in general but this makes it even harder. So lets see what do we talk about. Today I have a long day cause I have four classes and I don't get home until late. Mondays and Wednesdays are my longest days. Anyways, this weekend my goal is to be caught up with all my reading and all the things I have to do for my classes. I have been enjoying college so far but I don't like the work aspect of it. There is just so much reading and constant memorizing and remembering it. It wasn't like this in high school but then again I am not in high school anymore. Let's see what else. My roommate spelled rice all over our room carpet just a minute go and now the room smells like Chinese food. She cleaned it all up but now the rug is greasy. So after I finish typing I will clean the carpet so it's not so greasy anymore. I am looking at the clock and I only have been typing for 5 minutes. I am tired already of this. I am looking at my little cousins' pictures right and I miss them very much. It's lonely here in college but I am working on having fun. But there doesn't seem like a whole lot to do that doesn't involve alcohol in some way. Everyone seems to just want to get junk and pass out and not even remember what they did the night before. I am not much of a drinker and certainly not to the point of getting junk and passing out. I like to just go out with friends and hang out and talk like we used to, but most of my friends are so spread out that we have to do the email thing for now. I like email because its' just wonderful. There are no long distance charges and you can send it in a second to anyone anywhere in the world. Oneday people are going to not be able to remember their lives before email. I don't even think they can now. I still can because I was just a freshman in high school when it first started getting popular. But I still like the days when we were not so technology driven. I like the later 80's and early 90's. Though I am not that old I can still remember those times where things didn't seem to be so fast paced. And now everyone is trying to be millionaire and wanting more and more of material things and just wanting to have a ""good time"" and not really caring in depth about things and people. Its just use and get ride of the next day. But then again there are other people who don't do this. I don't know. Now I am looking at the clock and seeing that I have been typing for fifteen minutes now and my fingers are getting really tired. I am glad I ate before I did this cause then I really would have been annoyed with this. Looks like it's going to be another hot day. I want it to cool down but I don't want it to rain when we have to go to class. It can rain on the weekend but not while we have to go to class cause that would cause more headaches. Anyways, I just want to be home right now. I want to be in my car and drive to the mall or just whatever. I miss being at home and I didn't get much of a summer this summer cause I was so busy preparing for college and making a list of things to buy and packing, and going and being in camp and just lots of stuff that I needed some more time of relaxation and enjoyment. Will I have about one more minutes of typing so I guess this is it. I don't know what I am even saying. Oh there I hit the 20minute mark ok I am going to stop typing now, goodbye. ",1
1370,"Here I am at UGL with Hyojin and Lois. They are both doing their homework and studying. All I've done since I got here is waste my time and distract my friends from doing their work. I should be doing my reading for tomorrow, but I keep procrastinating, so I decided to finish my assignment for Psychology instead. There is so much reading to do in college. It's kind of over whelming, but I guess it's all about time management. I can't wait until the weekend. Not for any particular reason, just because the weekend is the best and most relaxing part of the week. Oh, and also, I'm going back to Dallas this weekend with my brother. It's my mom's birthday. What should I get her for her birthday? I asked her and she keeps telling me not to get her anything for her birthday, but I'm pretty sure that translates into ""get me something good. "" Actually, that would be me. Mom's not really like that. Maybe I really shouldn't get her anything. I don't know, I don't think she's going to have a very happy birthday though. Especially after the news she heard about our cousins. What is wrong with my uncle? Why is he abandoning his family like that? I think my aunt might have asked my mom for money. Oh well, I guess my parents will figure something out. I wonder where my friends went? They just disappeared. I guess they both left while I was writing this thing and now I'm left all alone. Maybe I should eat some of those Goldfish. No, I cannot. I vow not to gain the ""freshman fifteen"". I'm tired. I wonder if I'm even doing this assignment right. I hope so. I really want to do well this semester. Yea! 4. 0! Well, we'll see. Psychology's such a big class though. I wonder if they're going to go through and read each one of these. Probably not. Actually, I think the professor was saying that they weren't going to. So I could just write a whole bunch of nonsense and I guess they wouldn't even notice. My sociology professor cusses a lot. I don't really mind, but every time he does it, I'm kind of taken aback. Sociology's actually really interesting. More interesting than I thought it would be. Maybe I should be a sociology major. Maybe not. I need to hurry and declare my major. I feel so lost as a Liberal Arts undecided student. Actually you know what though? All my classes are kind of similar. Maybe it's because they're all sciences but they're all talking about scientific method and random sampling. Maybe that's because it's the beginning. My friend came back. She took a long time. I want to talk to her and ask her where she went, but I can't until I finish recording my thoughts for psychology. My gum is getting really nasty, all soft and about to dissolve. I feel like my teeth are rotting. I should really stop chewing gum. I feel like my jaws are expanding. I heard that somewhere, that if you chew a lot of gum, your jaws will expand. Where did I hear that? Oh well, time's up. I hope I did the assignment right. ",0
18,"     Well, I feel good about the fact that I am getting this assignment done  well before it is due. Today is one of those days that I feel really  motivated to do my homework, as opposed to those days in which I don't   do anything worthwhile. The excitement of college is starting to wear off and I think that the reality of the fact that I am here is finally sinking in. I really hate the way this typing field doesn't automatically move the sentence down to the next line! I really don't seem to be thinking about anything  interesting right now. I am just feeling average, not extremely excited or  unhappy. I really cannot think of anything to type. I think my mind is clearing  itself like it usually does when I sit down to right a paper. No stray thoughts seem to be coming to me. I am fairly excited about this psychology course. I think this course will not only be very interesting but helpful as well  because I plan to go into medicine. Boy, this twenty minutes is going by slowly. I think I might be typing too much too fast. Perhaps I am supposed to sit and wait till a thought comes to me before I type. I have tried to type in my current thoughts and feelings. My roommate is typing on his computer as well, annoying. Now he has turned on his fan, which is fairly loud . he switched it off. Still no  stray thoughts. I guess composing these sentences are thoughts. This assignment  is all I am thinking about right now. Four minutes to go. Three minutes to go. I have to go out and buy an answering machine today. I have to get back before nine  so I can make the upper East Jester floor meeting. Free pizza will be there! I hope its Double Dave's. Oh, they have good pepperoni rolls, I don't know about their pizza. Well, it has been 20 minutes.   ",1
478,"I am thinking about my roommate who got the wrong book for his Japanese class and didn't realize it till he tried to do his homework last night, he had to get up this morning and drive to get the book and try to do the four pages in the book that were assigned for homework before class started. He is crazy, he and I always get into trouble like that. We've known each other since elementary school and have had some great times. One time I remember we were studying for a chemistry test our sophomore year in high school, it was really late so we decided to go to the store and get some jolt cola to help us stay awake. I ended up backing my truck into the ditch in front of the store and we were stuck. We sat there forever trying to get my truck out of the ditch and then finally I called another one of my friends who had a four runner. He took us to Wal-Mart and we bought a tow strap. We  went back to the ditch and hooked our two cars up together. He then tried to pull my truck out and his tires just spun around and around. So I had to accelerate and my roommate had to push my truck from behind, by the time we got my truck out of the ditch it was like 2 so we were way to tired to study, so we  went to bed and failed the chemistry test. I ended getting a 79. 4 in chemistry and being moved to the academic class because of 1/10 of a point. If it was for  my roommate coming up with the great idea of going to get jolt cola in the middle of the night I might have been able to stay in chemistry honors, but even if that was the case I would much rather have that memory than an extra point on my high school gpa. My roommate and I now live in a two story townhouse that is 1180 square feet. We got a really good deal on it because the week before school started the apartment complex we preleased with called and said that had no apartments left for us even though we preleased 4 months ago. We had to drive to Austin and look for  a new place that weekend and while we were here we stopped by the leasing office and talked to the people there, they said that someone cancelled on a townhouse and that since we had to go through all this trouble we could have it for almost the same price we were going to pay for and apartment about 3/4 the size. We got so excited and I am really glad things worked out like they did because I don't think I could live in a small apartment cause I need  a lot of space or I go crazy too much space makes me crazy too but only when there is no one to share it with. But our townhouse is just the right size and its nicely furnished because both of my parents have been  divorced and remarried so there is a lot of furniture that no one uses, so I got some pretty nice stuff. There aren't many decorations in the townhouse but there are lots of dishes and silverware. I took my stepmom's couches which really surprised me because I didn't think that she would let me have them because sometimes she is strange but I guess she can be pretty understanding sometimes. I used to hate her but now I realize that she really does want the best for me and only gets frustrated cause she raised her kids differently than my dad raised me. ",0
1459,"How do we know that everyone is seeing the same color. We all call colors by the same name because we are taught that as children, but do we all see the same thing? When I look at something that is red I know what I am seeing, but I have no idea what someone else is seeing. They could be seeing what I know as the color brown. I am sure that there is some piece of scientific equipment that could prove this theory wrong, but it is still an interesting concept to me. Seeing something through someone else's eyes is impossible. I have no idea how others see the world. If the color theory were right seeing something through someone else's eyes would give an entirely new aspect of things. Red trees, orange apples, the Texas flag would be completely different. It is easy to say, no that's a stupid idea, but if you really think about it it is fascinating. People always use the argument that we call colors by the same name. ""What color is that? Well, its brown. Well I see brown too so your theory is wrong. Not so fast. When we were learning the color names as children we all learned the same names. When someone held up a card and said, red, that is the name that you gave that color in your mind. There is no proof that everyone saw the same color. I do not think that this is actually the way that things happened, but it is interesting nonetheless. I would like to know how this theory could be proven wrong. Just like I would like to know how they can prove that certain animals are colorblind. They cannot see through that animal's eyes, how do they know what it sees. Some animals certainly are colorblind, like the deer. You can wear bright orange when you hunt deer and they do not notice, so they are obviously colorblind. Who is the first person that figured that out? They were either really stupid or really smart. I would never think about wearing bright orange to hunt an animal. I'm sure that's not the only test there is to see if an animal is colorblind. There has to be a scientific way to prove it. My 20 minutes is just about up and I have run out of things to say. This is kind of a weird assignment. It will be interesting to see what kind of application this has. I actually enjoyed writing this paper. It is a lot easier to write when there are no set guidelines. ",0
1907,"I'm at my grandmother's house and it's pouring rain. I was supposed to go to this meeting for the Texas Sweethearts but since it's raining I'm not going to go. Even though the social events aren't required its going to bug me all night wondering if the current sweethearts are going to hold it against me. Even though I know other people probably won't go I still feel like I will stick out as not going and I don't know if that's a good or bad thing. I really don't know. I couldn't be any more tired. I waited in line for 5 in a half hours to get a ticket to the Texas-Ou game. It was so chaotic. It's amazing to see how much people will pay for those tickets. Some people were going as high as $300 for one ticket that they sell for $75. Luckily I got one and I'm so happy. I had to go to work after that and it felt like I had just gone swimming because I was drenched in sweat. I looked so bad and I went in 2 hours late. I thought I was going to get fired. I'm going to stay at my grandma's house since it's  raining, I wonder what I'm going to wear?  Why do I care so much?  People go to school looking ten times worse than me and no one cares, but I can't get myself to go to school without makeup. I wish I wasn't so self-conscious. It's weird, you always think you look fine until it comes someone else's turn to judge you than you get nervous about what they think. Who cares?  That's how I wish I could feel. Even though I wear sweat shorts and t-shirts to school I still care if they match or I wonder if I wore it last week. Why can't I stop caring about what people might think about me?  I bet no one even pays attention to me. I really don't know if I'm vain for thinking that people look at me or insecure because I care if they do. I can't believe my boyfriend hasn't called me yet. I met this girl yesterday at the sweetheart meeting and she seemed so cool. We talked and got along and she drove me to my car and we were going to go to the social together. When I called her though she didn't seem the same she was just like Oh, it's you or I don't know. Maybe I expect to much out of people. It just seemed to me that she was being fake yesterday by the way she was acting towards me today. I can't wait until time is up, but it actually hasn't seemed that long. I didn't really think this would be this easy. I guess you can tell things to a computer and it won't tell you to shutup after you complain to much. I WONDER IF I SHOULD READ FOR MY Class tomorrow?  I feel so exhausted like I haven't slept in days and today wore me out. I feel like I could sleep for three days. Hopefully pretty soon I'll catch on to this whole college thing. I have exactly 45 seconds and I really don't know what to write so I'm just going to say that I am SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO happy that I got a TExas-Ou ticket again because it the best thing that has happened in a while.

605,"I do have spells of concentration where I can get things accomplished, and I guess getting around to doing this assignment is one of them. I don't know what happened to me in the past couple years of my life. I grew up as a bad girl--always in the corner in elementary school, only girl in my crowd to be suspended, first girl to try ""new things. ""  But in the middle of my sophomore year in high school I came into contact with a few people who made me WANT to change my lifestyle. I lived in the Dubai, United Arab Emirates from 7th grade until the middle of my junior year. I went to a small, elite private school, The American School of Dubai, where I was known by teachers and parents (and everyone knew everyone in our community)as strange and, therefore bad. My attitude was ""screw them"" because I was angry at the world and dissatisfied with society. mind you if you really know me you find I am generally a good-natured person who looks for the best in people if they have anything to offer. And this is what my sophomore English teacher did. she was an amazing women, beyond intelligent, down to earth, somewhat of a cynic, hilarious, but very tough. a lot of students hated her at first but eventually realized she was doing it for your own good. But if you acted stupid she treated you like you were. But she treated me with respect straight off and I was slightly stunned. it sounds cheesy but she made me want to work to prove to people I had ""what it takes"". I was always told I had potential and I knew I did. she made me see my strong points of analyzing literature and writing and from then on I wanted to do well in school. by no means did I become a bookworm. I had fun but also made straight A's in all honor/AP classes and I realized how easily it came to me and I was content. two years later, a year and a half after I moved back to the States, I actually got to see the recommendation she wrote for my college applications, although I wasn't supposed to. I think I cried. it was the first time someone who took me seriously enough to write and let people know that I was one of the few people who had actually touched HER life. god knows she touched mine. now I know what I have to offer even if other people don't. but lately things have become overwhelming and I feel like my hold on my life is slipping. I just hope I do decently in university. I know I can if I try but I feel no motivation. I have no energy to kick my brain in gear. and it makes me sick. but I do have hope and deep down I know I can get over it. I realize I have hit a rather shallow, false part of life and I hope my interest in learning will give me a fat kick in the rear. ",0

It's definitely not what I was aiming at. I don't know what's wrong though. I set aside a lot of time to study, but I could just never pull through on tests. Some people suggested I have ADD. I always think about whether or not I have ADD. I've usually dismiss the possibility that I do, because that might be just the easy"" way out. What if it's not ADD?  Just me having bad study habits. I don't know. I always worry about school. 'm going to see a counselor about it. Crew. I can't wait 'till tomorrow morning. We have another practice with Texas Rowing Crew bright and early in the morning. 5:30 practice that is. I found seven people that are trying out for crew too that are living in my apartment complex. In one building over no less. Heather just left. I just got back from dropping her off. Heather's my girlfriend of 2 yrs going on 3. She plays goaltender on the St. Edwards girls soccer team and is having a tournament in Oklahoma for the weekend, getting back late Sunday night. Charles stopped, and is now watching television in the living room. I think that is one reason I can hardly get any studying done in this apartment. There are too many distractions. Plus my bed is so comfortable. Having to wake up so early sort of makes me tired. I learned today that people with a regular sleep cycle tend to have better concentrations than do people with a sporadic sleep cycle. That's what I have. On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, I wake up at 4:30 and on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday, I wake up at 7:30. I never gave much attention to my sleeping habits, but now I'm taking a study strategies course that is hopefully going to help me make better grades. I want to make straight A's this semester because in doing so, it will raise my G. P. A. to a 2. 7. Still no where near where I want to be, but its a start in the right direction. 10 more minutes. Speaking of sleepiness, I am feeling very, very sleepy right now. My eyes are getting heavy and my head is tilting. But I'm fighting it because I am in the middle of an assignment. I just looked at Professor Pennebaker's old tests and I do not remember going over some of those things in the book or in lecture. I hope that there was a different curriculum last year. Psychology is the only class I'm all too worried about. I feel like I have no control in this class. I feel like this class overburdens me. I'm used to reading material and having the professor reiterate what I had just learned. I guess that's something about college everybody has to learn. I just don't want to learn it the hard way. So I'm starting to form a study group. I really think these will help a lot. Although I hope the other people in the group are not thinking I'm using them for their notes. I'm not a good note taker, and I'll probably want to copy them from them. I also formed more study groups in each of my 4 classes. I'm a 12 hour student. That's another thing that gets me all depressed. I feel I might have clinical depression. It's something I'm checking out with a counselor next thursday. Four more minutes. I'm getting even more and more tired than ever. I will definitely nap after this writing assignment. My glasses are bothering me and my throat is so dry. My brain is going on hold for a second as I take a swig of water. Ok. I bought one of those Nalgene water bottles. What's the deal with those anyway?  They make them so expensive, and I see everybody has one. So, naturally, I had to get one for myself. Two more minutes. I am counting down this assignment to be over because I'm just that tired. I am assuming their will be some sort of punishment to press the finish button early, so I stop myself from doing that. Wow, 50 seconds. I am very ready to take a nap. 30 seconds. Almost there. Man, I'm going to have to get Charles to shut that TV up when I  ",1
937,"I am bored, I don't know what to write. I think that I am going to enjoy college. I miss my friends and family from back home, but I am starting to mak new friends here. I will probably go home to visit this weekend for the labor-day holiday. If I do go, I want to make sure that I will have plety of time to rest up, because last time that I went I didn't really get mush time to sleep, so I was pretty tired on my way back. I have been tired all week long now. I went to bed after midnight last night and then I had to get up this morning at five so that I could go do the PT test for the airforc ROTC. We didn't even do anything except count how many reps the upperclassman did. I wish that we could have worked out too. I really hate it while I am doing it, but afterwards I feel pretty good. Tuesday, when I got done with my PT test, I started throwing up on the field. I was pretty tired from the push-ups and the sit-ups already and didn't quite catch my breath yet when I had to start the two mile run. My time for the run went up a minute. I will try to get that back down. I want to be able to max out the push ups and the sit ups by the end of the semester. I want to get as fast at the run as well, becase if you max the run, it is worth twice as much as maxing the pushups or situps. But I care more about those than the run. I need to make up an excercise schedule for the ROTC. I don't really know when I want to do everything. I will probably just do pushups and situps in the mornings before class. Since I have to wake up at five on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I usually wake up pretty early the other days as well. I will just do those excercises and then do my homework. in the evenings, I will go downstairs to the little gym that is here in my dorms to work out. That should be plenty of excercise. I will probably not be able to do it all of the time though. I wanted to start doing the pushups and situps in the mornings this week, but I barely have enough sleep to wake up and go to class much less to work out. I think that I will like it in the Air Force. It doesn't look like I had thought that it would be. They were saying that they weren't allowed to yell at people in their faces like they always have on TV. It looks a little more respectable that the Army. I hope that I will like it. On Tuesday, two cadets each recieved a 2000 dollar scholorship. I want to find out what they had to do to get them. Someone said that to get it you have to have a 4. 0 GPA. I'll bet that there is more to it than that. But I want to try to get a 4. 0 anyways. If I have to get a loan, it will look better. It will also make me more elligible for scholorships. I am going to need the money. NExt year,   I think that I will get and apartment or an efficiency to live in. I think that I would like that more than living in a dorm. It is too noisy here. My roomates are nice, but they like to stay up late, and I always have to get up early, so it irritates me a little bit. I know that they aren't trying to be loud, but when I am dead tired, and they have a bunch of friends over, I just want to scream. But next year I will have my own place by myself. That will be nice. The only problem will be that I will have to cook for myself. I don't really know how to make anything except for scrambled eggs, macaroni and cheese, and breakfast cereal. That probably won't be very nourishing. I will probably need to get a roomate that likes to cook or something. Maybe Melinda and I could move in together and she could cook the food and do the dishes while I go to school. She could also babysit in the apartment to make some extra money. But I don't think that there will be enough money for us to do that. I would really like to help her out, but I don't have enough money, and in the past, every time that I helped her, it just ended up costing my a lot of money, and then after a week or two, she would be back in the same situation, needing my help again. It was very irritating, also. Still, she is a very good friend that I know will always care for me. She is very nice. I just don't think that she is very good handling money. But not everyone is good at that. She is very good with kids, and I'm not very good with them at all myself. I never know what to say to them. I start off talking about cartoons and stuff like that, but after a few minutes, I run out of stuff to say. My cousin Dillian liked me pretty much though. My mother was telling me about how he was so excited that I always made breakfast for him in the mornings when he was over. But I was pretty bored when I was watching him. I couldn't always understand what it was that he was saying, and for the last day,all that he wanted to do was make ice cream out of play-dough and for me to pretend to eat it. It wasn't too bad the first time, but he did it for about a half hour. ",1
1658,"Right now, I am trying to figure out how I can sign up to volunteer at the Metz Elementary reading program because I cannot get in touch with the coordinator. Anyway, I think that something must have happened to her because she has not responded to me. Now I am wooried about where I am going to volunteer and get my hours by the due date. I am watching TV and thinking about the studying that I have to do for my classes. I am trying to find a way to feel involved in this university and make my mom think that I am doing okay so that she will not worry. I am worried about my mom, sisters, and brother because I miss them terribly. I do not want to wish away the time that I have here but I think that I am feeling like there is nothing familiar around me that I can recognize. I feel a lot more calm these days, and I think that since the long session has started I feel a lot more useful and busy. Mostly, I am worried about making good friends because I feel like the friends that I left are still my real friends and that I am on some sort of vacation. I want to have a good future at this University with good classes and good friends but I think that I am doubting my ability to succeed. I wish that I could bring the people that I care about around me every once and a while because I did not realize that they were part of the strength that I had to live my life. I think about my grandmothers a lot lately, what they would have said about me being in college, and how they would have wanted me to enjoy myself and not to worry. I think that I am in a constant state of speeding up and slowing down because I do not want to get too excited about something because I may become dissapointed or upset. I think about potential disasters that could occur in my life and am always second guessing the decisions that I make. How can I be the best person that I can be without scaring myself into anxiety. I wonder about all of my friends, and what they feel like, and how they are doing and if they feel the same way. I worry that I will not feel as secure as I did at home in this big place, but I know that if I just give it time, I will feel like I belong. I am constantly aware that God is in control of my life and that I need to learn what God is trying to teach me and lean not on my own understanding of my life. I worry that I sleep to much, but I do not feel tired in the daytime, however I guess that it is necessary to get enough rest. Mostly, I feel void of emotion because I miss my mom so much. I do not feel that I took her for granted when I lived in her house but I miss seeing her persistance, and love and support. I am learning to be my own support. I wonder if she is as lonely without me as I am without her. It was a comfort to be in the house with her at the end because she was feeling much calmer and in control of ther life. I am excited to be here, and I want to count the blessings that I have because of the many people that want to be here. I want to learn to depend on myself, and not feel like the things that I want are not right for me because I am trying to learn that what I want is right for myself. Oftem throughout the day I doubt the things that I do or the feeings that I have,  ",1
2150,"I REALLY DON'T KNOW OR THINK THAT I HAVE HAVE ANY CHANCE OF FINISHING COLLEGE. I FEEL SOMETIME THAT THE ONLY REASON I AM HERE IS FOR MY PARENTS AND FAMILY AND THE SATISFACTION THAT I WILL FEEL WHEN THEY ARE ALL TOGETHER AT MY HOUSE FOR MY GRADUATION PARTY. I PERSONALLY FEEL THAT COLLEGE IS A OLD WAY OF THINKING. I FEEL THAT ONE IS BROUGHT UP TO BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW A CERTAIN TRACK IN LIFE ALL TO OFTEN. WITH THE WAY THAT THE ECONOMY IS NOW AND THE WAY THAT JOB SECURITY IS, I FOUND IT HARD TO BELIEVE IN THE BELIEF THAT ONE SHOULD GO TO COLLEGE GET AN EDUCATION AND GO OFF INTO TO WORK FORBE AND WORK THERE WAY UP THE COPORATE LADDER. A LADDER THAT HAS BEEN LAID OUT BY PEOPLE WHO HAD THE KNOWLEDGE TO KNOW THAT IN MOST CASES COLLEGE AND THE EDUACTIONAL SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO TRAIN OTHERS TO BECOME PRODUCTIVE WORKERS FOR OTHERS. I FEEL THAT THE SMALL AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WHO DO BECOME FINACIALLY SECURE AT THE LEVEL I SOMEDAY WISH TO BE UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU WANT TO MAKE MORE MONEY THEN OTHERS YOU HAVE TO DO THINGS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE  NORM. THE REASON EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK YOU DON'T SEE TONS MILLIONAIRES IS BECAUSE ONLY A HANDFULL OF PEOPLE HAVE THE COURAGE TO STEP OUTSIDE OF THE NORM OF SOCIETY AND DO THINGS THIER OWN WAY. THIS IS THE PROBLEM THAT BRINGS ME THE MOST STRESS RIGHT NOW IN MY LIFE. I CAN'T HELP BUT TO THINK THAT MAYBE ME THINKNING THIS IS A SIGN THAT I AM MEANT TO FOLLOW THIS PATH OF BREAKING OUT OF THE NORM. BUT AGAIN I LOOK INSIDE OF MYSELF AND WONDER IF I HAVE THE COURAGE MYSELF TO DO IT. I HAVE TRIED NUMEROUS TIMES TO STEP OUT OF THIS NORM BUT FIND MYSELF RUNNING BACK TO THE NORM FOR SECURITY. I WONDER SOMETIMES IF THIS SHOULD THIS EVEN BE A FACTOR IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW ONLY BEING 21. BUT THEN I SEE PEOPLE WHO I WOULD LIKE TO BE LIKE AND THIER LIFESTYLES AND SEE THAT THEY HAVE THE THINGS I WANT AT MY AGE AND SOME CASES EVEN YOUNGER. AM I IN FACT WASTING MY LIFE AWAY SITTING IN A CLASS ROOM FILLED OF 500 PEOPLE WHOS AMBITIONS IN LIFE MIGHT BE TO BE NOTHING MORE THEN NORMAL. I MYSELF CAN'T STAND TO BE IN THE NORM. I WANT TO GO MY OWN WAY AND DO THINGS THAT MAY BE A LITTLE CRAZY OR RISKY, BUT THEN AGAIN I GUESS THAT IS WHY I'M WRITING THIS NOW. A SAD ATTEMPT TO FILL TIME UNTIL I HAVE TO COURAGE TO DO MY OWN THING. MAN WRITING FOR THIS LONG HURTS YOUR HANDS . I BET THE BEERS WILL KILL THAT PAIN. WHY DO I DRIN K EVERYDAY. IS IT BECAUSE I FEEL I HAVE BETTER SEX AFTER I HAVE HAD A FEW DRINKS? I KNOW THAT IS WHY. I FIND MYSELF DOING THAT A LOT. WHY ARE WOMEN SUCH A BIG PART OF MY LIFE. IS THAT THE REAL REASON I WANT TO BE RICH AND FAMOUS, SO I CAN GET ANY WOMEN I WANT? WHAT MAKES ME THINK THAT I CAN'T GET THOSE WOMEN KNOW. WHY DO I FEEL ASHAMED WHEN I TALK TO WOMEN NOW ABOUT MY MAJOR AND HOW I REALLY DON'T HAVE A HIGH PAYING MAJOR. I GUESS I COULD SAY I'M WAITING TO BE A SELF MADE MILLIONAIRE BUT HOW MANY PEOPLE SAY THAT. WHAT IS THAT SMELL. DAMN MY ROOMMATE STINKS. WHY IS HE SO SHORT, WHY DOES HE HAVE A SEVERE CASE OF LITTLE MAN SYMDROM. I THINK HIS GIRLFRIEND WANTS ME. DAMN I SOUND LIKE A NIP TUCK SHOW GUY. THAT WOULD BE A COOL JOB. BUT TO MUCH SCHOOL FOR PLASTIC SURGEN. I REALLY NEED TO STOP DIPPING COPENHAGEN. I WONDER IF SOMEONE IS GOING TO READ THIS. IF THEY DO I WONDER WHAT THEY WILL THINK. MY ATTENTION SPAN SUCKS. I KNOW I HAVE ADD BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO TAKE THE TEST, BUT ILL TAKE THE MEDICATION. WHY DID I DO SO MANY DAMN DRUGS IN HIGH SCHOOL. HIGH SCHOOL MAN THAT WAS FUN. DRINKING BEFORE SCHOOL. XTC DURING SCHOOL . MAN WE WERE A CRAZY CREW. I'M HAPPY I STILL TALK TO LIKE 70 PERCENT OF THE OL BOYS AND GIRLS. ITS COOL HAVING GOOD FRIENDS , EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE A FEW. I WONDER IF THEY LOOK UP TO ME FOR BEING ABLE TO DRINK THE MOST. IS THAT WHY I DO? THAKS FOR THE TIME. ",0
76,"I don't know what I should be doing right now. I mean life is so complicated and strange to me. My father says I can do whatever I want to at university and he will be happy with it, but the thing is if I do what I want then he would be pretty upset with me. Hell, he would disown me. I don't know why I have to do things in order to please him but I have to. Its like I have no choice. I am just starting to get his trust back and I don't want to lose that little bit that I have. You could say that I'm destined to do what other people want me to do. That is the way that society is these days. We are all conformed to a certain structure in life that we have to follow; and if we don't conform then we are outcasts and shunned by society. The ""norm"" they call it. Why does there have to be a ""norm"". I don't see why we can't live the way that we choose and be free. Oh well, back to happy thoughts. Amanda. There is a happy thought. I wonder. I wonder what?  I don't know. I guess I wonder if it will work. I'm nuts about he she is nuts about me, but we don't get to see each other as much as we would like. I guess that is true about a lot of couples. But I still don't know. What I do know is that I want to stay together, even though everyone is talking about us. I don't care how old she is. Hell, she is only 2 years younger that me so that doesn't matter. People are just making a big deal out of it because I am in college and she is a sophomore in high school. She is still a lot more mature than a lot of people older than me. She understands a lot of things. I guess that is because she grew up in Saudi. People there are generally more mature than people here in the states. We are forced to grow up faster than people here. We lose our innocence faster, and have to learn about the world and society as a hole much quicker. Lets leave it on this note. These are strange days that will challenge our true selves. I wish I could go deeper than that but I'm not going to spill all of my guts to a computer. Later babe. ",0
1058,"I don't ever know what to talk about in these damned things, although I know that the point is just to write whatever comes to mind. Nothing ever seems worth committing to anything besides a fleeting second of short term memory. My eye itches. I wish Keith would stop singing that opera crap so I could concentrate on what I am doing. Oh, wait, this is what I am supposed to be doing. My head itches. What am I going to do about Elizabeth? On one hand, I want to be free to enjoy college life, having my own apartment, and the like, but at the same time, I wonder if pushing her away will be the biggest mistake I ever make in my life. Sometimes I kind of wish that someone else were making decisions for me, or at least the tough ones. My stomach hurts a lot, thinking about this all the time. I hope I don't get a ulcer. That really would suck. My head itches again. I wonder what Jeff is doing tonight; I should call him and see if he knows of any parties going on. I should probably take this keg shell back and get my deposit. Is Charlie here? He needs to call his mom. Oh crap, I was supposed to call my mom back. It will have to wait though. Damn homework. I wonder if I have anything else to do tonight besides this. Economics. no, Chemistry. no, Philosophy. no, cool no other homework. I wish I could type as fast as I think, that would be nice. I hope my mom isn't too mad that I'm not coming home this weekend. she'll get over it. I hope she understands though; I wouldn't want to hurt her feelings. She really is good to me; so is Dad though. I wonder if Dad is back from his trip yet; he sure is out of town a lot. Maybe he will retire soon, and live off mutual funds. He'll probably wait for Katie to move out though. I wonder if Dean will ever move out; maybe he's finally got his act together  I hope he does, anyway. I wish I could do something to help him out  if nothing else but to see where he could be, where his potential lies. I think even if I could find the words, he would not take the time to listen, or be willing to listen, one or the other. Is time up yet? No. Hmmm. what am I thinking now? All these question marks. makes me feel like the Riddler or something. I wonder if that means anything, that my ""stream of consciousness assignment is flooded with question marks. Apparently, there are still many questions in my life. Will they ever be answered? More question marks  great. So many questions, and not enough resources to answer them by. Not to mention the fact that no one can help because no one else is in the situation. I wish there were some way to link with someone  make them feel what you feel and know what you know  maybe get some reliable advice for a change. ",1
1311,"I'm watching my breath. Listening to it enter and exit my body. It is quiet. There is a bit of tension in my sinuses and my jaw is slightly tightened as well. my mind is quiet. Now I am back in pennebaker's class on Wednesday. I'm sitting in this incredibly crowded room with over five hundred students in it. Someone is sitting on the floor. Pennebaker has a microphone! The feelings of being back at school again. It is nice for this to be semester number two at UT. It's easier to get around. But still a shock to be back on campus with fifty thousand other humans after spending a month hiking in the mountains on the other side of the world. All of the traffic: cars, bikes, pedestrians, are such a foreign scene after the solitude of the mountains. Although this scene is not so different from the crowded streets of Delhi, India. My memories of the mountains in nepal continue to surface. Different parts of the trip. I remember so much so vividly. The day that ramesh and I left kag beni for jomsom and walked along the river. It was wide and roaring. The wind blew hard. At times the river bed was so wide that we could walk along the dry part of it. I hummed ""Dust in the Wind"" by Kansas feeling the immensity of this land and the tiny insignificance of my small person as I walked through it. A little bit frightening, a little bit mystifying, a little bit liberating. Now we're in Jomsom, waiting for a plane that will come and leave again without taking us back to Pokhara. We are sitting with a bunch of old Nepali men who are chatting about the dangers of the planeor so I figured, they spoke only in Nepali. I feel an odd bond with these old men that I cannot understand. They are part of me. There's a monk waiting for the plane as well and when it comes, takes some passengers and leaves us behind, he, along with ramesh and I decide to walk back to Pokhara. The stress of traveling in a foreign country that has a different perception of time is difficult to adjust to. Ramesh and I are driving on his motorbike toward Kathmandu from Pokhara. Monsoon rains have caused landslides along the road and we cannot pass. There are many people waiting to pass, including many distraught westerners. The urge to become stressed out is very strong, but I have to smile. What am I worried about? Things will work out. Now I am home, back to the fast paced society where I have spent most of my life. In the airport in Detroit, the first thing I notice is how fastpaced everything is. People all seem to be in a hurry. I practice Buddhist meditation and this helps me to focus my mind and not run off with all of the stresses and worries that are present each day. But what makes us live in this way? We move so fast that often we are not able to enjoy the life that is right in front of us. I return to the mountains. Now I am on Poon Hill. The first morning that I have seen the Annapurnas. It's really early and the sun is rising over the mountains. We're sitting on a picnic table that looks out on an immense valley that meets the grand peaks. I can sit here all day. I feel so open and expansive. Now we're in Tatopani. Ramesh, Dhundup and I are staying at a lodge right next to the hot springs which we enjoyed earlier. Now it's dinnertime and we're sitting on the patio, drinking hot tea and cold Fanta. Ramesh and I are playing chess. I don't know how to play, but am excited about surrendering my fear and trying something new. As I walked up to the table, Ramesh's smile lit up his entire face and my entire insides. As we play chess, we continue to exchange looks that are full of energy. Three weeks later, when I finally depart Pokhara, I blow him a kiss as I get on the plane. So many incredible new experiences that have molded and shaped my life in amazing new ways. When thinking about this trip, I feel open and expansive in a new way. I feel incredibly happy. I deserve to feel happy after the struggles of the spring of this year. Oh, and my time was up. Until next time! ",1

2202,"I am pretty tired today. I haven't had much sleep in the last couple of weeks. I have been working pretty hard and now with school starting it is going to be even busier. I work with the youth group at the church I go to. It is getting very busy there as well. We are really trying to get the numbers back up. After the summer the kids seemed to move away and the number of kids seemed to falter a little. Right now I am making a pot of coffee and getting ready to put in a hard day of studying. I was supposed to go to work today but there is nothing for us to do so we are staying home. We are working construction on our new church building. It is very exciting. We have to do a lot of demolition, and to help us out the fire department said they had some guys to train to breech walls. So for the last week they have been breaking through walls. It has been really cool to watch. My coffee smells really good. I am listening to some Audio Adrenaline. They are a Christian band I just downloaded. They sound pretty good, nothing that great about them though. I am switching majors this semester from Engineering to a dual major in History and Spanish, pretty drastic transfer huh?  I think it will be good. I got accepted into the UTeach program and so starting this semester I will be in an Austin public school teaching and observing. I will be in the classroom starting next week. I am very excited. My arms are getting really tired from writing so much and it has only been six minutes. I think they are going to fall off. I have a lot to do today. Since I am not working it will give me a good opportunity to catch up. I think I will be pretty far behind in this class PSY 301 because the Co-OP does not have the book(it is out of stock) They won't have it until Monday the 8th. I'll just have to read a lot next week. I need to do laundry today and maybe clean my truck. I am trying to sell my truck. It is a big beast and gets horrible gas mileage. About 10 miles per gallon. I think I will put it on Auto trader and see what I can get for it there. My coffee is done and it is calling my name. Come. Drink me. ""   I guess I will just have to wait another. oh my gosh. 10 minutes. I am losing my thoughts because my arms hurt so bad and I am really tired. I have to read six books for my History class. It's not so bad I have alreay read one of them and have started on another. The first was very boring. I think the rest will get better. This is a good song. I am also taking Chem 302 I think it will be a challenge because I don't really remember Chem 301 that well. I kind of breezed through it and didn't really learn any of the material. What other classes do I have?. I am trying to teach myself Spanish right now. It is fun. I think I can use Spanish a lot later in life. I hope to do some missionary work and maybe go into youth/college ministry. But who knows what the big guy has in store for me. College age has a lot of possibilities. I am hoping to maybe get something started this semester. I don't know how that is going to turn out but I think it will be fun. THis last summer me and a couple of friends went to Colorado did some fly fishing, landscape photography, and climbed Mt. Elbert (which is the highest peak in the Rockies @ 14,433)  It was a lot of fun. I and looking at a picture of me and my friend Chris. It is of when we went skydiving last year. That was a whole lot of fun. ""People may doubt what you say, but they will always believe what you do"". Reads a poster on my wall. I read it every day to help my fully realize how much more my actions speak than my words. I would like to be a great orator but if somebody could only know my through my life practices and not my life speeches I would want them to say that I had a heart like David "". a man after God's own heart. ""  That would be the testimony of my life. I pray that I can life according to the beliefs in which I so strongly hold. K2, Everest, Anapurna  some of the greatest peaks in the world. I someday wish to climb all of them. But we will see how things play themselves out. I think it is so funny how people grunt and groan and try to figure it all out. The things that are above. are always going to be greater than those below. And tru faith means you don't have to have all the answers. The End ",1
990,"College is so cool. This is a pretty cool campus. Surprisingly I'm really not that scared or homesick, and I'm 1400 miles away from home. I grew up in Dallas, TX. , but I moved to Minnesota when I was 11 and then to Wisconsin when I was 15. Now I'm back in good ol' Texas to stay. I have quite a few friends here so it's not like I'm alone. In fact, I saw my old elementary ""girlfriend"" the other day down on the drag. I was walking to get my books and she was in a 99 black ford mustang driving the other way. She honked the horn and waved and as I looked back to wave at her, I tripped on a pole and nearly fell flat on my face. I don't know if she saw it. i hope not. I called her up tonight to talk to her, but she wasn't home so I left a message. I said, ""it was cool seeing you the other day, but I don't know if you saw me almost fall flat on my face, it was embarrasing. I can't go out looking like that so give me a call so I can reedem myself. ""  I can't believe that the jester tv channel shows cool movies. My roomate is watching the movie Fallen right now with this girl. He says its really scary, but I just think it's weird. It's funny, I never really get scared that much by movies and stuff. I think I just tell myself that it's not real and then it doesn't bother me. That must be like psychology or something. Damn, I think about the opposite sex way too much. I love girls, I think that they are the most beautiful creatures to ever walk the face of the earth. I certainly picked the right campus for girls though. Like 70% of them are goddesses compared to the ones where I come from. Where I live now, most of the girls are big farm girls that could take me in a fair fight, and they are all polish. Polish people are so stupid . . they'd couldn't make ice because they forgot the receipe. Well, my twenty minutes are up, so this is me signing off ",1
168,"the end of this song is so weird. what was Andy on when he thought of it. now this song is pretty cool. it bumps. too bad my sax solo was gay. I think that funk is the coolest type of music. I can't believe that maceo parker is  playing at antones. I am so there. I can't believe I remembered the number man, I wish I could get rid of my damn computer virus. what a pain. my knee hurts. I so stupid for busting it. I think that my dorm room has to be the coolest in jester. jeff is such a pimp. too bad he sounds kind of white. josh is the coolest though. he's just about the funkiest drummer IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve ever played with. I don't know if IÃ¯Â¿Â½m supposed to be pressing enter, but if I don't I start writing off of the screen. I think that IÃ¯Â¿Â½m gonna like psychology. it's pretty interesting. I hope my stereo is bugging anybody. the concert tonight is gonna be cool. I just hope that I don't get killed. this song  cracks me up. I gotta leave in 20 minutes. I better have a lot of sugar to keep me awake. I can't believe how tired I was last night. maybe I should  have slept over at the girls place. I got to record my CD and send it to b. IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve gotta find out when I need to take defensive driving. these pizza rolls are so good. man, jester food sucks. the only good thing is the cereal. salads are ok. the pizza is decent too. my new hat sucks. it's really  uncomfortable. my brother is so whipped. me and my twin brother aren't really a lot alike. he is so disgusting when he's around his girlfriend. I guess that keyboarding class paid off. paid or paid. ly or lie. die or. . . well maybe not. what the hell am I talking about. this is a pretty crazy assignment. over half way done. it pisses me off when my posters fall off of my wall. CDÃ¯Â¿Â½s over. what do I want now. how 'bout a little screaming headless torsos. they are the coolest. jo jo meyer is the most amazing drummer in the world. too bad I can't go to the first game. I still gotta get that sports package. some much to do, so little time. almost done now. my mind has gone blank. IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve got to wash my clothes. if I don't do that tomorrow, IÃ¯Â¿Â½m gonna smell all damn week. IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve got to read a lot this weekend. this is boring. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m sure who ever might read this cares very little about what IÃ¯Â¿Â½m saying. oh well. looks like my time is up now. just gotta push the submit button. bye. ",1
926,"I'm really hungry. I'll have to go shopping after this. I don't know what to write. I really need to catch up on my reading today. I don't know why I always leave things to the last minute. I was going to try to keep up with things this year but I'm not doing a real goodd job. I have to do computer science tommorrow. that will be easy. I should have called darcie and megan this weekend and hung out with them. kyle should have come up too. I'm surprised I got mike to come hang out last night since he almost never leaves his apartment. I really want to go smoke but I probably shouldn't. I need to cut down. I wish I could think of a place to put these stickers. I had to kill a spider but I missed him. what weas up with all those spider questions in the pretesting. pretesting took a long time. and it seemed like a lot of pointless questions. I need to go sign up for experiments. there sure are a lot of beer cans lying around. I need to get everything cleaned up in here. I haven't finished unpacking yet. I have to go look for a job tommorrow. I wish I didn't have to work, but it will be good for me. I won't waste so much time hopefully. damn, I haven't been writing very long. I hate doing these things cause if I'm thinking about writing everything I think, then I don't think normally. I wrote think too much. there's so much shit I have to do. and I don't want to do it. I'll probably end up not doing any homework again today just cause I don't have to have it done yet. I can't wait to get out of school. I wonder if anyone will actually read this. if so, what's up. I'm getting tired of writing. I'm so hungry. I should start clipping coupons to take with me. I guess it'll make a big difference and I don't have a lot of money. I wonder what my sister's doing.  I should start taking some more pictures. I haven't really done any of that for a while. I wonder what's on that roll of film in my camera. it's been in there so long I don't know what I took pictures of. okay about five more minutes. shit. I wonder where I should try to get a job. hopefully something fun but I don't know what. I feel like I should have more written down for twenty minutes. oh well at least I did something. I don't want to write anymore. ",0
1056,"Life as a college student is not quite like how I had expected. When I was a senior in high school, I thought I was going to be a studious student having a lot fun. But two weeks into college and I'm already slacking off. Most freshman who start off college don't really know what's going on, but I guess you can say that I had an early start. This was because my older sister, Lisa, also attends UT. With this factor, I quickly started to hang out with my sisters friends and began slacking off. So what I am saying is that, if I didn't have someone that knew what was up, than I would probably be having an easier time staying on track. Maybe its just me, but that is how I feel. But I am having a lot of fun, I guess you can say. I met a few people from orientation. They are the people that I am usually with. But I am having a hard time making friends in my classes. It might be because I'm always late to class and I never get a chance to settle down before class starts, probably. Well, I'm hoping to make some really good friends here. Isn't there a saying that a person makes most of their ""life long"" friends in college? I don't know. I don't even know why I am talking about my personal life for a homework assignment. I don't know if I am even doing it correctly. I guess that I will find out when I get my grade for it. Its been fourteen minutes and I am already running out of things to say. Okay, I'm going to return to what I was talking about in the beginning, SCHOOL life. I really feel that I need to get myself prioritized. I need to catch up with all my work and get ready for my up coming tests. I really don't know what else to write and I think this is about 20 minutes, so that it. ",0
1316,"It's 11:18 at night. I'm tired, and I hate doing homework. I don't want to do homework. Homework is EVIL. Studying is evil. School is evil. All I want to do is be on the internet and surf, chat, and download. MP3s. You can never have enough mp3s. This Ethernet is so fast! I love it. That's the only thing I like about college. The computer has made me antisocial. I don't need people, just need my computer. Haven't really met and made many new friends. Why? Because I'm always in my room. Because I'm always on the computer. I choose it over other things. Things like studying. Pikachu is lonely. He's sitting on my bed all by himself. Just sits there. Jester food is disgusting. I don't like it, but sometimes you have no choice but to eat it. Nasty. Kinsolving is better. Eating in my room is good. I have better food in the closet. I mean, jester food isn't as horrible as it sounds, just that it's so fattening. Just about anything on the main course menu has over 50% of the daily fat intake. That's way too much. Worried about calculus. I hate math. Got really bad teachers for math in high school, so now I'm paying the price. I wish I had better teachers. Wish the room was colder. Still got to study tonight before I can go to bed. Got to study calculus. Have a quiz on Thursday. And a chemistry quiz too. It's so hot outside. I don't want to go out. Adding on to antisocialness. It's better at night when it's cooler. I like it cooler. The internet is so fast. I think I will live on campus next year just for the Ethernet access. Sounds like a stupid reason. But it's reason enough for me to stay. I hate working out. It's hard work and I sweat. Is the 20 minutes up yet? I don't think so, almost time. Hahah. Then I will be done with this evil homework assignment. I'm tired. I want to sleep. There's a stupid paperclip on my screen. I'm in word right now because my spelling sucks. And I don't care. The computer takes care of it for me. Told you the computer is a great great friend. Who needs real people when you have the computer? I've never eaten ants before. I don't think I want to eat insects. Survivor was a good show. I tried to watch it every week. I liked summer. Did nothing. I wish it was summer again. I got post it notes in the mail today. I am happy. Stupid people complain to me about stupid things like hurting feet. Food is good. School is evil. It's the devil! Ok! Yay! My time is up. Good bye. ",0
