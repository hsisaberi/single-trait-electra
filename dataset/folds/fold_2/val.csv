1124,"Okay, I'm not quite sure what to write. I'm sitting in the undergraduate library right now because I can't get my computer at home to get internet access. It is a pain to have to have to come all the way down here to use the computer, but on the other hand it's good because while I'm here I'm going to study some other class materials. Maybe coming to the library will motivate me to keep up with my studies. It's ten minutes until 9pm on Sunday and I can't wait to go to bed! I just got done working out and I am already a little sore. I had a good day today, I did a little shopping this afternoon, and then I got to see my parents. They were driving through Austin on their way home, San Antonio, from Fort Worth. We went to dinner and got to visit for a little while. I was happy to see them, but a little sad because the reason they went to Fort Worth was to see my grandmother, my mom's mom. She has breast cancer and isn't doing as well as we'd like. She's especially nervous today because she starts radiation all over again tomorrow. It's kind of tough to think about this because my mind starts to wander and start asking thousands of ""what if"" questions. What if she passes away? What is my grandfather going to do? How will my family survive? Luckily enough, my family is very close, so I know that everyone will find the support they need, but there is still no way to prepare yourself for these things. My mom says that she's more worried about how my two sisters and I are going to be when my grandfather on my dad's side passes. He's only 69 years old, but he has diabetes and doesn't take care of himself like he should. My body is weak right now, mainly from working out, but I can't help but notice that I feel like my body is ""sunken"" since I started talking about death. You'd think that I would talk about something cheerful, especially since I am a pretty cheerful person. I guess I just need to talk about my fears for a while. Well, the rest of my life is going well. I transferred here from Texas Tech and I am adjusting to UT and Austin pretty well. I definitely miss my friends from Tech, but I can always visit them. I'm in an incredible relationship with my best friend. Mark and I have been together for close to two years now. It's an amazing thing to find true love. It's kind of scary to think that this is probably going to be the guy I spend the rest of my life with, but without a doubt I cannot wait to spend the rest of my life with him. I feel like just yesterday I was starting high school, and here I am in my second year of college. God has given me some incredible attributes. I think I look up to my parents a great deal. They have been married for over twentyfive years and are going strong. It's an amazing thing to grow up in such a loving and supportive household. I think the most amazing part, is that the love and support does not end with my immediate family, it travels throughout my entire family: aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins. If you can't tell already, family is definitely number one in my book, and it will continue to be that way. Well, I have rambled on and on for the past twenty minutes so it is time to go study and read. ",0
856,"Well, I guess that the first thing that I want to write about is that I miss home, and my friends and the guy that I've been dating. Secondly, I've been thinking how easy this college thing is so far, but then again I haven't had any tests or quizzes yet. What else?  Nothing really, basically, it seems like I'm still not in school and that It's still summer because I can do anything that I want to, and not have to worry about anything. Everything is pretty laid-back here, and so I don't really get a chance to worry about anything. I have a schedule of events for the day. And, I'm pretty-much told when I can eat and my classes designate for how long I can sleep, so I'm set. I had an audition today for a singing group on campus, and the funny thing is that I'm not really that concerned about it. Less things are bothering me nowadays. I am concerned about money. I only have a partial scholarship, so that's a big deal to me. My parents don't really have all of that extra money to spend, so I know I'm going to have to do well this year so that I can earn another scholarship. Even that doesn't stress me out much. I've been checking my e-mail and mailbox regularly, and I wish that I were getting more mail. It makes me feel special. My parents call often, and It's weird that they miss me so much--surprising even. I am outraged that my stupid books cost so much. I'm pissed off that everyone here seems to have a boyfriend around, but I don't. This girl on my floor always has her boyfriend over, and he brushes his teeth in our water fountain. Eeeww. What else?  I don't know what I'm thinking. Mostly of whether or not anyone is ever going to read this babble, since it's only for a completion grade. And also I'm thinking that twenty minutes is a long time. My sort-of boyfriend keeps popping into my mind. I miss him more than I thought, obviously. I'm thinking of what Mr. Pennebaker said in class--that all freshman feel lonely, and that they just hide behind a masque of semi-denial. I'm thinking that I've been here a whole two weeks almost, and I haven't gotten to be friends with one single black person, which I am feeling stupid for (this pops into my head since a black girl just sat down next to me in the lab)  I came to UT expecting there to be more black students here. I figured that in a population of 48,000, there would be lots of black students. But so far I haven't been able to associate myself with any of them. Not that black people are the key people that I'm striving to be friends with, just that most of my friends for my whole life have been white because I was raised in a 90% white neighborhood and went to a 95% white school, and I want to associate with my race, and possibly learn to be more proud of it. Anyway, I was just no thinking that I guess that I didn't follow the rules because I've been correcting my errors and revising my sentences all of the way through this assignment. Okay, one minute left. On that note I'll end by saying that I am thinking that this is one of the coolest assignments that I've had in a long time, and that this class is going to be one of my favorites, I THINK. ",0
1807,"I simply don't know where to start. Having a timer count down how long i have to type is kind of stressful for me. I feel like I have to rush to write enough for twenty minutes. But then, how would the teacher know if I really did type the whole twenty minutes?  What if I was a naturally slow typer?  However, I am a good typer, so I will have plenty of stuff to write. I just got back from my chemistry class, and we learned nothing new. I am surprised at how well I seem to be understanding everything in that class, considering the fact that my high school chemistry teacher was a nutcase. I am like my current chemistry teacher because she teaches things in a nice, normal way, unlike my previous teacher. I learned about the basics more today, like density and specific gravity and all the other good chemistry stuff. On the way back home, however, I learned that my flip flops were not the best type of shoes to walk a long time in because they gave me blisters on the tops of my feet. The plastic that goes into the foamy part of the shoe made a sharp angle and kept rubbing into my skin until it was raw. I am now in pain because I was not very careful when choosing the type of shoe to wear to class. Today was the first day since I arrived in Austin that I have worn shorts. I finally gave in and accepted the fact that it's just too hot here to keep wearing jeans all the time. I felt like I was being a slob because I wore a big t shirt and cotton shorts. I felt like I should be going to the gym instead of chemistry. When I got back home, I saw some people sunbathing in the pool. I wonder why anyone would want to sunbathe now when it is already so hot and sunny all the other days of the week. How odd. I'm relieved that it is Friday--the end of the week. I can now relax and enjoy myself with my friends. Today was also a good day because I finally got internet service, which is why I chose to do my assignment today. I find myself not capitalizing any of my letters that should be capitalized because on AOL instant messenger, I don't need to punctuate or capitalize very well or accurately. My sister just got a call from a friend, and I am wondering who is calling. I really want to know but I can't ask her because she is still talking. From hearing her talk, I think the caller is one of our friends who is in her philosophy class. I am feeling a little hungry right now becuase I ate lunch at noon, and it's been a while since I fed myself. I had a few cheese nips before I started, but I regret leaving them in the kitchen because now I can't eat as I type. Oh well, that's ok because if I did eat while I did this assignment, the keyboard would get all oily and I would not be very pleased with myself. I guess I should eat after finishing this assignment. I see that still have seven minutes to go, so what am I thinking right now? I still feel the pain in my foot from my stupid shoes. I am also excited because I get to hang out with my friends this evening. I might see a movie. Speaking of movies, I am planning on seeing the Robin Williams movie   One Hour Photo   next week with my friends. I am excited because Robing Williams is a good actor, and I enjoy most of his movies. I am kind of apprehensive because it is supposed to be a thriller or scary movie. I hear my printer printing my sister's assignment, and I'm getting annoyed at it because it's so loud. I am wondering why I bought this printer, knowing that it was loud. In the Consumer Reports, it said that the printer was good, but loud, but I bought it anyway because it was cheaper than the one that I was looking at. Maybe I shouldn't have gone the cheap way. Oh well, it's a little late now. What should I eat for dinner?  I want to eat out, instead of cooking for myself because I am lazy and I don't want to make something. I want someone else to do the dirty work and me to enjoy the results. I can't wait until dinnertime, but I can't eat anymore because I have eaten too much already. I am kind of tired today because I had to wake up early to wait for the cable guy. I think I will take a break after this assignment and sleep a little. That would be nice because then I will be refreshed this evening. Yesterday, I couldn't sleep, but I don't know why that was. It might have been the outside noise from people coming and going from the parties around here. I hate the inconsiderate people who don't think about how their noise affects others. ",1
219,"As I sit here and drink this very nasty coffee. (coffee maker is on the fritz) I look back and recollect on this past weekend. In fact this has been my only thought since Monday morning. So I can give you can better understand what I am talking about, I will give you  a background premise to what occurred. I was sitting on the computer, as always, talking to my boyfriend in Houston on a chat group. He and I are still in that ""newlywed"" phase of a relationship, so we are constantly wanting to be around the other. My having to be a couple hundred miles away in school is causing major distance pains. Any way, I was trying to encourage him to come visit me for the weekend. He was regretfully working on both Saturday, and Sunday lunches ( he is a waiter, where we met this past summer) . He replied to my requests with a request for me to go down there. I thought about it for a brief moment, decided that I had no major plans for the weekend, and immediately called Greyhound. I was on the next bus home, in one hour. He was so completely surprised. As he put it, it was one of the largest signs of love that he had ever been shown, for someone to just up and leave on the spur of a moment, spend over $50 that he knew I didn't have to spend, sacrifice a weekend of my time, just to see him. He was on cloud nine, and as soon as I saw him, so was I. Well the weekend progressed, and I had a wonderful time. I also had a chance to meet up with my friends still in Houston, without having to report in to my mother. thankfully I neglected to tell her that I was in town. Well, on my last day there, before my ride to the bus station, he and I had a heartfelt conversation. He basically proclaimed his undying love for me, and told me exactly how special I was in his life. He also went over all the things that I did to let him know how much he knew that I love him. He remembered all the little things that I have done since day one. which really meant something to me cause I know that my actions are received with such appreciation. He felt that this last one, my coming to see him on the spur of a moment, was the ultimate. He then proceeded to tell me of a mental list that he had of who he envisioned his wife would be, what kind of person she would be, and what her traits would be. He told me that I fit every one, and he said that I was his perfect companion. Both of us have seen a lot, and have dated almost every type of person out there. I know that he is the one for me, I have known it for a while. I have been told that when you meet that certain someone, you will know it is them, and you will know that they are the right one for you. Well. my mind, heart and soul are screaming at me that Terrence is him. Well, I stated a few things to him that I had been thinking about, and at one point,  I started to cry, out of sheer joy at what he was saying to me, I have never had any one person ever express their feelings to me, and I don't think I have ever experienced love at this level. I was so happy that the tears just came. Oh. to explain the next thing, I want you to know that we have talked, hypothetically about marriage several times in the past. but it was usually never in a fully serious tone, only half serious. but each of us was contemplating it. When he saw me crying, he embraced me so tightly, and with such warmth I felt at totally peace, at that moment, he whispered (and I still don't know if I was meant to hear t or not) that he had ""finally found his wife"". he pulled back from the embrace, looked so deep into my eyes that it felt as if he touched my soul, and right then and there, asked me to be his wife. I was soo taken aback that I couldnÃ¯Â¿Â½t speak. I have never been proposed to, and wasn't sure how to respond. All I could do was smile one of the biggest smiles I have ever made, and I replied yes. He said that he was completely serious. no hypothetical at all. he also said that he would ask me again, but this time, would present me with a ring. I know that it could be a while before he can get up the money for that. but I am willing to wait for a man like that. I have never meat anyone quite like him. I have only been in love 2 times before. one lasted for 3 years. but it ended as an abusive relationship. the second was only a one sided love. He was leaving for the Marines, and didn't want to return the love because he knew that he would come out a different person. But both times cannot even compare to my feelings for Terrence. Now I come to my contemplations. I had plenty of time to think about my life and where it was going on the bus ride home. I know that I want to spend my life with Terrence, he and I share the same values, we are both religious people in our own ways. we may not go to church regularly, but we are both at peace with God and what He asks of us. I have never met anyone that was religious and not afraid to admit it, but he isn't overly religious to the point that I am disgusted. :O)  We both have the same values regarding marriage. in effect, neither of us believes in divorce. Marriage is for all time, and if you marry a person then it is forever. ""'til death do you part""  I know that this could work. The biggest obstacle that I can see is the age gap. he is 28, I am 18. It hasn't posed a problem for us before, my mother likes him, and sees that he shows acceptable behavior, and treats me with the utmost respect. He never belittles me, or disregards what I say because I am young. In fact he looks up to me because I have set such high goals for myself, and will stop at nothing to achieve them. He also knows that I want to wait until graduation, or at least close to it, before I get married. And he knows how important Med-school is to me. He also says that he will not marry me until he knows for sure that he can support me. he is one of those chivalrous guys, that believes that a man should be able to support a family on his salary alone. but if his wife wants to work, or even makes more money than him, then he is all for it. he just wants to be able to know that I don't have to work. At the same time, he is giving me more support about being a doctor than any other person. including my family.  One thing that bothers me is that he is 28 and still a waiter. I know that it is only temporary, he is working for a career in music, either with a band, as a musical engineer/producer, or as a teacher (he is one of the best drummers I have heard. and writes INCREDIBLE music. everything from piano pieces, to synthesized complete modern music. he can do it all!!!!  I know that with my income alone, we can make it. even starting out, being a doctor will be able to support us. The problem could arise in the fact that we will be in debt for a while, paying off med-school, and it would be a shaky start. But of course all marriages start out financially shaky. I am also concerned that because he is so much older, and more ready to settle down, that he will encourage me to marry before I graduate. that would just be another added expense. By the time I graduate, he will be 31. I just hope that he can wait that long. he says that he can, and that he will, I believe him, but he may grow antsy as the years go on.  Bottom line is that I love him, and will do anything in the world for him, but of course within reason. I also know that he would do the same for me, without even needing me to ask. I have never felt this way about any other human being. and I don't think that another love like this is possible. besides I don't want any one else but him. soo. Yes, I will marry him. and we will have beautiful children. We know that once this ""honeymoon"" feelings wear off. our love for each other will change. but as I know my love, I will still be there. by his side. I have never met anyone that completes me, and who I am, so perfectly as he does. not even my best friend. Terrence and I connect we realized this when we first met, and had our first deep discussion. In fact we connected to each other so well. that it scared both of us. and with reason. when you meet someone and the next week you can complete each other sentences. and already know what the other is thinking without them having to say a word, it can be a bit scary. But as we grew, we grew more comfortable with the idea. and now he is ready to marry me. my life couldnÃ¯Â¿Â½t be more perfect, and I couldn't be any more happier. I am in love. and now, I am engaged!! ",1
445,"of course I relize that things could be much worse. I mean this could be a real writing assingment, which would totally suck. I'm thinking about if I want to ask this guy to come to a show with me and my friend and her boy toy, but I don't knoe whether or not I will probably not. I just e-mailed my mom - I had never used e-mail before and it was quite an experience of course now I'm wondering how in the hell I'm supposed to get this little disk thingy out of the stupid computer I'm the most computer illiterate person that I know. college kind of sucks man it's not like on t. v. - it's much hotter. I freeze in my stupid room and roast outside no wonder everybody gets sick here. so anyway blah blah I have some dumb-ass roommate meeting to go to even though I just love my roommate to death and she of course reciprocates the feeling so we have no problems we're just one big happy family speaking of I miss my twin brother a lot he's in chicago at the art instite of chicago I just LOVE to tell people that because I am damn proud of him god typing sucks I've probably been going for abtou 20 minutesff saoe already opps little mistake there but its all good right>? I'm such a slow typer jesus christ this sux man I wonder what the next assignment is have a nice day man peace and love all around ",0
808,"My first thought is that this assignment is akward. This assignment is not the traditional type of work that I have done in any of my classes. But I am extremely relieved that this assignment is not difficult. I just have to write for twenty minutes straight without stopping or doing anything else. I can't believe that the weekend just came and went. It seemed like I was in class just hours ago, looking forward to the weekend. Now, Monday is already here. The long week of classes stares right in my face. But I don't like concentrating on the negative parts of life. I like to be happy; therefore, I think happy thoughts.   I am glad that the UT football team beat Rutgers. I sure didn't miss sitting in the firey heat at the stadium!  I'm glad the team is doing well. I can't exactly say that about Ricky Williams and his NFL debut on Sunday. He did okay; 40 yards in 10 rushes. That's an average of four yards per carry. But he hurt his ankle. Again!  I really think he just needs to rest up and play when there is no pain at all. I know he is a tough guy, and it must be really tough for him to sit out a game. I am just like that, except I don't get paid millions and millions of dollars to play sports!     In other sports-related news, the Houston Astros have won ten games in a row. I am really happy about that. It looks like the 'stros will be making the post-season for the third straight year. The team looks good on paper. I have high hopes, but at the same time, I do not want to be disappointed if they lose. I probably won't even worry about the play-off games too much. I will be too busy in college!   Speaking of college, I need to find me a girlfriend. This really does mean a lot to me. But at the same time, I don't want a girlfriend just to have one. I want a special one. But those are hard to find. I guess I just need to be patient and wait for that right girl to walk into my life. But I really do get lonely sometimes. That part of my heart will always be empty. That's life though; I have to learn to deal with my discomforts. Looking for a girlfriend, it doesn't help that I'm butt-ugly!  I know that my personality is great, but women aren't looking for that nowadays. They want a good looking guy. Actually, women want that good-looking guy who is extremely nice and has a great personality. Unfortunately in life, guys are either handsome or have a good personality. It's hard to find a guy with both of those characteristics. Me, I'm the good personality guy. I have faith in God, and I will leave this matter in God's hands. I guess I ended up negative anyway. But I like to be happy. I want to think happy thoughts. Right away, I think about the summer program I just did. I taught seventh and eighth graders. They come from the inner city, and they have that stereotype label placed on them. But these kids are great. They have great potential. Unfortunately, they have very easy access to negative resources. But I'm just trying to be a good role model to them. I taught math for six weeks. The progam was a whole lot of fun!  I did so much with the kids. I took them out to malls, movies, Celebration Station, UH's game room, Astroworld, an Astros game, and skating. Every single one of those was tons of fun. If you asked me to choose my funnest event, it would be a tie between all of them. But right now, I really miss those kids. It's amazing how you can become attached to those kids in a matter of six weeks. But it was fun and I hope they have an awesome school year. I know they will, but you never know with kids!   Well, I guess my twenty minutes are up. I'm now thinking about whether or not I did this assignment right?  But I enjoyed this experience. It's good to clear your mind sometimes. I'm also relieved that I finished my first assignment. On to the second assignment!  ",0
1874,"    I feel as if my life revolves around a world full of unanswerable questions. I cannot seem to find what it is that I want out of life. There are so many options and turns where I can easily decide to follow, but I am so inconsistent of what I truly feel passionate about. I wake up in the morning and step outside of my dormitory daily smelling the fresh air. Everyday it seems as if there is something I have not witnessed before. I need answers to my life. I am a person that does not go through the day easily without understanding why things are the way they are. I am a first year student at the University of Texas and I have been bombarded with hundreds of organizations and choices that will lead me somewhere in the next few years. Not only academically has this burden faced me straight on, but I am confused about a girl I have met as well. As with the hundreds of organizations, there are hundreds of girls I see in and out of my classes. Do I really want a relationship so soon? And further, can I handle a girl that is apart of the Greek system knowing that I will never have a desire in joining one in the future? It is so hard to choose a path when you analyze your choices to death. For instance, if I decide to discontinue dating this wonderful girl just because I will not be able to tolerate her constant consumption of alcohol and nightly partying with other fraternity guys, will this decision have been the most appropriate one? Or is it possible I may be a bit too judgemental of her capabilities of being a loyal girlfriend? In addition to my social life, I have to maintain some arbitrary schedule which will be beneficial for my personal needs. Like many others, I have been set loose from the world I used to know and I am on a path where I control my line of travel. It is realistic yet frightening at the same time. All my life, choices have been easy. And if I was faced with an extenuating circumstance then I always had the parental feedback to support my decision. I am creating a life. It is not just any life; it is mine. I am on my own. I have waited for this moment for a long time. And now, I do not know what to do with it. Is this normal? Have I overlooked something? Is it humanely possible to beg and plead for an entity such as freedom and once it has been acquired to not desire its power as much? I am eager for the future and ecstatic for what is yet to come. I hope I am joining the right organizations that appeal to me. I also hope I will stay academically strong as I was in high school. And further, I hope I will have made the right choice with the girl I met. I have faith that I will be led in the right direction. ",0
1912,"Right now, I'm a little confused. I'm not sure how one goes about tracking their feelings, or even focuses on them long enough while typing. I'm wondering if anyone is really going to read this. While I'm a little frustrated with the assignment, I think I would much prefer to be the one typing than whoever the poor soul is that has to read 900 some odd of these things for whatever purpose. OK. My arm itches. Now I feel stupid for typing that. I'm a little tired. It's almost 9 at night and I've been at school all day. 17 and a half minutes. I'm sitting in the UGL. I like their computers because they are much faster than mine at home. I only have dial up. Also, I like the library computer lab because I like to listen to all the clicking of the keys on the keyboards by the other people in the room. Now I'm a little self conscious that I may be hitting the keys too loud. I'm typing much quieter now. 14 and a half more minutes. I'm in a chair that rotates and rocks. I like chairs like that because I can move around. I can't sit still too long. I'm a fast mover. Even in class I'm constantly rocking, or fidgeting, or drumming with my fingers. I'm getting tense. I'm anxious for the 20 minutes to be up. 12 and a half minutes. I'm running out of things to say. This is very much like a one sided conversation. OK. I'm stumped. I'm sitting here racking my brain, but in doing so I think I'm violating the purpose of this assignment as being random. 10 more minutes to go. My arm itches again. Ha ha. I have my cell phone next to the keyboard. My girlfriend got it for me, but I hate it. It gets horrible range, and the ring is weak. It rings like an old feminine man. I'm ashamed to carry it around. My girlfriend insists, though, so I do. It's the path of least resistance. I'm better at arguing than she is, but she can argue longer, and in the end, it's her endurance that wins out. I'm swinging in my chair. I seriously hope no one has to read this. I hope this is some study about how long 18-24 year old males typically type in 20 minutes or something. My sincere condolences to whomever has the misfortune of pouring over each one of these with the intent to interpret some psychological insights. 3 more minutes. I'm perking up a little bit. I can see the proverbial finish line. I'm swinging in my chair again, but my arm stopped itching. Yeah!  2 minutes. OK. Now, I'll admit. I'm stalling. I'm holding out for 2 minutes. This is like watching water boil. What I'm feeling?  I've never been so anxious all day as I am right now. 1 minute. I'm stumped. 10 seconds. Bye! ",0
303,"Today has been an interesting day. I woke up late from a bad dream and instantly felt I was in a bad mood. Then I went into the kitchen to have a bowl of cereal and I thought I would read the morning paper the Austin American Statesman to keep up the what is going on in the death of Diana, Princess of Whales. Since I am starting out in my major right now, which is Journalism, I find it most fascinating that such a huge world story would be at the forefront of all media coverage in every medium. It seems strange that I am 29 years old and am just beginning to read the newspaper for the first time. It is somewhat embarrassing to think it has taken me this long to be interested in my professed major. I am actually studying Public Relations, but I have to study Journalism as the foundation for my study. I guess I chose PR because my dad is the Public Information Officer for the Portland Fire Bureau. He has worked there for over 25 years and I used to accompany him to work on some occasions when I was a kid. I think I liked going to the fairs where his fire prevention trailer was set up and we had displays of actual things that had been found after a fire was extinguished. Also, we would show films on fire prevention with animated characters that would appeal to other kids. I liked watching those and helping rewind the film to show it again and again. Also, I loved helping pass out junior fire fighter badges to kids as they came in and out of the trailer.  Oops!!  I just got interrupted by a phone call while typing. It was my husband's Professor that is the chair on his dissertation. Her name is Nina and I always joke with Thomas that she likes him and is trying to snatch him away from me. I don't really believe it, but I like to tease him. I know Thomas will be very faithful to me. That is one of the things I love most about him. Anyway. Getting back to an original point from what touched me this morning was the fact that I read more articles in the paper about the death and mourning of Diana, Princess of Whales. I think the articles have caused me to deeply admire the princess and the life she led that I didn't even know about before. I don't worship Princess Di, but I feel very saddened by the fact that she is now gone. The articles revealed how much she is the People's Princess and how everyone from all corners of the world are in deep distress about her death. I think to myself, wow!  What kind of person is this to touch so intimately so many lives and to cause nations upon nations to mourn her so. She did many wonderful things for the poor and she had a genuine interest in helping children and AIDS victims. She was the compassionate and humane side of people that reached out and gave others hope, not by elevating herself, but by being a servant. In some ways, I see her doing a Christian's work of being a servant and helping and loving those less fortunate. I believe it is the most wonderful thing when people have power and/or fame which demands mass attention and respect. I love it when these people use their power in a positive way to reach out to humanity and make the world a better place by showing grace, mercy, and compassion to all peoples of the world and not just the rich or other famous. I am so grateful that we still have people in this world who are motivated by the integrity of wanting to make things great instead of showing off how much power they have, or worse yet. by abusing that power for evil purposes or intentions. I am feeling very sad once again. Why is that these wonderful people who reach out and make positive impacts on us are usually plucked out of our presence at such young ages. I wish that humanity as a whole would be more on the positive side and looking for the good in each person. Why do we judge one another and value others more highly than another. I believe every human life is precious and deserves respect and dignity. I am thankful for people such as Princess Diana and for the example she has been to so many. That brings me to another reoccurring thought. Is it good enough to just be special or important to others or does one have to prove themselves worthy of esteem by his or her works. I believe we are saved by grace and not by works lest any man should boast. God wants us to recognize that He is the one in control and we will not realize how good life can be until we recognize who is the giver and taker or life and turn to Him for guidance and help in this life. So getting back to my earlier point, taking Princess Diana as an example. Some people are mad that we are celebrating or focusing rather on the death and life of Princess Diana this whole week in the media. Well, why not. she touched so many around the world personally as well as through the charities and campaigns she was devoted to. Isn't it important to take a least a week to honor her for who she was and what she stood for, like why her death has left so many people feeling distraught. Yet others complain that it is old news already (only three or four days after the accident), or people are just bored with all the coverage because after all she was just a foreign princess who didn't DO anything like make new laws or something important like that. My goodness!!!  That just burns me up that people equate how important you are by what you have produced or established. That is unfair. I think there are lots of things made, established, what have you that doesn't mean much to society as a whole. Every day there are new pieces of legislation or rules or ideas that have zero impact on me or others in the world. Why should the proposers of those things mean more to me than someone who has actually gone out and visited the sick and dying, who has given of him or herself personally for causes they believe in. I know that when we die, all we take with us our memories of relationships we've made and times spent with family, friends, or colleagues. Why is this world so focused on accomplishments that are so ME-centered than spending our time reaching out to others with help, hope, and healing. Why can't we share one another's burdens instead of always gratifying ourselves. Haven't people realized that there is no joy greater than serving others and using your gifts and talents to reach out and build up relationships has a joy unlike any other. My wish is that people will carry on Princess Di's compassion for those less fortunate and would continue the torch of servitude to give others hope, help, and healing. We could be such a strong world if we would only learn to love and serve one another.  Well, this has definitely succeeded the 20 minute allotment. I thank you for reading this, or at least for allowing me to get these things off of my chest. It has been aching in my heart a lot this past week. We need more heroes like Diana. She is an example to us all. It is so tragic that my profession of journalism is what helped put an end to the life of one so dear and so special. I pledge my spirit to use my journalism skills to expose our true heroes for the building up of mankind, not to drag it down even to the death. ",1
2171,"Trying to talk to my friends on the computer but I have to do this writing assignment. At least its easy, right? Oh well. I was bored anyways and this should keep me occupied. what am I going to do tonight. don't really want to go to southwest with kyle again. it usually turns out to be rather boring anyways. I really like this new piebald cd. its happy. I hate the keyboard on my laptop though. not very anatomically correct. I think that is the way of putting it at least. what difference does it really make though. time for new music though. piebald is only good for so long. I have rather odd taste in music, strange how much it can vary really. this time is the last time, so be here now. no reason to worry, everything will be fine. soundtrack for our movie is an excellent song. I wonder if I say that just because this girl likes it? odd how people can have influence on decisions. I need to read more. especially for school. I just can't focus and retain any of it. and then it makes me not want to read for myself, which sucks. I'm tired, I should go to sleep. but I know I won't and I probably won't get much sleep tonight which sucks as well. so much to do, so little time. its cold in my room, I should put on a sweatshirt, probably won't though. weakness of will, is that an example of it? not necessarily I suppose because there is no right or wrong in that example. but is there such thing as right or wrong, at least as an ultimate, underlying right or wrong. there has to be a determination of right and wrong in every person, with his or her own definition of it though, right? or in some instances could you just act on instinct and impulse and not have any understanding of what is the right course of action and what the wrong one is. can anybody tell me what is right or wrong, especially with no previous concept of what my ethics and morals are? no, so therefore nobody can tell anybody what is right or wrong so there is no ",0
141,"My roommate is trying to sleep, so I hope that I am not going to bug her by typing. I'm using her computer because mine is at home. I have no idea how to use the internet I need to go get my e-mail address so that I have one but I don't feel like it. I still have to get my books for two more classes tomorrow morning- I can't forget that. I miss my boyfriend- I hope he comes down this weekend cuz' I can't go up there again till he comes down to see me-I just wouldnÃ¯Â¿Â½t feel tight about it. He is such a jerk-I wish I could just meet someone else and get over him but it's so hard. I can't believe that Heather and Sebastian broke up this weekend-that's so sad. It seems so weird that relationships can totally dissolve so fast-where do the bonds you had with these people go so suddenly?  Relationships are so weird-love is weird. I would really like to meet someone that I am as attracted to as I am to Matt and that I love undoubtedly and someone who I know loves me that way, too. I would give anything to know exactly hoe Matt feels about me-why does he still have to play games with me-I f he cares about me, he should tell me-I do. I wonder what he will think when he gets that letter-I hope it doesn't freak him out-maybe I should have sent it-he's probably going to let all his friends read it and then I'll feel like a dumbass like always. I keep making mistakes and I know we aren't supposed to worry about them but I can't quit fixing them. I wonder if anyone will actually ever read this?  I wish my roommateÃ¯Â¿Â½s boyfriend and his friend would leave-they've been here three freaking days-thatÃ¯Â¿Â½s a little inconsiderate-I think and she keeps drinking all my lemonade-doesn't she realize that costs me money-I wouldnÃ¯Â¿Â½t care if she'd ask-but that is so rude, she doesn't even say thank you. That guy gives me the creeps and he just sits on our coach all day. I wish Emily and Lori could call me with their phone number-I really miss them. I need to call Cynthia, too, and see what sorority she got into. I wonder if she's seen Emily and Lori-will that all stay friends?  I feel left out-I wonder in Cynthia saw the bracelets-she will be so pissed at me if she did-I'll call her after 5. I can't wait to go play volleyball-I've got to finish my drama reading after this, too. I wonder if I am doing this right-I can't tell exactly what thoughts to write cuz some come to me while I'm writing others and then I lose them-I  need to write a poem-I've been losing so many good ideas and that pisses me off. only 11 more minutes to go. I havenÃ¯Â¿Â½t typed in along time,  I would love to be with Matt right now-I am so glad that I haven't been thinking about him as much as I did before we moved-That would kill me, maybe I'm shielding myself a little cuz I still; feel like he is going to be the first person to really really hurt me-why is it that my self esteem hinges so much on his interest in me?  That is certainly not healthy, why did I just type certainly instead of definitely was thinking defiunatle, that was an idea for a poem that I still havenÃ¯Â¿Â½t written down I need to remember that-I hope I like my poetry class-it will suck if I hate it after all the trouble I went to get in it. I'm glad that the part about my roommateÃ¯Â¿Â½s boyfriend is gone now, I'm afraid sheÃ¯Â¿Â½d walk in and read it-now she'll walk in and read this-oh well-three days is too long-I wonder if Matt will stay the night here when he comes or at t8m's house of that other guy who lives in Austin. I am anxious to go to College Station thought, but will I stay at Matt's house or at Emily and Lori's house. Will that be mad at me if I stay at Matt's. The computer just went back to the main menu cuz I guess I pushed Ctrl-whatever that menas-2 more minutes-I am so glad I didn't just lose the whole thing-I'd have been pissed beyond belief-my hands are getting tired. I have heartburn from my dada's chili still-I hate chili-why did I eat that anyway?  I can't believe Princess Diana is dead-it seems so weird-she is just as vulnerable as anyone but it never seems that way-now two princesses have died in car accidents-cars are so dangerous-time is up-Yay!

463,"I am thinking about Jason and wondering if we will get married. I am really happy but then there is Tim, who wants to get in my calculus class and my teacher is an absolute freak. what is a freak anyway I don't know but I have heard that there are a lot of freaks here. my roommate is asking me what I am doing and I want to tell her that I am typing on my computer. can't she see that? some people are just redundant. this paper is redundant and life is redundant. people keep making the same mistakes over and over and over again, and they don't see the pattern. it took me a while to see the pattern of my redundancy but now I see the pattern and I still make the same mistakes. I always make mistakes and I do the same stuff and I didn't even make a sorority and I really don't really care. I can't type fast at all now I am stealing my roommates thoughts maybe I just am really dependent on other people and I can't even think for my self. Hey sweetie? What's your name and major? I just heard my messages and they are not even my messages because I cannot think with my roommate complaining about how popular she is, I used to be popular I was so damn popular. And now I am just a number-my social security number Gone is my identity and my boyfriend and my family and my roommate is trying to sleep and I am getting tired. I wonder what you would say, yeah you, if I told you that I slept through your psychology class and don't really care about what everyone has going on in their messed up heads. I am doing this because I have to, I have to do this and I have to be responsible. I can't believe that my father yelled at me today He is lying when he says he loves me. He told me that the only person he ever loved is mom and if I am rude to her once more then I will suffer. like what is he going to do? Put me in a gas chamber or send me to jail worth no food?  I can't believe this stuff is happening to me, At the party tonight I felt miserable. I hate Jason for making me hurt so bad, I hate loving someone that is so far away. I hate the way I feel that I am missing out, but when I try to lead a normal college life I only wish I was at his house playing pool. I'm good at pool now. The holes on his pool table are smaller than average so that when I play on a real table I could really hustle somebody. Hove I ever been hustled? What all can one be hustled in? I must be the victim of some huge pimp like hustle that follows me around and lets me fall on my ass when I feel good about myself, I hate you Kevin Hogan, I hate your lies and my lies to everyone about you, I would have made it somewhere had you never kissed me and hustled me. I wish that this computer would stop beeping, Beep Beep Claire needs to sleep. ",0
1414,"I've decided to write this stream of consciousness paper on laptop going home to Houston. My brother was doing the driving so I decided to use my time wisely and write. Right now I feel relaxed going home. I still call Houston my home, although for the second year in a row I've spent 9 months of the year in Austin. I wonder if I'll ever call Austin home. Maybe only if I live here when I'm more settled in my life. What's weird is that though I am going to college with a goal, and doing reasonably well and taking courses that I myself have chosen, I still can't but help feel at time that I'm not sure where I'm going. Or if I will reach these goals. I wonder if others feel the same way. I'm quite sure they do which is probably why when the weekend rolls around six packs are brought in. I, myself, have never drank, so maybe that's why I feel that I am taking the whole impact of this college thing, so much more than others. I kind of figured out why college students feel so pressured in college and I've came up with several reasons. First, you have to study like hell to do well. Second, sometimes you can study and not do as well as you expect. Third no folks around to cry on their shoulder and then you can't because you're a so called wuss if you do. Fourth there's no tangible evidence like money to make you feel like you're going to succeed. By the time a kid reaches college level he or she wants the financial freedom of an adult but knows it way down the road. Sometimes that road seems too foggy to see down. Finally if your a momma or daddy's boy you miss that home cooking. With all that dry and dull food and on top of that mounds of homework and hours of studying to do any right person would not call Austin their home. Not just yet. We all need a safe haven to go to. Mine is in Houston. ",1
1721,"     311, I never actually listened to them. man my eyes itch. wow, Im supposed to be typing instead of talking to Arturo. Man, this song is so melodic and soothing. It reminds me of sandy beaches and sunshine. Well anyway this is college, dorms filled with all of the decor of people's personalities and homes from their towns. Sometimes I wonder why people are the way they are. It's quite complex and difficult, but I'm sure their environment had a lot to do with their personalities and social qualities. I truly believe that social qualities mean a lot. People need to understand that everyone is different and because, don't read this  Adan. The song has changed into a classical melody and by the same band, oh no, Tool. Music, is a language everyone can speak. You can't go wrong with music. It's a huge part of my life. wow, Aenima ( tool song) is redone with orchestra instruments. Aenima is an interesting song about Armageddon. Speaking of Armageddon, is God going to come to Earth, or Jesus for that matter. Biologically, we are just organisms living out our lives. And for what?  To not sin and go to heaven?  There are so many religions out there, I mean, controversy is going to be a given. Why is John reading this. Is he interested in what is on my mind. Well anyway, Respect for other's religions is something I find extremely important and essential to understand at the University of Texas at Austin. Instead of looking at a muslim and saying   holy shit what's up with that   just think to yourself how they see your religion and judge yourself. Live, and let live. Have respect. I feel as though people close to me in my home in Rockport do not realize the respect I have for them. They never realize, is this the same orchestrated song by tool, hold for 1 sec please. Alright some middle time AFI, their a gothic punk band, that can be described as purity in darkness. They are one of my favorite punk bands. Sometimes I wonder what the lives of Davey Havok and Afi are like. They seem as though they are really nice people. Having taken a picture and briefly and nervously talked to them. Yeah Bob Marley, a legend. Now thats good stuff. I mean who doesnt like Bob Marley?  His music flows through your body like the many pints of blood do. You just want to sit back and enjoy a nice beverage, for me preferably corona and a nice tequila of some sort. Not partying or whatever; it's wierd how we use party as a verb. Buffalo soldier in a war for America. Bob Marley used his fair share of pot, but he did not die from it. Who dies from cannibus?  Is it really that bad?  Should we legalize it? Nevada's police force seems more concerned with other crimes than Marijuana. Personally,  I believe marijuana is better  ",0
637,"I have not been feelling well, and my throat is bothering me. I am about to go sit in on a freshman seminar class that my cousin took last year and recommended to me. It was full though, so I signed up for another freshamn seminar calss titled ""Introducion to Italian Culture,"" but I dropped it this morning, because I think it is so irrelevant to anything I am interested in, and I am already feeling overwhelmed by my other classes alone. I was signed up to take 15 hours, but since I droppped that seminar, I now have only 12 hours. Anyway, I am going to try and add this other freshman seminar which is ""Interior Design. ""  I'm sure that the professor won't let me in, since it is already full, but I just thought that is worth a shot. I am sitting in my dorm, Hardin House, right now, and I just figured out how to use their computers here. I did not bring my own computer, so I am having to use the computers here. I still do not know how to check my email yet, though. I just figured out how to be able and send email from here. My roommate does have a computer, but I can tell that she would prefer it if I didn't use her's, so I respect that. She has been a pretty good roommate, though, all in all. We knew each other from high school, and we are fairly good friends. I was initially sort of worried about how it would work out, but I think taht it will work out fine. One of my best friends is here, also, but we decided not to room together, because we thought that it might hurt our friendship. She is the one who I am going with to the freshman seminar calss to sit in. She got into that class. Anyway, in the dorm that I am living in, there are two parts across the street from each other. Stacy, the one who is my best friend, lives across the street. The part that I live in is bigger, but I kind of wish that I lived in the other part. The people that I live with seem to be a little bit snobbier or more reserved or something. Oh well, I'm over across the street a lot, so I guess it doesn't really matter all taht much. I am so excited that R. U. F. is starting tonight. It is a bible study that I am going to go to. I've heard that it is so good, and you meet so many neat peoiple there. I miss all of the Christian based things that I went to bakc at home. I used to go to Campus Life, which was really laid back and fun, which was offered through my high school. I also wen tto a smaller bible study once a week which was led by a lady who is now one of my good friends. She is not much older than I am, so she can relate really well to all the stuff that I go through. Not taht I have any major problems or anything, but just all of the normal stuff. Speaking of problems, I did get really homesick the other day. Obviously, I guess you can tell that I am a freshman. Anyway, I got sick , adn any time I am sick I always want my mom there to go get me medicine, and take my temperature, and make me soup, and stuff like that. But, I managed just fine. I went to the health center and saw the doctor, and got a prescription and I am feeling much better today. I still am really tired though. I think that might have been why I got sick in the first place, was lack of sleep. Well, I have finished the twenty minutes, but I'm sure taht this is horribly written, but I guess it doesn;'t matter. ",1
1083,"This is the first writing assignment I have had in college. I'm a little nervous. I don't know why I should be worried about this because at least this writing assignment is an interesting one. I've never written in a stream of consciousness. I just lost my train of thought. I tend to do that. Actually, I constantly go off on these tangents as I hold any conversation. It's quite annoying. But hey, it's me. It's about to rain outside. I was just telling a friend about how hilarious it was that everyone noticed that it was raining when one student left early during class yesterday. And Professor Pennebaker was totally right when he said noone was paying attention anymore to what he was saying because we were all thinking, ""How the hell am I going to get home now?"". I laughed for a long time after that, but I was still thinking about the rain. After I ran out of class I noticed a lot of people were prepared, and had their umbrellas with them. I also noticed that the people with these umbrellas who were walking with someone else without an umbrella, did not share their umbrella with the other person. Not one of them. I thought that was extremely odd. I have never used the word umbrella so many times in one sentence. I'm very sleepy now. The rain tends to have that effect on me. I love the rain, not just for that reason but it's also soothing. But I do hate when it rains right before, or when I am about to go out. It's a hassle that I haven't had to deal with for a long time. I'm thinking we are in the middle of a drought. I can't wait until winter either. That time of year makes me happy. I don't know why I keep referring to weather. I'm not one of those, ""It's lovely weather we are having today"", kind of person. ",1
2238,"Well its after classes on this Friday. I am sll freaking' stressed out. Stupid Fahkerrdine's quiz kicked my ass. It's not that I don't know how to do it, it's just that I doubted myself. I don't know, ever since I have been here I think that I have gotten dumber, when in reality I am not. I am actually pretty damn smart. I am just letting what everyone says get to my head. So it pretty much is my fault anyway. Well from now on, I am going to walk around and take these stupid college quizzes and tests like I am smarter than the professor that made them. I probably am smarter than most of these professors, unless they are freaking geniuses, which some of them are. Damn I miss my girlfriend. She is like so freaking hot. Yeah I know she is sixteen but she doesn't look like it and I wouldn't be with her if she acted like a little girl. She is more mature than most of the girls I have for classes and some of my close girl friends. Damn I am sneezing well I am doing this in a friends room so yeah. Well Jessica is hot and I miss her. Its not really a distraction. Today I was tired I have no idea why I have been sleeping more than I ever have. I don't even read for classes. College isn't even hard. I could not read and make a C in all my classes but I want A's damnit. Stupid medical school. Wish I could fast forward my life about 8 years. But I'll be a pinche viejo by then. I wonder if because I am cussing the person that reads this will think I am an immature kid or ignorant, when in reality I probably have a more extensive vocabulary than them. And its not like I am a big cusser. Its just I have been so damn stressed lately. I was doing my chemistry homework and I ran my hands through my hair and my hair was falling out. Not like one or two try like 10 to 20 strands of hair. Um. went blank. Nah its frustrating that thoughts come and go faster than I can type them out. This keyboard's keys are all gay anyway. Well, here I am in college. Everyone once in a while it sets in. They are a lot of hot girls here. I really don't know if any of them are hotter than my girlfriend because I am in love. and yeah love makes you blind in some ways. I have been in love before. Went out with one girl for almost all of high school cept the majority of my senior year. Four damn years. My feet stink and its driving me nuts. Its like I can't wear sandals because they make my feet sweat so much. I wonder if other people have that problem. I am just going to by frebreze and shoot my damn sandals. Its probably all the bacteria on my feet. O well. Tonight I think I am going to get drunk. I have never drank before, well I have taken some sips like four. Beer tastes like shit. I am just going to drink ""chick"" drinks. I don't care what guys say. And if I do something stupid tonight o well, I need to wind down. I have been more stressed than this before, but this seems to take a lot out of me and it doesn't feel like it, until you realize it. O well. Sucks to be in college. You know my uncle is a millionaire and he is a college dropout. In fact I would say most of the worlds millionaire's are college dropouts or didn't go or went because they were already rich. I know I could do that but I don't know I guess I don't have enough confidence in myself to make it out there on my own. I don't think I like to take chances that have that great of a chance to fail. I don't like to leave things to chance. But then life has screwed me over so many times before even when I was doing all the right things so what was the point. I mean I didn't drink or do drugs I mean I tried marijuana once but c'mon that's not that bad. I love God I would go to church and like it, I would have my quiet time, I would be a pretty good Christian example till like my jr. year and what happened?  My parents got divorced, my dad made like all the money, there's five kids in my family, my dad went to jail for what he did. Gosh damn I am still embarrassed of what he did. So yeah all things this I was going to have like a nice car, my college paid for, super nice clothes I would have had it. He mad 80,000 a year and my mom made 40,000, and that's not too bad when you live in the valley. Its next to Mexico, and no we weren't drug dealers.

Doing laundry is a task that I am almost positive that I will never become accustomed to! It is boring and time consuming! When I visit home I appreciate the clean clothes in my closet even more, since they are clean and I wasn't the one to clean them! However, the independence I now have is unexplainable. I realize that I am in control of my life now and the direction I will go! Sure I had control of my life before college, but my parents were there to guide me and make sure I made the right decision. Now it's all up to me to make the right choices. I have to be the one to say, ""I don't want to go out tonight.

I know college will present me with as many challenges to overcome as well as fun memories that I will cherish forever.

I loved soundgarden but Cornells neew stuff just dosent have that bite. I probably liked them beacause Matt Cameron, Sound gardens drummer, was an early inspiration to my own drumming.

1285,"I'm somewhat in question with the purpose of this assignment. I'm in a hurry, with places to go and things to do; once again I leave things to the last moment. My 20 minutes will be up and then I will find myself fleeing out the door to make my next objective of the day. Duty from 13, and then the notsoceremonious, colors ceremony. I wonder who codes the script for these pages. Is it Dr. Pennebaker himself who makes the web pages for his own classes; I doubt that all the professors are even somewhat proficient in HTML, needless the mention all the complicated CGI scripts that must be involved with all these online forms. So long as you have a working understanding of how CGI/Java/html works, with an updated WYSIWYG web page creator, it is not all too difficult to create and publish your own web page. My topic flows from one to another as quickly as the minutes roll by while typing this assignment. The lectures of this class are interesting, even entertaining (imagine that), though I'm worried on the difficulty of the test. We have covered a great deal of material from the book, most of which was only very vaguely covered in class. Most of the concepts so far are somewhat familiar to me. I took psych my junior year in High School with a very good teacher. He used every moment that was allocated in his classes to make sure we absorbed as much knowledge as possible. He was dedicated to his work, and would compel us to be dedicated to ours. This is of course Friday, and while I was supposed to be free after noon today, I find that my ROTC obligation will keep me occupied at least until 1700. I'm beginning to realize just how much time this is taking up from me; it will be a struggle to maintain any academic performance that I have begun in my classes. I have taken either tests or exams in all but this class. The computers are down so I don't know what my grade is yet, and I don't have enough time to check with the correction sheet on the website to calculate my grade myself. Well, my twenty minutes is almost up, just a few more to go. I haven't really written much, nor has my writing kept any cohesive thought or substance to it, but I suppose that's what's to be expected from something like this. I don't know what this is supposed to convey about me or my personality, but whatever it is, I probably wouldn't want to know anyway. And now I'm off to finish the rest of my day. ",0
599,"I feel bad right now because my stomach is very upset, it's been upset for the past week or two and I'm afraid to go to the doctor, but anyway, I guess that's not really that important right now right?  I should really be thinking about school and the 15 hour load that I'm taking and hoping that I'll be able to pass all classes with and A or a B. my father did tell me that he would give me $100 for every A that I get and $50 for the B's. It just goes to show hoe desperate he is that he wants me to get good grades. but maybe UT is just too hard for mr  This is the only chance I have, you must do good Adina, you must. I should really believe in myself and hopefully finish school faster than my brother did that way my parents will be able to take a break for one year and save for Daniel's tuition. We are five years apart. I wonder if Karel will call me this weekend. It's been a whole week, maybe he doesn't care, maybe he just has someone else, someone better than me?  how could he treat me so bad all this time and me just be here waiting for him. I should stop thinking about all this and worry about other things. I really don't know how dad's going to come up with 10,000 dollars to take out those tanks from the gasoline store. We are just too poor. and how could abuelito be so selfish and not pay those 17,000 dollars that he owes in taxes on the mineral rights. Tia is really upset because she doesn't think he cares much about anything anymore. which is partially true because the oil wells weren't his anyway the were abuelita's. boy do I miss her , even though I never met my own grandmother I know that she was a very beautiful lady. my dad must have been said when they told him that welita died. he would have stayed in the air force longer but I guess things just happen right, what I mean is it, it's 2:17  I still have about 10 more minutes to write. my mind is blank , I don't know what to say, this weekend when I went home there were so many flood charity things for the people of my hometown, Eagle Pass, and for the people of Del Rio. My mom and I should give all he close that we don' t wear anymore to those people. I can't believe how high the Rio rose. As we crossed the bridge on Friday I noticed that the river was completely back to normal but when I saw the pictures that my dad took of the river when it was high near welito's house it looked bad. I can't' believe all that stuff was under water. How could God do this to all these people. the worst thing about it is that it landed on the poorest of them all. the poorest are the ones that have to suffer the most. I hope that one day I can be rich and that I may be  able to donate a lot of my money to the poorest people of our countries. People shouldn't have to suffer in such terrible ways,      well, I sure do miss mom, right now she's in San Antonio because she took pappy to the doctor. I think my dad might have diabetes and he doesn't know it. my grandfather has diabetes too and you know how dad is,  all his life he's always liked sweets. he has a sweet tooth, exactly like his daughter. I love sweets a lot. I really do, I always think that one day I might be the one that has diabetes and not my dad. I hope not though. but maybe if I did then I would be able to lose weight. oh well, anyway. I guess I better close this because I'm just about running out of time, although I wish I could keep writing because I kind of like just typing into keys and pressing down on them with thoughts that I have in my head. well, hope you like my confusing thoughts, or who knows, maybe you won't even read this. got to go. . :0) ",0
1421,"My mind is wandering back and forth between what I want to do and what I need to do. I need to study, read about a dozen chapters out of my textbooks and learn the material inside and out, but I don't want to. I want to just remain calm and lie down on my bed with no worries and no setting of the alarm clock. That's all. Is that too much to ask? I'm actually in a rather uncomfortable state of mind right now, or in reality, I've been in that state of mind since the first day of school. It seems I have lost a lot of my drive and motivation, but I'm trying to gain it back. I want it BACK! Anyway, I am somewhat depressed and sad and I just feel uneasy. I want to be able to give my emotions freely, love in particular, but something always holds me back. Maybe I'm scared, I don't know. What am I going to do with my life? Now that's a question which really needs an answer, but do I have oneno, not me! I am currently a biology major, but I don't know if that is what I want to do. I don't want to go to medical school, but I don't know what else would be really interesting for me. I am very scared that I'm not going to find out what I want to be or should be and then I'm just going to be stuck. Competition is awful, especially between siblings. My brother knows what he wants to do, and I am 100% certain that he will be successful, in fact I know that he would be great at anything he decided to do. That's what I wantI want to know that I'm going to make it without a doubt or hesitation. This is the lack of motivation, inspiration, confidence, or whatever, I was referring to earlier. I use to be very strongwilled and I always set my mind to something and did it. Now, I know I still do that to a certain degree, but not as much, I WANT IT BACKNOW! I'm lonely and tired. I want to find some really good people who I can become really good friends with, but for some reason, I'm really not looking that hard. My social skills have also decided to go into hibernation for a while. Consequently, its my first year at The University of Texas, surrounded by 50,000 people, and I don't even go out of my way to meet new people. That is something that is really starting to bother me, but hopefully as I get more familiar and comfortable with the system and environment everything will end up working out by itself. See normally, my thought would be that I would change and rise to the challenge because that's me, but not now, now I am depending on a nonexistent entity to ""work out by itself. "" Oh well, something needs to change. ",0
873,"I really wish people would be more efficient with their laundry. It annoys me to no extent when people don't keep up with it. Just a few minutes ago I was trying to wash my towels and I couldn't because the person left their clean, washed clothes in the washer. I felt bad taking the stuff out and leaving it around. It's not like I would of thrown it on the floor or anything, but I feel wierd picking someone else's clothes and underwear out of the machine. Well I built up the courage because I was annoyed and I then realized that the machine next to it, which was in use before, was now free. So I had a whole who-ha over nothing. Oh well. I actually love doing laundry for some strange reason. I love clean clothes that smell really good. I use dryer sheets and fabric softner so they smell extra yummy. I keep looking at the clock because I'm waiting for Road Rules to come on. They kicked this girl Ruthie off last time because she has an alcohol problem. I really don't think it solved the problem at all. Now she'll be even more inclined to do whatever she feels like. I guess I've never lived with or experienced alcoholism so I wouldn't know what it is like. Needless to say, Ruthie is extremely reluctant to go to rehab. She firmly believes that she is a strong enough person to do this on her own. Don't they all say that? Well I hope she gets better because I know it must be an extremely hard thing to overcome, especially by yourself. I think professional help is an extremely good thing and nothing to be ashamed of. I know many people who have had rough times and psychiatrists and psychologists are very helpful in overcoming depression, alcoholism, or whatever it may be. I know that a lot of celebrities go to shrinks. Rosie O'Donnell talks about it openly- about herself and with her guests too. She thinks it's a great thing. I think it's good that occasionally you can have someone who listens to you regardless and someone that you know will not judge you in any type of way. Although I am a firm believer of not having other people tell you what to think, I think this is totally different. These kind of people are trained and don't tell you how your mind works. I think they simply stimulate ideas, thoughts and reactions that allow one to think about things in different lights and more fully. Ok-enough about that. I've noticed that my roommate takes really long showers. I take mine in the morning and I'm in there for seriously about 2 or 3 minutes. Whereas she's in there for like 10 or so. I wonder why that is. I guess I'm in such a rush in the morning that I'm not going to stand there idely and have a think about my day. There doesn't seem to be enough time to do that now but I guess essentially I'm doing that now. Maybe it's not all it's cracked up to be. I'd rather focus on what's ahead tomorrow rather than the stressful day I had today, primarily in the computer lab. I've decided that I really don't like programming and the technical stuff of computers. I really don't care how it works as long as it does for me. I'll just have to put up with that class until Christmas to get my credit. I'd feel kind of sad if I was a professor and people only took my class because their academic advisor advised them too or if they just did it to fill their credits. I guess they're used to it and don't take it personally. Whatever. Ok- time's up now. I've been writing for 20 minutes as told. Bye. ",0
1832,"I am sitting in my dorm room listening to my roomate talk on the phone to her boyfriend. I have just finished studying and everything i have just read is all jumbled in my head. I am thinking about the weekend and what I am going to do because my roomate's sister is coming to stay with us. She is a junior and has just come out and said that she is depressed. I want to take her out and make sure she has a good time. However, I went to my chapter meeting tonight and they told us that this weekend we were having out pledge retreat and a field day on Saturday. I have so much to study for and so much reading and I have to entertain a 16 year old girl. I don't know how I am going to get everything done. But I know that everything will work our because it always does. I am listening to little pieces of information about my roomates conversation and am very curious as to what is going on. It sounds very interesting. I am just thinking about everything that I need to do and all of the people I need to talk to. It is so difficult when you have to talk to all of your friends from your hometown and talk to your mother while trying to go to class, meetings, and everything else. It seems there are never enough hours in the day. My roomate is offering our room to a couple of her friends to come stay at our dorm this weekend. The girls are extremely annoying and I think I will have to find somewhere to stay. Hopefully our retreat is overnight. It has been alright with my roomate and I. He were best friends in Elementary school but things do change. I came in the other night and she was drunk and was trying on my clothes. It pissed me off but I can't say anything just because she is too nice. She left this weekend and went to San Antonio and stayed with her boyfriend. They got a hotel room for the night. It was nice having the room all to myself. I have my entire schedule with a boy who I went to high school with. I was shocked at first but now it is very helpful. We can tell each other and remind each other about assignments and other things. I went to my FIG class today and felt like I was back in the fifth grade. He assigned us a project where we have to create a shield. The usual what you like, a word that describes you, and other stuff to that nature. I finally talked to my ex-boyfriend today for the first time in a couple of weeks. We broke up because we were going to different colleges and he couldn't handle it. He is too much of a guy. Everyone went home this weekend in my dorm and I was all alone. Our room smells like chinese food because we can't take our trash out until Thursday so until then it stinks. I still have not done an laundry yet because out dorn is out of special laundry cards. I need to go to the grocery store to buy more folders and drinks. I will probably leave and go with a girl who lives down my hall. I am excited that I don't have class tomorrow until 2:00. We have a Theta mexican lunch tomorrow that I am taking my best friend to. Everyone in my pledge class is so caught up with Jenna Bush. I almost think people joined it because she is in it. She is just like every other girl in that room with the exception that her father is the President of the United States. At our meeting tonight the Secret Service was there. That part if kind of cool to see them. It gives you a sense of security that you are protected as well. All of the girl in my pledge class are really nice. I met the sweetest girl down my hall. I am going to her Grandmother's 75th birthday party in a couple of weeks somewhere near Dallas with her. My computer keeps messing us and the pointer is going to the middle of the page. My suitemate just made popcorn and is offering it to us. It smells incredible. ",0
1023,"well, write now I guess there are a lot of things going through my head, but it's hard for me to put them into words I guess. well I had fun last nite. i went to a party witha bunvh of friends. a lot of people were drinking, but iwas one of the few that wasn't drinking. it seemed like everyonw who was drinking had fun, but I had fun, even though I didnt drink. i had fun just dancing an d meeting people. i met a lot of guys, which wus good. since I usually am kinda shy bout meeting peopple. anywyas. i'm really tired right now, because we only went to sleep around 6, even though we came home around 430, and I had to get up at 11 because a friend from out of town styed over, so I had to help them pack and get ready to leave and stuff. gosh, I lkie so many guys right now, but I think that my other friends like the sme guys that I like, or at least they think he's cute too, but I don't know what to do aobut it. oh well, I guess I'll jus have to figure somthing out. man, I have a lot of homework to do today. actually I need ot catch up on my reading. i have a lot of reading to do in this class, then I have chem homework and calculus homework. i'm so lost in my chem class. well, not lost, but I wish I knew someone else in that class, so I could at leasst have someone to do homework with or jus to call if I had any questions, buti  guess I should just start meeting people in there, or someting, because I really need to find a study buddy in there. I think that's my only class that I don't know anyone in. i have friends in my language class, and in my calculus class and in my psych class. i just don't kno anyone in my chem class. but hopefully that will change soon. oh today either my roomate's dad or my dad called today, but this guy that was in our room picked up the phone, and our partents are really strict about guys, so I hope I don't get in trouble. the guy who picked up the phone covered it up pretty well, but then we expected our parntets to call again, but no one ever called, so I kinda got worried, that they would think that we have guys in our room. oh well, I think I may be getting worried over nothinh. because they probably wont even say anyting, or even know. oh well. oh, I have a minute left in my writing assigment, so I guess that's it ",1
1302,"Well, since I don't know how to start, I'll start by talking about my weekend. I just about killed myself learning how to slalom ski. We started Saturday. Buck, Carl, Dylan, Kevin, Crystal, and I went to Lake Georgetown with my new boat. I made it my goal to learn how to slalom ski. I actually got up on one ski relatively quickly. The only problem is that it hurts when you fall. I broke my nose the first time that I fell because I kneed myself in the face. I spent the rest of the afternoon learning how to keep my balance and how to jump. The only problem with Saturday is that Crystal and Carl got into a fight. They've been dating for a couple of weeks now. Anyway, we went back to the lake Sunday and I kept trying different things and now I'm pretty good on one ski. And it is a blast, I'll never go back to two skis. Sunday night I played the role of mediator for everyone. I talked to Crystal about Carl and I talked to Carl about Crystal. They are trying to work things out, but it is going to be tough. Then I talked to Danielle about Buck. Danielle is one of Crystal's friends that started hanging out with us. She liked Buck a lot. Buck wasn't sure how he felt about her at first, but he's starting to like her. Right now they have bumped their relationship status to dating. This is good because they make a good couple and they make each other happy. At least as far as I can tell. But I did a lot of talking and more importantly listening Sunday. I think I helped smooth everything over with them for now. Carl and Crystal seem to be getting along better. I missed classes Monday because of injuries that I received over the weekend. I broke my nose, twisted my back and my left knee, and got a terrible case of whiplash. I couldn't even get out of bed Monday morning. I'm starting to recover though. I had to go to work Tuesday. I work at Internet Gateway in Georgetown. I love working there except that I don't get paid near what I should be getting. I make $9/hr. That should be 23 times more, but I only work 2 days a week anyway. I was working full time but I decided that since I have to go to school, I should make it my top priority. I didn't want to go to college, I'm not sure that I want to now that I'm going; but I know it is for the best and it makes my mom happy. That's really the only reason I'm going is because my mom wanted me to. Actually my whole family was pushing me to go. This is OK though because I know that they only want the best for me and a college education will help out tremendously later in life. Especially when I start looking for a better paying job. Although, college has been really fun so far. I have had my own house since this summer. Buck and I are roommates and we are renting a house in Georgetown. It is a lot of work, but it is worth it to say that I have my own place. Buck and I met at work. His dad owns the company where I am employed and he started working there during the spring. We have gotten to be best friends and we hang out all of the time. He is a good guy. We have a lot in common too. I've been lucky in that regard. I have a lot of good friends, and several that I can depend on for anything. It is a really good feeling to know that I can trust someone like Buck with my life. I've also been very lucky because my family is very close and we all can depend on each other. My stepfather bought me a truck for graduation last year. Robert, my stepfather, is a great guy and my mom and him make a very good couple. Well, I've put over my 20 minutes into this paper, and I have to go back to work now. ",1
1070,"As I sit here at my desk typing, all I can think about is how hot I am and how come our room is so unbelievably hot. I am under a lot of stress right now because I have so many pages to read and it takes me so long to read them since I have trouble focusing on them. By body is starting to sweat, maybe I should tell my RA to turn down the AC. I am really stressing over having to read biology, because, no matter how much I read it, I just can't comprehend what the book is saying. I'm sure I will struggle in biology this year. At first, I couldn't understand why you are making us do this, but now that I am doing this I understand the purpose behind it. This is really helping me to gather my thoughts and it is actually nice to express your feelings. My stomach feels extremely full because I just came from the Dobie cafeteria. I really wish I hadn't eaten so much junk food, I need to eat healthier. I am really regretting eating that ice cream, I have got to stop doing that. I also need to work out more. It all of a sudden just occurred to me that the reason I am so hot is because I am sunburned. When you're sunburned does your body just start letting of hot air or something? It is obviously clear that I am unfamiliar with the way my body works. I am dreading class tomorrow because I am so behind on my reading. I probably should be doing reading instead of doing this. Its funny how you find yourself doing anything just for the sake of avoiding the things you don't want to do. I only have to write for a few more minutes. I wonder what my test is going to be like in biology. If I take great notes and read, even if I don't comprehend it very well, will I still be able to do well on the tests? My elbow has just started throbbing because I scraped it water skiing earlier today. I really wish I wouldn't have fallen because it starts throbbing every time I extend my elbow. Oh great! Time's up. Talk to you later. katie ",0
192,"Well I'm not sure what to start talking about. It's taken forever just to get this assignment started. I had to set up an if account and all that before I could  start. I hate coming to new computer labs, this one is new to me because I just transferred here. I feel totally computer illiterate, so I start to feel like an idiot when the lab people have to go around with me and me  figure it all out. But anyway, I'm here now doing it, and I guess you always learn something from these situations. I learned that I need to get my own account set up from my computer in my room, so then I don't have to worry about coming up here and dealing with this. I guess we are just supposed to tell you what we're thinking about and our thoughts as they change. Well all I keep thinking is I wonder what you are going to think about my thoughts and ramblings when you read this. Maybe you'll enjoy it because I sound paranoid and you can analyze me! ha ha I'm looking out the window now at the trees, wishing I was out there and not working on this assignment. I still have fifteen more minutes to write. I wonder what everyone else here is working on. I'd rather be here doing this than doing the physics equations I was working on before I got here. Psychology is so much more interesting than the other sciences. Well now I have an E-mail account. I never had one before. I think it will be fun to be able to send and get mail. Especially because my boyfriend still lives in Dallas and its getting expensive calling each other every day, but it wouldn't be the same not to here his voice. I've never really been in the UGL before, I registered here but I haven't ever been in here to do any work. I probably should have been in here before now though! I think the chairs are to too low or maybe the desks are too high, its just not that comfortable. I guess they want you to sit up and have good posture like they taught you in typing class. There, I lost my cursor for a while. I guess thatÃ¯Â¿Â½s why it says - Who knows I. Well I have to help cook dinner at my co-op tonight, we are having Mediterranean Turkey. I wonder what thatÃ¯Â¿Â½s going to taste like, good I hope. Well my time is just about up  so I guess its time to submit my paper. I hope you never read these but even if you do I guess I won't really matter because with the size of our class you don't know me from Adam!  ",1
174,"and now its time to write about this wonderful stream of consciousness stuff  that we learned about in our high school English class and about all the greats  like william faulkner. you know, its kind of annoying that I should have to  hit enter at the end of each line as though this were a typewriter, you might  look into the text instructions for this window in the original scripting to see if it can be made to auto-return like some of the others do, but this is still a  rather well laid out page and method of submitting a psych project. kudos to  you. I wish my other teachers would do this. so what am I thinking about. well there's the Washington/Pittsburgh football game on TV right now. I have  no idea whose winning or anything like that because IÃ¯Â¿Â½m not really paying THAT much  attention to it or anything but Washington did make a great touchdown a while ago (aha! WashingtonÃ¯Â¿Â½s in the lead thirteen to seven) marvelously exciting I know. lets see. what else. well now here's a good one. I have to write this bioethics paper about an case  study (why donÃ¯Â¿Â½t the delete options work properly in this window) on this couple who undergo an ""amniocentesis"" test on their newly discovered child (donÃ¯Â¿Â½t worry its still in her womb) and they find out that the child has a genetic disorder  called turner syndrome. what I have to do is write about this case and give my  Prof. an opinion one way or the other as to whether the couple should abort  the fetus or keep it. which means in turn that I have to come to some sort of  conclusion as to my beliefs on abortion. what a task. what a mind-consuming task but then maybe I shouldnÃ¯Â¿Â½t tell you that IÃ¯Â¿Â½m thinking of something other than my  psych writing, but then again, I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t imagine you would expect us (IÃ¯Â¿Â½m not  referring to myself as us, but rather the class (hate for you to think IÃ¯Â¿Â½m schizo  or something)) to focus directly on the task at hand since as best as I can tell the task at hand is not focusing on the task at hand quite specifically so and another thing, whenever fox sports shows a little window w/ player stats they play this obnoxious little theme music blurb on piano and I've heard it at l a million times and its starting to grate on my brain or something. so back to biomedical ethics: everything that I have been taught tells me that abortion is wrong for all the  reasons and everything, but is it fair to bring a life into the world w/ such a  condition. but then again, there are many things much worse than turners  syndrome. like what if she was born a democrat. that would suck. and now my friend from back home has just sent me a message on icq. sheÃ¯Â¿Â½s a nice person. not incredibly attractive but very loving and compassionate. but none the less, a wonderful friend. sheÃ¯Â¿Â½s still at home right now b/c sheÃ¯Â¿Â½s going to UCLA and school doesnÃ¯Â¿Â½t start until like the end of September or something. she got  a job but I think sheÃ¯Â¿Â½s still bored as hell just sitting around talking with  the little kids who are still in high school and she gets to hear them complain  about the orchestra director and all that nonsense. I just explained to her  what IÃ¯Â¿Â½m doing. the internet is a wonderful thing I think. I can talk to a  friend for free in almost real-time over icq (another great thing in the internet) any time that I want to. and now there's one of those funny Joe Namath commercials on TV. theyÃ¯Â¿Â½re just a hoot. well, my twenty minutes are just almost up, so I think that ill be off now. its been real fun chatting with you. have a nice day and all that.

1266,"So, I am supposed to write about what thoughts are going through my head now, all right. I am wondering about this class, I have only heard good things about it except for the fact that it is hard to get an 'A' in it. I really hope that I can because I am trying to make a 4. 0 this semester, to start off college on the right foot. I feel like a dork because at my dorm everyone goes out every night and I stay home and read well last night I just goofed off most of the night because I couldn't concentrate. Since I don't know what to expect on our first college tests I am going to make sure that keep up to date with my school work. I had a lot of fun at the Delt Pledge party this weekend though, I was a time that I went out and it was worth it. I just saw that my clock on my bedside table is 5 minutes faster than my computer; I will need to fix that in a minute because I know the computer is right. It felt better outside this morning there was a breeze and it wasn't too hot. The football game is going to be horribly hot but I can't wait! I really need to get back into typing. I mean that I have been making a lot of typos I hope that I am catching them. I am listening to Simon and Garfunkle I love them, one of my best friends, Hilary and I used to always sing to ""Cecilia"". Hilary goes to Tech; I haven't talked to her in a while. I need to make some phone calls to my high school friends but I am sort of overwhelmed right now with school. It will be better tomorrow because I only have 2 classes tomorrow and 1 on Friday. Monday I have 4 classes, that is going to be killer! It's been nice since we haven't had a Monday class yet, though. I went to aerobics today and didn't get a very hard work out so I tried to go to Gregory but I forgot that it isn't opened until after 12:05 on weekdays because they have class in the weight room. I went to the CoOp to return 2 books but the worker told me that I needed to bring another receipt so I'll have to back tomorrow. I have been trying to stay on campus on days that I have classes with breaks that are 1Ã¯Â¿Â½ hours or less between classes. That makes me read and eat lunch outside and so I don't waste time walking home and back to class. It is a good plan but by the end of the day I am very tired. I like this writing assignment. It make me aware of what I think about randomly I guess that is the point of the project. I want to see the movie ""Bring it On"" it's a cheerleader movie. I heard it was corny but that I would like it I cheered in high school and so I guess it's a given that I would enjoy anything of this sort. I can't wait to watch the cheerleaders, dancers, and band at the football game I love football too. It's weird to me that the transition from high school to college hasn't been a bigger deal to me. It sort of feels like I am at camp. I like it here. Oh, it's been 22 minutes! Bye ",1
979,"I feel really crappy, today, I didn't get enough sleep last night. I think part of it is the Texas loss on Saturday, especially the way they loss. Least the Cowboys won last night. So far I haven't been very home sick. It might be because my roommate went to the same high school as I did. I have also been able to talk to my parents a lot because of instant chat. My mom wnts to get a web cam so she can actually see me. I think she has a hard time with me leaving, I'm the first child to leave home. The network here at UT is really cool. The connect rates are really fast. I had a crummy 28. 8 modem at home. My dad was going to get DSL, but we lived to far from the central office, that sucks. I'm really hungry now. I'm not hungry in the morning, but halfway through class, my stomach starts to hurt. It's probably because I'm used to sleeping late and not eating breakfast at all. 10 min to go. I'm not taking an English this year. That's good. I don't like to write papers very much. You might write a paper you feel is perfectly valid, but turns out to be wrong. Yet you put so much work into it. 6 min. Milk tastes pretty good. I'm used to 2% at home, but here, my roomate and I just buy the full vitamin D milk, yum. I hope there isn't a writing length, I'm having sensation block. 3 min. Time is almost up. Might take a nap, my next class isn't for another 5 hours. I don't have classes on Fridays which is so cool. 1 min. My alarm is about to go off. Set it for 20 min, so I wouldn't write too much. Time's up.    ",0
2254,"I finally got to see Matrix: Revolutions. I don't know what everyone was talking about, saying it was awful.

I've been thinking about why this is the case for a long while now. I think it might have to do with our expectations. I loved the first one. I was waiting for the second one to come out ever since I heard they were making a trilogy. I had good expectations for Reloaded, and I went to the theatre to see it on opening night and I was disappointed. The interesting thing is that about a month earlier, X-Men 2 came out. I liked the first one a lot, but I wasn't waiting with bated breath for the 2nd one to come out (like how it was with Reloaded). My expectations were, shall we say, nonexistent. I hadn't given it a lot of thought about what to expect. When I went to that movie theatre to see it, it blew me away. After about an hour and a half had gone by, I checked my friend's watch because I was worried the movie would end soon.         Enough Matrix talk. I just got back from Vegas, and I got to see David Copperfield. Hmmm. It might be interesting to look at what he does from a psychological researcher's standpoint, being an ""illusionist"" and all. I saw through one of his tricks, though it might have been due to the fact that I'm very proficient in visual media. I think it might be because I've seen all of those Goddamned behind the scenes ""documentary"" stuff for the extended versions of Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers. In a way it's kind of spoiled the tricks that movie makers use. Maybe it would have been better to remain ignorant and enjoy movies strictly on the visual surface. I had a point to this. Copperfield. Yeah, it was fun. I found it interesting that his show used a lot of technological ""illusions. ""  What I mean by that is that he used a lot of video footage or complex audio and video queues in the show. Again, it might've been better if I had remained ignorant of how simple it was to do some of his tricks. The older audience members must have been stumped.          Kenji's very cute. He's finally decided to settle down for the, oh, I don't know. Next hour at the most.  Whenever I'm on the computer, he tends to sleep on my CD book so that he can still be close to me, but he's chosen a different spot. Instead of being directly to the right of me, he's directly to the left of me. Big difference!  Before I'd moved the computer onto where it is now, I had it closer to the bed on Ryan's desk. Ken would spend most of his time while I was on the computer on the corner of my bed. Er, sorry. AMANDA'S bed. I still can't get over the time when I talked to her (a very rare time since the Kerry people have been working her little ass of ever since she moved out and I took her old apartment) and I was so excited that I'd bought this silky linen for, and I quote, ""my bed. ""  ""You mean MY bed,"" she said. ""I bought it. You're only keeping the things in that apartment while I'm gone working on the campaign. ""  Bullshit. When we were kids, do you think we would go around saying to are friends, ""Oh, I have to go now. I need to go to my mom's bed. or what I should call my mom's bed, because she bought it even though I sleep in it every night. ""  Yeesh!  She's just being possessive because she really likes to identify herself as being financially independent. I hope she'll get over it, because I really resent the fact that she believes I'm supposed to look around all the furniture in this apartment as hers. For some reason that really bugs me. Ken's awake and about now. It's making it difficult to type now, because he's trying to claw the keyboard while I'm typing. My times up anyway, so tah! ",0
1846,"So I'm in the room with 2 guys and another girl and they're having this conversation that's really distracting me. Not to worry, I'll soon be engulfed in my own stream of consciousness and I'm sure this will turn out really funny. Actually, right now I'm laughing because they were making fun of my job. Haha. Alright, back to business. This is one of my favorite things to do. My friend just distracted me by trying to read this. Anyway, work was long and boring today. Lots of restlessnes and paranoia. Haha, the people in the room are being really funny. This guy is telling a really descriptive story (which is how I tell stories) and the other guy is all like,   get to the point!    I'm avoiding trying to read what I just wrote so that I can move on to the next paragraph. Everyone thinks its funny that I'm taking this so seriously. Its really hard to concentrate!!  Lalalala, why do people fall for people who are already in relationships?  And why do I think I actually have a chance?  I think I have a really big chance. But I don't have long term goals. Hmm. I enjoy anticipation and a challenge, and that's what the person I have a crush on is to me. Its really exciting. It got quiet all of a sudden. Funny how that happens. I like it. I like the awkwardness. Uh oh, they're talking about sex now!  Got to love college kids. Ahhh!  So, my throat is dry, I'm about to grab a beer. And I'm one of those who actually like beer for the taste of it. Just call me a beer enthusiast. I'm not even sure if I spelled that correctly. You know, I won the spelling bee in 5th grade. And in 4th grade, I lost because I got the word   condemn   and I spelled it c-o-n-d-o-m. And I didn't understand why the judges were laughing until 2 years later. Anyway, I have 8 and a half minutes left and the person I have a crush on hasn't called yet. She's supposed to come over and play Battleship with me and my friends. I really wish she could break free from her controlling boyfriend. But I'm not one to judge her relationship since I was the controlling figure in my last relationship. ::sigh::  Lets not talk about my last relationship, I'll go to that bad place in my head. No regrets, no regrets. Alright, so I am really tempted to call her now. Umm, how is this computer going to organize my thoughts?  Haha, I work for a computer company. Actually, the biggest computer company in probably the world right now. But that's not really important. Not saying that my thoughts aren't important because I believe everything I say or think has some huge significance. Even if I can't understand them. I don't even know if that made sense. Its hot in here. I hate laptops. Tony just told his roomate to grab me a beer. I should tell them to call Lisa to get her to come over here. Sometimes people need a little push out the door, know what I mean?  I wonder if these pants look too big on me, they're really comfortable. My nostrils are flaring. People think its cute. I am done. Ok, maybe not. I have to keep going for like 3 minutes. My friends are making small talk. Small talk is funny. Ahh yes, a beer. Except I don't like drinking out of cans. Why is that?  I love bottles. And Dos Equis. I take after my father. But then again, I love white zinfandel, which is my mother's favorite wine. Woah, its almost 9:30 and she still hasn't called yet. I'm getting upset. Maybe a little obsessed. I make myself laugh. Now I'm listening to them talk about me. I like the attention. Count down. ",0
1854," The past week I have honestly felt the most incredible feeling of being overwhelmed. I am so frustrated and annoyed by everyone around me and everything that they do. I so badly want to step forward and correct everything that these people are doing wrong but for some reason I keep holding myself back. This frustration only makes my head hurt and keeps me angry at the world. My presence then becomes quite rude and unfriendly. I'm not quite sure what to do about this little problem. I really don't think that it's me. My suitemate is about to push me over the edge. She never picks up after herself, never helps clean the dorm room, never buys and groceries (even though she finds its all right to consume mass quantities of the food that me and my two other roomates buy), and she basically is worthless around the room. For example, the other day she mentioned that we needed paper towels and bottled water. On most circumstances that wouldnt bother me, however, she makes these claims but at the same time takes no initiative to fix them. She just assumes that me or my roomates will take care of the missing items in the room. She is from Beverly Hills. Im under that impression that she had someone to pick up after her and do everything for her when she lived there. Typical if you ask me. I just can't handle her behavior or her attitude anymore. On top of that, I am homesick. I miss my friends. I miss being with Richie. He'll call me once and a while. Usually he'll call me non stop for a straight week, and then I won't hear from him for quite a while. I get so anxious to hear from him, but he acts like he could care less if he talked to me. That makes me so mad. My roomate aka my best friend since middle school chastises me everytime i talk to him. It just makes me so upset that she thinks that he doesnt care about me in the least. Sure, he may not show the normal feelings that most people show towards the ones that they care about, but I know that he cares about me. If he didnt care, he wouldnt bother calling me. Its honestly one of the worst feelings knowing that your best friend in the world is sitting there making fun of you and getting annoyed by the fact that you are in a complete state of happiness when you talk to the one person you care about. It really makes me wonder why she is the one person I confide in the most. Speaking of her, she is in this relationship with a boy whom I adore as a friend. He is so much fun to be around, but he is here all the time. I turn around and he is always there. I never get to sleep in my own room, I am constantly forgotten about or simply not included in activities that she would normally include me in, and to top it all off, the relationship is not even healthy. I find it ironic that she gets mad at me when I talk to Richie, and feels that she can make whatever assumptions or claims about my relationship with him, but when I make the smallest remark about her and her boyfriend, she flips out. It doesn't seem all that fair to me. But then again, what is fair?  Is it fair that I want to be with someone that I can't have anymore? No its not fair, but thats the way that it will be. Sometimes I wonder if I will ever get a break; If maybe one day I'll get lucky and things will turn out the way I wanted them to, or if maybe Richie will wake up one day and decide that he wants to be with me and not with the girl he is with right now. Sometimes I wonder if my relationship with my mom will ever improve. She and I couldn't possibly be more different than we are. I can't even believe that I am her child sometimes. She acts so much like a child. If she doesn't get her way she mopes and she has to put me down to make herself feel better. She denies having made my sister depressed throughout her late childhood and early adultood. I think that its the subtle remarks about my figure, my study habits, my relationships that make me so mad at her. I want to tell her how I feel but she will retaliate and take something away from me that I need. She always used to do that in high school. If I told her what was on my mind, she would take away my car, or my privileges to stay out late. I can never win. Its either   give up my priviliges   or keep my mouth shut. It is a lose lose situation. I just miss Richie so much. That could be the root of all my unhappiness. My mom, and suitemate could all just be elements of my sadness due to my distance away from him. He called me today. Ironically I was lying in bed thinking about him, when the phone rang. It felt so good to see his name on my cell phone when i looked at it.   ",1
128,"To think about what life has become can be kind of scary. I wish I had a penny for every time I was about to mess up and I think I would be a very rich woman. If I only knew at 15 what I now know at almost 21, I could have saved myself alot of pain and confusion. Then couldn't we all have?  I get scared sometimes when I think about today, two weeks from now and even years from now. The future is a very scary thing especially when you don't know what it could bring. I wish I hadn't made some of the choices I've made but those are over and done with aren't they. The only thing I need to learn how to do now is to learn from my mistakes. I feel really bad sometimes because I try to force my ideas and ideologies on those younger than me but I feel older and wiser than my years. I feel alot older than 20 sometimes yet I think, "" hey I'm only 20, I have so much life to live""  Yet I'm scared to live that life. I wish I could just go with the flow instead of worry about every choice I make all the time. Even when I go with the flow I don't know what I'm doing and then I worry about what could happen after the fact. Another thing that really bothers me is the whole concept of love. What is it and how do I know if I've found it or not. When I was 15 I knew alot more about love than I do now. Why do I ramble on so, it is the same dilemma and the same problems I face every single day. I really should just give up and go with the flow. not worry about things so much. Life's too short to worry right,. All I'm doing is stressing myself out over nothing. Stress is not something I should have in my life. My whole world is sheltered and taken care of and paid for. What do I really have to worry about. Not that my dad doesn't have stipulations on what I do but it is all basically taken care of with no questions asked. Life shouldn't be that easy right?  Maybe that's why I continue to torture myself with these unnecessary dilemmas. I'm one of those drama people to I need drama in my life, something always going on or I get bored. I need conflict but not too much because then I get way too stressed out. I just don't know what to do with daddy's little girl who seems really messed up in the head,  There I go again creating drama, I'm not really messed up but sometimes I try to convince my self that I am to try to get counseling or something. I think it's a hidden Freudian issue. I should have had counseling when I was a child but I never got it because I didn't really need it. Maybe I was really traumatized as a child and now it's coming out subliminally. Ok enough kelly, this is not like you. I really don't think all of this I just do sometimes. Who knows  I sure as hell don't. My dog is so cute now. too bad I don't live with him. I want to be taken care of pampered in a way, just plain babied. That's what should happen for women isn't it. No we should be strong and independent but I don't really feel that way. I would love to live a life similar to my mom's. She isn't as taken care of as I would like to be but my daddy does all right by her. Who knows what life will bring maybe I will quit thinking about it. oh. the clock on my computer says I've been typing for twenty minutes. Cool this is a really good stress reliever and I really felt like I was talking to someone. Cya ",0
340,"I am in the computer, I wish IÃ¯Â¿Â½m I bed right now, God I'm tired. Are my doing this right I sure hope so. Do I need to hit return after each line. Man this is harder than I thought. only 5 mins past. I wanna go  eat lunch now. Boy I type fast. That girl is really good looking, I wonder what her name is.

I need to go back to Houston and bring my basketball here. I missed my room. Need help?  The lab assistant is there to answer any of your questions, yeah right, that  girl here yesterday was no help at all. I wish I have a computer in my dorm. I wonder if my roommate is still asleep. I should be sleeping to. I think I did this in high school, but IÃ¯Â¿Â½m not sure if it's the same thing. I really need this ten points, so I better get a good grade on this. I missed Ling, I wish she's here with me  right now. I wanna an ice cream. Boy this is Boring, I really do think about a lot of things. Turn the music  down damn it. Hey I like this computer.

Do I really think about all these different thing before, nah. okay the lab is closing, I think I should go to lunch now bye. Yes, one down two to go. ",0
1629,"My fiance is making me do my writing assignment now. He just pushed me in front of the computer. This is my third time to try and do this thing. I'm really hoping that it works this time. It gets kind of frustrating. Jesse wants to read what I'm typing. He's making me nervous because I don't want him to read this, but I'm sure he'll figure some way to see it. He says that I don't trusthim because i don't want him to read it. I don't like loud noises, especially from things like vacuums. Jesse is vacuuming right now. I don't like it when people play music loud either. It just bothers me. I love Jesse, sometimes I just don't get what he expects from me. I am so tired. I haven't slept since I came to Austin. Thats probably because my bed is broken and no one has come to fix it yet. I'm really thirsty. I just walked back to campus from the capitol. Jesse bought me one of those glowing necklace things. September 11th makes me sad. I was is my chemisty class at Maypearl High School and the principal made an announcement for all of us to meet in the cafeteria. I didn't believe it at first. Why does Jesse always bug me. He likes to see how much he can annoy me. I love him, but I don't like to be bothered. I'm starting to get really sleepy. I don't want to go to class tomorrow. My freshman seminar should be a really easy class, but I don't do well speaking in front of people and I'm not very creative. I'm probably the least creative person on the planet. I want to go home. I can't wait until friday because I get to go home. Sometimes I think that I can't stand my family, but when I'm in Austin, I wish I was home with them. My roommate is out with some weird guy she met on the internet. I swear she's with a new one every day. I'm afraid something bad is going to happen to her. Raquetball is fun to play. Jesse and I were supposed to play yesterday, but we forgot. Its really hot in here. I'm usually always cold.  My contacts are bothering me. I think I need to put in a new pair. I'm really thirsty. I wonder what other people are writing about. I've always wondered what other people think about. I wonder if people think as weird of things as me. Sometimes I think really weird things and have no idea why. I really like cranberry juice. Its pretty good. I need to clean my room. My roommate and I are both really messy. It looks pretty bad. I really like frogs. I have so much frog stuff. I feel like I've been typing forever. Time seems to be going incredibly slow. A Walk to Remember is a really good movie. Sometimes I miss working at the movies. but I hated working there too. I guess that's just the way it goes. My fish are pretty cool. There salt water fish and are very pretty. I don't like it when Jesse touches me in certain places. I just don't want to be touched there. It doesn't make me feel good. But if I say anything to him about it, he gets mad, and thinks that I don't love him and don't want to mess around with him, etc. I really don't feel good. My trashbags smell like vanilla. They smell pretty good without the trash in them. Three minutes left. Yay. Jesse freaks out over the strangest things, especially anything star trek. I don't like that show. I'm don't like most things that are sci-fi. I used to though, I'm not sure why I don't anymore. Time goes by really really slow. Work is boring. I never actually do much work. Making copies isn't exactly exciting. But I'm not exactly exciting anyways. I also have no sense of humor and can be incredibly boring at times. Yay!! I'm finally done. That took forever. ",0
610,"dreams are like the screen that shows these things to me, like last night's dream--  probably shows true feelings, but more specifically, true fears. fears about who the people I know really are, and especially the way that I feel about those people deep inside. I don't like to analyze them too deeply because who knows, I might find something too true or too scary to be true. then there are fears about who I am. sometimes I admit that I am afraid of relationships and of being hurt, but sometimes I admit that that is just an excuse for being afraid of something else. sometimes my dreams will reveal things I didn't think I could feel-- sometimes there is some energy in my dreams that I can feel for days. a lot of times I say that I am by nature an independent person, I work better alone. there are some people in this world that fall apart without someone to hold their hands, but I'm not one of them. I do need my family and close friends-- I couldn't even think about living without them. but how would I be with one person who is always supposed to be there, to be mine and me to be his. my romantic side loves that and believes in that; my independent side can't handle that. but I have often heard myself say that those people that are the dependent type still need to be alone sometimes. depending on someone your entire life just leaves you helpless when you are left alone. it shoes your weakness and vulnerability. but then again I guess for some ""lucky"" people they will never be left alone. I think that it is healthier to be alone first, to establish who I am before someone else can drill in me their thoughts and beliefs. I need to be my own person before I can become somebody else's, be strongly sewn in the ground so that he can't pick me out. depending on someone, or having someone depend on you takes a part of you away. it should be two people, as separate wholes, coming together, not one part making the whole. it is good to be open-minded, and I try to be, just not easily influenced. I try to be aware of the differences in each other and accept people for those differences but at the same time not let my true self be sucked in by anything untrue. my perception of strength is just that:  though available for those who look to you, staying solid in yourself.

931,"I am so glad to be home this weekend but at the same time I really feel like crying right now. I don't know what is wrong with me . I don't want to go back to school I really hate it there. I really just wish that I could make some friends it seems like everyone already has made new friends and they don't want any more. I just can't be the type of person to go uot and meet new people. but I may not even be here next semester so what is the point of making friends if I will be at a different school in a month. atleast I have Adam there with me at school I am only happy when I am with him but I can't be with him all the time I have got to live my own life. he says that if I hate the dorm so much that I should move in with him but I am really scared to , I think because I am afraid he will get tired of me. iam also worried that if I change schools next semester that he will give upo on us and want to be with someone that he has there with him all the time. he says that he doesn't want me to leave and I believe him buthim saying that is really unfair to what I want. I am just not happy there at school and he shouldn't want me to stay there just because it makes him happy. atleast things are better now than they were when I first moved to austin . I know that I cried a lot and it was probably annoying but carrye didnt have to yell at me about it she is my friend and my roommate and she should understnad that the transistion to college is not that easy for everyone. I am scared to talk to her about anything because I am afraid she is going tro jump down my throat again. I wish I was good at talking back to people and that I wouldnt let everyone walk all over me . but I can't help it I don't know what to say to people when they trake advantage of me. I don't want to make them mad at me but what can I say . the few times that I did talk back they embarrass me by making it seem like my fault, and like I am freaking out. why are people so mean. I am so ready to just be married and have a job and live my life and not have to follow everyone's rules no one seems to understnd me but hey thats ok I don't even understand myself. I just want to be happy and I am not happy right now and now that I am home I want to go back to school because I feel to growm up and mature for my friends that are here. I will figure it all out one day  ",1
307,"*****Why does this keep going to the left instead of down a space at the end of each line Prof. Pennebaker?????************* As I sit in this library, I can't help but notice the pleasure I get from the quietness. It is the same feeling I get from sitting in a park or on a golfcourse. Perhaps even in a bookstore. The quietness provides my mind with an escape from the everyday world of horns, traffic jams, and yelling. From this feeling, my mind seems to work on a smoother track, with less obstacles to overcome before I can finish a complete thought. If the world was in a complete silence at all times, or perhaps even if I were deaf, I believe I would be wiser and would be able to formulate thoughts easier. Does this mean that deaf people actually have an easier time getting by in the world? Or is their inability to communicate too much of a burden. Maybe this is what's wrong with todayÃ¯Â¿Â½s world. Communication lines are so mixed up due to language barriers and different types of slang that the world is like one large deaf fishbowl. In that case, deaf people WOULD have an easier everyday life because they would be minus the struggles we all go through with communication. If communication were an easy things, and we all saw eye-to-eye on all issues, achieving things such as world peace, business agreements, and compromises would be no big deal. Where did the communication lines go wrong? Why did humanity branch out into hundreds of different languages and tongues when one universal language could have eliminated so many problems. The answer to that will most likely never be found. This girl sitting to my right is awfully attractive, but I can't muscle up the courage to talk to her. Is it once again the problem of communication, or does this have to do purely with a lack of courage. I would like to think it is a communication problem, but that would probably be just a lame excuse for not talking to her. Of course it is a lack of courage. Although I know she won't bite my head off, slap me, ignore me, or flat out dis me, I still am too much of a coward to begin a conversation with her. What if she knew what I was thinking right now. Would she be flattered, embarrassed, insulted, or just flat out shocked? I guess I'll never know, unless I ask her. We both know that isn't going to happen because we've already established that I'm acting like a coward right now. No big deal, there are plenty of fish in the sea. Wow! I can't believe how fast twenty minutes just went. Writing without structure is a lot more enjoyable then writing with it, and as they say: Time flies when you're having fun! ",0
383,"I called her to ask how to cook a  roast. I think it's funny how much I still depend on her - how much I still need her. I call her almost everyday. Sometimes just to hear her voice. It seems to comfort me and I don't really know why. Thank God she has a  1-800 number at her office, otherwise I would have to call collect and she probably wouldn't appreciate that. When I put the roast in the oven, I  started to think about all the meals she has ever cooked me. I wonder where she came up with all of her ideas. I only know how to cook three meals, and  they are not even that good. I wonder if my mom was born a good cook. She  probably was. That's what my dad says anyway. I kind of hope she wasn't  though, because then there might be hope for me. She told me that she taught herself. I hate when people say that. She had to have learned how somewhere. Maybe my grandmother taught her. She told me that she didn't, but she  probably did. My mom doesn't like my grandmother, so she probably doesn't  want to give her credit for anything. I guess I don't blame her. Now the  roast is starting to smell good. I love it when you come home and the whole place is filled with a mouth-watering aroma. Delicious! But it always smells the best when you're the one who is cooking. I wonder why that is. Maybe  it's because you-yourself created it. It's your own little personal accomplishment. I can't wait to taste my accomplishment. ",0

I need to do homework for math, but I don't really know how. I also don't want to go to Spanish tomorrow. I want my mom to buy me a new cell phone. I'm very glad this week is almost over. I'm excited about this weekend. I'll be very busy, but I'll have a lot of fun. I really hope that the guy I called today about buying his puppy doesn't sell it before I can have enough money to buy it. I'm so full. I shouldn't have eaten so much dinner. I hope my friend Heather isn't mad at me for not calling her back for two weeks. I really don't want to go to school anymore. I wish I was married to a professional athlete or something. I'm very tired today even though I got plenty of sleep last night. My mom is so nice, but she gets so annoying sometimes. I feel really bad for being rude to her sometimes, but she treats me like I am in junior high sometimes. Probably because I'm the baby and she misses all her kids. I wish she would get a job or something so that she'd have something to do since my dad's never there for her. Maybe Seth is home and he's calling me but he can't get hold of me because I am on the computer. Twenty minutes is a lot longer than you'd think. I don't think I have ever typed for twenty minutes straight before. The computer even thinks so. Now I'm going to have to resign online for the tenth time. Very annoying. I really just want to crawl into my bed right now. I would much rather sleep than do my homework but I guess I had better do my homework so I don't ruin my GPA. Even though I'm sure it won't be as high this semester as last year. Oh well, it's not really my fault. I really don't think all that much in my head I don't believe because I am running out of things to type. I wish that I was in the Caymans with all of my friends right now. That would be so much fun. Maybe over Christmas or something. I think that not everyone could afford it though. I am so glad that I am still on my parents' payroll. I would be nowhere without it. I can't believe some people have to pay for their tuition and things like that. I couldn't imagine, but then again most of them are married or have babies or both. I definitely could not imagine that either. I wish I could stay this age or younger forever. Preferably a freshman in college. I really didn't realize how much fun I was having until I had to grow up a year. I hope that I am doing this assignment correctly. I don't want to do badly in this class or in anything this semester. I wonder what my friends are doing right now. I don't want to wake up early tomorrow. Maybe I won't be tired. I probably will. I wish Seth would hurry up and call me. I get tired of waiting. I need to do homework for math, but I don't really know how. I also don't want to go to Spanish tomorrow. I want my mom to buy me a new cell phone. I'm very glad this week is almost over. I'm excited about this weekend. I'll be very busy, but I'll have a lot of fun. I really hope that the guy I called today about buying his puppy doesn't sell it before I can have enough money to buy it. I'm so full. I shouldn't have eaten so much dinner. I hope my friend Heather isn't mad at me for not calling her back for two weeks. I really don't want to go to school anymore. I wish I was married to a professional athlete or something. I'm very tired today even though I got plenty of sleep last night. My mom is so nice, but she gets so annoying sometimes. I feel really bad for being rude to her sometimes, but she treats me like I am in junior high sometimes. Probably because I'm the baby and she misses all her kids.

2283,"The crotheres computer lab is perhaps one of the worst on campus, but I don't really know since I have been to only three. I'm real glad that I got into the college of communications. Its unfortunate, however, that I can't spell worth anything. Jeez, I hope this writing assignment is not graded on spelling or grammar or any of that sort of nonsense. Why is it oh so hot in here? honestly, every other building on campus is freezing, but in here, I just want to wear beach clothes. I remember when I went to the beach for the first time in my life. It was this past summer. Myrtle Beach. Oh family vacations. I hope my mom and pop are doing ok at home. Since I'm gone they only have each other to yell at. no more marjon for yell fest 2004 at the rostami household. Good people. They just need to get out more. This keyboard kind of sucks too. Some of the keys get suck and it is oh so inconvenient. There we go with the spelling again. In the eighth grade my English teacher once told me that spelling is not a sign of a gifted student. At the end of the year she gave me the award for best student. Yep. English has always been a good one. I hope I make the staff of the daily Texan. They emailed me today and told me that I had to write another column. Can't they tell just how amazing I am from only one column? I guess not. I need to be more creative. Creative like all those communication kids. I'm ONE TOO!!! YAYAYAY! Yes sir, all the cool kids are communications majors. AT orientation a radio station person told me I was a cool kid. This city makes my face break out big time. My skin is horrible, and I hate having to scratch  my skin when my fingers have been typing and I most obviously have contracted all sorts of bacteria that I am now rubbing on my face. OH my face. The communications kids I interviewed with today (the Texan) had bad skin too. I think I'll fit in swell with them. If I just get in. OH man oh man oh manoh man. I really hope I make the staff. I find out on Thursday. I also have to submit another column by Thursday. I had a teacher once who had really long nasty nails and a nose ring (those weren't common until a few years ago. then everyone started getting them, including white kids. I am white. My people are from the caucus mountains and you just don't get any more caucasion than and Iranian. again with the spelling. and again with the messed up keys. I should have just gone to use the computers in the ugl or the cma or cmc, whichever one has computers. I thought not having a computer would be a major hassle, but it is pretty decent so far. knock on wood! My hands are dry. That's another think about this city, it makes my skin dry. Maybe that's why my skin is breaking out so hardcore-because it is so dry that it is producing more oils to balance out my skin tone but it just proves to be detrimental to my skin. Oh shoot. I never cared about my appearance. I was the homecoming queen. Me. not some ""popular slut. "" Man, there are so many sorority girls in this school. At the beginning of school I mistakenly walked through the area in front of the ugl and walked through a mass of girls who all looked the exact same!! WHERE IS YOUR IDENTITY LITTLE GIRL? they have none. My phone just vibrated. It could be my mom. she calls a lot now that my sister and I are out of the house all she has to talk to is my pop, and well, he is not one to talk. LAME. Or it could be some fool from my high school warning me of the fat pagan. I hate her, if it is one person who I hate it is jenny pagan: my theatre teacher for 4 years and I had her twice a day. YUCK! Jesus I hate her. I'm going back home on the 24th to crown the new queen and I might have to see her and a whole lot of people I don't want to see for the rest of my life. Including Steven, the king. My ex best friend, and my ex boy friend. (again with the spelling, I do realize all that is one word, but I am hesitant to go back an change it because I am at 18 minutes and 7 seconds right now. I love this kind of writing, we should do it all the time, always. Landon used to always say that. A good man, that Landon Phillips. Too bad some girl named Roxy had to go and taint such a good man. I had a lot of friends who were boys in high school, but not in college. Maybe that is because I live in Littlefield. Ladybugs! oh man, I like to steal the doormat and put it in front of other peoples doors. ha jokes on you ",1
1170,"I am feeling a little nervous right now. I just tried to find my class but it was not in the same spot as usual. Normally I wouldn't really care, but today this class was my excuse for not being somewhere else. I walked around for thirty minutes to three different buildings trying to find the whereabouts of this class. I never found it. Hopefully the fact that I was not in class will go unnoticed. I had a very busy day, and every little thing I do every day I have to think about twice. I can not react on impulse here in college, because if I do I could get into trouble with people I would rather not be in trouble with. If I do get in trouble it is not that big of a deal. I got my OU wristband today. I had to get up very early in order to do this. I was tired out from last night as well. I have to get up early again on Thursday in order to get my actual ticket. The OU tickets are thirty five dollars. This is pretty expensive. From what I hear it is worth it though. A lot of people have told me that this is the best weekend of the entire year. We're going to take buses to Dallas and probably stay the night at some of my new friends houses. It sounds like a blast. One of my friends from high school moved to Dallas to go to SMU for college. It will be good to see him. One of my other friends went to West Point for college. I respect the guy with all my heart. I don't know how he does what he does. I got to see on Labor Day for the first time in like three months. That was really nice. He does not think that West Point is that great, but he is the only one of my friends with enough self control to live through all that stuff. The beginning of college has been fun so far. I've had some great times, and some nerve racking ones. I enjoy living on my own. I live with three other guys from Corpus Christi. They are all really cool. I enjoy private times sometimes too. It is kind of neat when they all go to their fraternity deals, and I get the whole place to myself. It's a lot more quiet, and that is really nice sometimes. They spend pretty much every hour of every day with each other. It would be fun but every one needs a little privacy sometimes. I just got my internet connected today, so this is a nice new feature. Well it has been about twenty five minutes now so I am going to check spelling and submit my work. ",1
177,"After spending almost an hour trying to get my computer at home to work on-line, I finally got here. So what do I say?  Well, I guess everybody says that the first time that they do this assignment. I guess all that is going through my head right now is the advancement of the classroom. I am actually fulfilling an assignment by typing on the internet. I think it is pretty cool, though I am a little worried about what the future has to offer. The future is probably a real uncertain thing for me. I do not know where I will be in ten years or even ten months from now. Will college work out for me?  Will I change my major from Advertising to Design and back again or will I totally steer from the graphic arts which I so dearly love and take up a new love or hidden talent. Well, I do not know. I guess that it is all the future really is to me, just a bunch of questions with unclear and vague answers. It is probably the same way for everyone else, at least I hope. What else do I want to type on my new fancy Compaq laptop?  I don't know? As I ponder this a song I heard today keeps coming out and no matter what I do I cannot get it out of my head. And as the case always is I can only remember a few lines, while I try to hum the rest. ""Blue skies -- all of them gone -- nothing but blue skies from now on"" and that is all I can remember. When I come to think of it I really never heard this song today or anything, it just popped into my head. It is from With Honors, my most favorite movie of all time. I don't no whether it is the actors I like, the music, or the emphasis on Walt Whitman, one of my favorite poets, along with everybody else. Everytime I take a pause the song starts coming into my head again. When I really listen to the words of the song it is talking about your future, pretty coincidental, I might add. It is almost scary!  But that is what I am going to have in my future, nothing but ""blue skies"". I think that that is too optimistic for my blood. I am usually the glass-is-half-empty-kind-of-guy. And I do not know -- DARNIT I HIT THAT CAPS LOCK BUTTON FOR THE MILLIONTH TIEM AGAIN. I hat that when I am typing really fast and the ideas are flowing and then -WAM- you hit the caps lock button or some other button  that makes you take time and fix what is in caps or something else. To totally get off the subject or anything, but it is a really beautiful day out, today. If it wasn't so hot outside I probably would be outside right now, instead of in here typing this - whatever it is?  Speaking of being hot. It just me or does it just keep getting hotter as you walk all the way across campus for a class. Well I guess it is better than rain. I always want the grass on the other side of the fence -- my mother says to me all the time. I informed her the other day that I was going to have a better life when I become rich and famous. As I soon found out that I shouldn't have brought up this subject to my mother, because she spouted for the millionth time that the ""Grass is not always greener on the other side. ""  I totally do not agree with that. I just told her that I want things to be better and that you always need to strive for the best and I think that there is nothing wrong with that. My hands are starting to hurt!  I think I am going to stop. I feel sorry for the person who has to sit down and read this. Well I bid you farewell. And may all your skies be blue! ",1
426,"Well my leg kind of hurts. Last night while Caitlin was out with Jonathan, I spilled my ver hot tea on my leg. It hurt like hell. When she came back I was laying on my bed with a frozen dinner meal on my leg. The burn is on my right upper thigh. It really hurt when I took a shower last night to. Today it doesn't hurt as much, but it has this really huge blister on it. I don't know if I should pop the blister, or what, so emailed my mom. She works nearby off of Windsor. I wonder if she misses me as much as miss her. ? I guess I'm quite a home body, because I live only 20 minutes. away yet I miss everything around my house. I especially miss Stephen. He's this guy I've had a crush on for like forever. When I was a sophomore at Westwood, he was a junior, and we ended up in the same physics class, anyway he was on the soccer team then and I thought he was cute. I need to pluck my eyebrows, and these desk chairs here at jester suck. I can't even sit cross legged. rruugh. This place is beginning to smell too. I don't know why, but it is like you can't shake it, its everywhere. Back to Stephen. We work together. Have for the past two summers. It's kind of funny because I don't even remember really thinking about him until the end of the summer, but this summer. we were friends from the start. I wanted more, but he never acted on it, it's just as well though considering I have a boyfriend and all. Well I don't know if I love Stephen, but I sure as hell miss him terribly. I almost cried the first day here. I missed him and everything so much. I gave him my email address, but I suppose he has better things to do than to talk to me. Maybe he doesn't have a computer!? wishful thinking. oh well, I get to see him at Thanksgiving that's only say 4-5 months away. Sucks. He isn't even that cute, and he can be such a pain in the butt too. Well, I'm going home this weekend because I have to go to the company picnic. I should leave on Friday, but, I don't know what I was going to say Andy just I'M'd me. oh yeah, I want to go home for a bit, but I don't know if I'll miss a bunch of things happening here. I'd ask what do you think, but you can't answer me. Alan. He's my boyfriend, we've been together for about eight months now. I love him I truly do, but sometimes he is not very exciting like I know him to well or something. That is probably why I am attracted to Stephen. He's new, parties has goofy friends. I wanted to kiss him goodbye, but that would be wrong plus, he probably doesn't even think of me that way then I would just be embarrassed. I don't know what to do about him, but I should seriously think of something soon , I've been saying this all summer. But really it is beginning to effect my relationship with Alan. The electricians are driving me crazy with their drills. They woke me up the first day I was here, and they've been at it ever since. I tried to take a nap today but couldn't because they are too noisy. Alan should drop by soon. I hope at least because I have a feeling I'm going to get bored in this place soon. Caitlin is laying on her bed doing her homework I think. I can't believe I'm in college. I don't feel old enough. I think I can handle it though. I don't wont to gain the freshman 15 though. Stephen did. I want to look good, great when all the people come back from college for Labor Day or Thanksgiving I guess I should go to the gym. I need to sign up for some class but need money in my bank account to do it. I also need to sign up for APO's a  service frat. I hope they pick me I'd be crushed if they didn't. Especially if Caitlin got in and I didn't. She is in so many clubs and organizations. I think I should got to some things. I should probably sign up soon. ",0
741,"It's Sunday and I need to go to church since I didn't go this morning because I woke up at 11:15 and church is at 11:30. So I already took a shower and I'm dressed to go at 8:00 p. m. Right now it's 7:25 and I wish it was about 4 because it seems like the day has just went by and I haven't done very much. That's alright though because I'm listening to my favorite rap music. Trick Daddy Dollars, Ja Rule, DMX, Ice Cube, Hot Boys, Juvenile, Black & Dangerous, K-ROC, Too Short, Twista, and JT Money they seem to make me feel better. Even if I'm feeling down in the dumps a few rap songs seem to bring me back to reality and happiness. Earlier my girlfriend called and we had a serious fight because she gave my roommate a little attitude yesterday when she called. She got mad because I was not here and my roommate didn't know my cell number or my friend's which is where I was at. So I had to lay down the law and tell her not to take out her anger on my roommate. I was mad also because I gave her my cell number the day before but she didn't write it down. So we argued for a while about that then she told me something that her and her friend did that I didn't approve of. So I was instantly angered because I have a short temper to begin with. It was a big deal really but I don't let anything go by even the smallest fuckups. So we started to have any even greater argument than the first one and didn't end on a good note. She decided that she didn't want to talk to me if we were going to argue. I acted like I didn't care so we just ended it there. This worries me because I hate to end it like that but I'm so hardheaded that I won't let anyone know that they're really hurting me. It also hard because I'm here and she's 355 miles away and I can't see her the way I use to. I guess I'm going to have to get use to this and college is a lot different from what I'm use to. The girls wooo some of them are pretty fine and all the people I've never seen so many people in one place at one time. Being from a small town this is a totally different atmosphere that I'm not used to. Hopefully I'll find my place here make the best of it and things will turn out great. I don't want to let college change me in the wrong ways. Whatever happens I'll just try to do my best and do the best I can as things come along. ",0
1694,"I have been feeling so different when I arrived here at UT. I just can't believe that I graduated from high school and now here at college. The atmosphere is different here. I feel like I belong here. When I first arrived here at UT,I was scared. I was afraid about how am I going to get from class to class. It's just different here. I'm worried about the exams. There's only 4 exams per class. I'm not used to that. I guess I'm used to spoon feeding from high school. UT is just soooooo huge. I didn't know that UT was this big after orientation. I'm just afraid of my classes. I'm afraid that I'm going to fail. I feel like I'm slacking off. I do my homework and read, but I still feel like I'm failing. I guess I have high standards for myself. I want to score the best that I can get. I'm just afraid that I'm going to drop out of UT. As long as I push myself to stay on top of things then I'll be ok. After the   Gone to Texas  , I feel like I choose the right college. I definitely felt like fit in. My major is Nursing. I kind of lost in finding a major. When I was a kid, you would dream about what you wanted to be. I always said that I wanted to be a doctor. Now, when I think about my future I don't know what I want to be. I volunteered in a hospital and I notice that the nurses are so nice to they're patients. I want to be one of those. I want to be the one who helps out and put a smile on the patients. I want to work with children. After nursing school, I want to become a nurse practitioner. It's just like a register nurse but higher. A nurse practitioner gets to prescribe medication. That's almost like a doctor. Everybody is like   why don't you want to be a doctor?   I'm afraid of malpractice suits. I'm just  My dream is to work at the Texas Children's Hospital in Houston. It's close to home and I like working with kids. They are so much fun. I just hope that I can make it through school. College life is just so different. I miss my parents and my brother. I went back home during the Labor Day weekend. I miss my mom's home cooking. What's weird is that when I left college, my parents got a little puppy.      ",0
694,"right now I am worried because I just submitted a blank form. I pressed the tab button and instead of moving the cursor it highlighted the submit button. When I started to type it send a blank assignment. Oops. I want to play football for the longhorns I watched football all day today and now I am ready to take the field. My stomach is about to burst. The never ending pasta bowl at The Olive Garden is hurtin me. The Astros won their tenth in a row. Sosa didn't hit any homers. This might be one of the weirdist assignments I have ever had. I wish the tests were like this. I would have an A. Writing for this class has caused me to remember how to beat the lie detector test. Squizing the sphincter has got to be the way to go. My roomate was hit on by a homosexual this weekend. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but it made him feel a little aukward. I am way behind in all of my classes. I am writing this on the day before the extended due date. I have to read so many chapters in every class I think my eyeballs are going to fall out. My chest itches. I am tired of typing and I still have twenty more minutes on the second writing assignment to finish. It is about eleven forrty five at night and I am ready to sleep on my concrete bed. It is negative thirty in my room. I wake up with a runny nose every mourning. My breath stinks. It smells like Italian food. Our waiter tried to make conversation with us tonight. He ask where we went to school and if we played sports. We told him that we were freshman at UT and that we lost our scholorships due knee injuries. He started to laugh and replied with "" yeah, I remember high school, playing sports and smoking joints!""  High class service. Times up. ",0
1175,"Now I've really come to see that life would be much better once you're gone. This is a good song. Only girls like it though. Bye Bye Bye. Fool for you. I don't feel this way about Jason at all. I am really in love with him. I can't let my parents know. I don't like hiding the way I feel from them but they would never like Jason if they knew I loved him so much. I am looking at our picture right now. That is the picture that I looked at the whole time I was in Europe. He looks so good but it seemed like I almost forgot what he looked like after a month. Just looking at that picture wasn't enough. I'll never be able to tell him what happened. I love him too much. If I really love him that much, would I have done it? I think it was something I had to do to get that nasty feeling to go away. I don't regret anything. I still can't get adjusted to this new college life. I guess it will take more time. I know I'll love it soon. I always want Jason to be here when he's not and when he's here I feel like he's tying me down. He is really understanding about my adjustment though. I jut hate it when he gives me a guilt trip. He also thinks he superior to me too much. Whether it be with sex or life experience. He has experienced more than me but there are a lot of things that I know better than him. He doesn't think that. That is all the complaints I have about him. God, I am totally in love with him. What did he do that captured me? His looks defiantly were the reason at first. He feel in love me much sooner than I fell in love with him. I'm still catching up and now I am put in the setting where I have a lot of other options. I still choose him over anyone. There isn't another guy that has all his qualities. I have defiantly not seen anyone as hot as him. He's gorgeous to me. I miss my parents. I wish I didn't have to so secretive with Jason around them. They know how I feel, just they don't know how much. It bothers them already and they don't even really know. How am I supposed to tell them? I want them to get along with him. I think someday they will  once they realize how I feel they'll support anything I decide. Looking at Jason and me compared to Erich and Lisa is weird. I can't see how Lisa loves Erich judging by the way they fight. They'd never make it. Jay and I never fight unless it's over something really dumb and then we forget about it two seconds later. Maybe its cause we don't see each other as much. That is going to change because we're so much closer. Lisa and Erich fight more now that they're apart. It sucks for her and me for that matter because I hate the way she's always upset. It will end soon and she'll get over it. ",0
184,"I just sat down at a computer in the lobby of srd, which is where I live. I just finished checking my e-mail since my computer in my room has not yet been equipped with an Ethernet. My boyfriend e-mailed me because he just got home. He goes to Baylor. He hates it there, though, and wants to transfer here in the spring. I am perturbed by the method of typing this computer is set up with. why doesn't it automatically wrap to the beginning on the visible screen. sorry, I can be really anal at times. I am sorry if this looks messed up, but I couldnÃ¯Â¿Â½t figure out how this works. sorry again. I sure am glad this isn't going to be graded, or else my body paragraph would get an ""f"". I really miss my boyfriend. I am nervous about my dance-team tryout today. I don't know if I am in good enough shape to make the team. I haven't danced in like four months, and I am really out of shape. I am adjusting pretty good I guess to the whole college experience. I have made many new friends , and already have done things with them. for example, my friend heather and I are going shopping at the mall at 4 to get my boyfriend a birthday present. I am misspelling words right and left huh. I am kinda excited about learning psychology. the brain chapter, I hear, is confusing, but all of the case studies should be interesting  I have no more classes today, but I need to finish reading my chapter one in psych. and my chapter two in chemistry. My boyfriend cam for a visit this weekend. I think he had a good time. We went out to eat at El arroyos, which was rumored to have good Tex-Mex food. They were right, alright. some of the best I've ever tasted. we then went to comedy sports, an improv club at northcross mall. it was hysterical. the members of the teams respond to impromptu suggestions from the audience. He stayed with friends at towers and called me the minute he woke up on Saturday. he came over to srd and  we went shopping on the drag. I got two T-shirts, a baseball cap, and two books from the co-op. he got some u. t. memorabilia to take home with him to try and persuade his parents to let him come here in the spring. he is going to have a tough time explaining it to them, I think, because they will undoubtedly think that the only reason he wants to come here is because IÃ¯Â¿Â½m here. I don't know how much weight that pulls in his decision, but I hope that isn't the basis for his decision. he started out at Baylor because they are said to have a good pre-med program, which is ultimately his goal. he met with the hpo office while he was here, and met with an advisor about the science program here. he was impressed that it was so similar to Baylor's. We then went over to the admissions office so that he could meet with someone about credits needed to transfer and other such items. He needs 24 hours to transfer, and after fall he will have 26, so he hopes to be accepted as a transfer student. Amy just walked in and said Hi!. now she looked at my screen I'm not crazy, I am doing stream of consciousness assignment for pschology. as she nods. she is a nice girl. she lives down the hall from me.  I needed to get this done today because I have plans for the rest of the week after Wednesday, since this is a two day assignment. I should've recorded what time I started typing, huh!  that would have been beneficial. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m retarded in that sense. i mean sometimes I have no common sense. I wonder what my grades will be like this semester. I am used to straight AÃ¯Â¿Â½s, and I hope I can accomplish this in college as well. I need to petition my AP grades sometime soon, but I don't know when or where. oh, well, IÃ¯Â¿Â½ll look it up somewhere, and get it done. I need to do some laundry today, too. I am running out of plain little T-shirts, what's a girl to do. maybe IÃ¯Â¿Â½ll find something cute while IÃ¯Â¿Â½m shopping today. I hoe my boyfriend ( jaron is his name, if you wanted to know) likes his present. i think I am going to get him a ring from james avery and have it engraved. always. that is what I am engraving into it. so he'll remember. I am kinda sore from my dance class this morning. all we are doing is stretching but it takes alot out of me. I need to take a shower this evening sometime, cuz I am still kinda sweating from walking from like the stadium back home. in case you didn't know I live at 27th and the drag, so its a good hike to and from classes. I think I have been typing for twenty minutes so I am going to submit this. I wonder what happens if I didn't type for twenty minutes. what if I don't get credit. maybe IÃ¯Â¿Â½ll keep going for another minute. I checked my mailbox when I came in, and I didn't have any new packages. my dad supposedly sent one on Friday, but it hasn't arrived yet. I think I am running out of things to say, so IÃ¯Â¿Â½ll let you go on to whoever's paper is next in line. ",1
2344,"     last night I laid down and I Couldn't go to sleep for anything. sleep would be nice right now, I have class all day today. my classes are pretty cool though. I have music psychology and ceramics. I'm good at ceramics though cause I got grounded a lot in high school. high school was fun. I have a lot of great memories. I miss my friends sometimes, but it was time to move on. I feel more free, no one knows you or anything you can do what you want and be who you are. I am finally realizing the value of that too. I think its the art . I love art its constantly running thorough my head. The way I look at everything, the way I find beauty and perspective in simple and complex things, the way I am so attracted to things that are gorgeous. not only on the outside but personalities for example and music. I am going to incubus on Wednesday and they are brilliant. its cool too cause my homework for music class is to go to a concert anyways. my music class meets too often . 4 days a week. that shit is ridiculous. I feel like I am taking 15 hours but I'm just taking 12, which allows for a job. I am going to work at the frank Erwin center hopefully . I was a waitress this summer at el Chico. I love Mexican food. I am so damn hungry right now. oops can I cuss? oh well. my stomach is rumbling and I felt it necessary. I feel tired and hungry and event the sound of punching these keys is annoying but the relief of finishing this assignment is un-explainable believe me. lately I've been dead set on being responsible and I am hell bent on making all A's , so when I can make a check on the 'old to do list, its like its lifted from my shoulders and that no joke. my back hurts so bad every day from stress. its actually kind of funny that in class we talked about the correlation between stress and the immune system because I was stressed to hell the first couple weeks of school and a couple of weeks before with bills and work and money , etc. and I could not get over a dinky little cold for 3 weeks, and now that I've gotten into the scheme of things its so much easier. its so much easier just being a sophomore in general. I remember when I moved into the dorms my freshmen year. we moved everything in and I remember after my dad left standing there looking around. I had no phone, no friends, and no clue and I think it was the scariest moment of reality in my life. but when I look back I have learned that you can't always know everything at that second. you have to give yourself time to grow and learn and not be so anxious to know it all. what is this an autobiography? I don't know I am just writing as I go along. I like to write. I write often actually, sort of like this but mainly about things no one but me cares about. I like to vent, I NEED to vent. its almost like when I write something down it jumps from my mind and onto the paper and is no longer stressing me out. I don't know maybe I'm weird. I wish I could find really unique ways of expressing myself, so I do poetry as well. but I am getting bored with this subject so lets jump to another. how about love? I am in love. I am not quick to say that either and it is not something I was trying to do or even wanted, but I have found  my soul mate believe  it or not. he is perfect, and believe me I am not naive. he is the most unique person in the world ( maybe its the ADHD ) and I love his mind because I appreciate things I cannot understand myself or find how its done, and he fascinates me. really all I want is to be fascinated, and to laugh. I love to laugh. you know those times when you just laugh your ass off so hard you cry. man that's the best. seriously. that's why I like to surround myself with people who make me laugh. I make myself laugh too. I am quite lonely during the day and end up having to entertain my head with humorous thoughts. or just dress weird and laugh inside when people give me weird looks. I love that. ",0
1929,"right now, I am in a really good mood, I don't really know why because this morning I was so dead, and I thought I would feel like that all day, but I woke up sometime between biology and economics. last night sucked. everyone else was having so much fun, but I was exhausted and just couldn't really get into it. I don't know how people do it every night!  I am so worn out every day!  I just need to take a few days off to sleep. I am so mad that our zeta retreat is the weekend of austin city limits!  I have to get out of it somehow. my stomach kind of hurts right now, and I really need to go running, so I hope it goes away. my friend megan has an eating disorder I think. she constantly tells us how much weight she is lost recently, and its getting so annoying. I really miss zachary. thank god he called and woke me up this morning or else I would have never woken up. and I really miss my dog. I think I have an unhealthy relationship with my dog. thank god I'm taking psychology. haha I literally miss her more than my parents!  I hope fiji is fun tonight. it probably will be. I always have the most fun with the fiji guys. they are so nice and fun to hang around with. it is such a nice day outside. I would much rather be out enjoying it then writing this. just kidding!  it was not cool last night when so many people came into my room and woke me up! I was in such a deep sleep too! no wonder I was tired this morning. okay now my roommate is going outside. just like I wanted to!  she is cool as shit. she is just so herself, and I think that's awesome. sometimes I wish I could be more like that. I am a fairly independent person, but I know I follow the trend a lot too. I hope I do well at the tryouts for the dance team. that would be so cool! I miss dance so much!  I can't believe I quit - I am such an idiot! dance was always such an outlet for me and when I quit, things kind of started going downhill, so hopefully I can start back up. I seriously think I've gained the freshman 100!  for some reason when I get stressed out I start to eat. a lot. I need to get control!  I think its so funny how all of the girls from hardin house and srd are constantly at towers. I love living here, it is so free and fun all the time. it's so weird how music means so much to some people and so little to others. I think I'm kind of in between. I love music, but it certainly isn't my life. there are definitely times in my life when music plays a key role. ugh. cooper, why did he become so annoying!?  he used to be so funny and nice. I wonder what my sister is doing right now. I miss her about the same as I miss my pooch. she is so sweet. I hope she is okay. I worry about her all the time, I just hope she is okay. it worries me how introverted she is. I am the complete opposite!  I spill my guts to anyone that will listen and she won't open up to anybody. I know that she is going through a really hard time right now with mom and papa, and with me leaving. god she looked up to me so much :(  I really need to stretch. I think running will be good for me today. I need to burn off some steam for sure. I wonder how molly is doing. I haven't talked to her in awhile. I feel bad because she called me a lot when school started, and I was always so busy and couldn't' ever call her back. now she hasn't been answering when I call, so I hope she is at least having fun. I bet she is met so many hot colorado guys. why can't I find a guy?  they are all so worthless. all the freshmen guys care about right now is pledging and getting a piece of ass. both of which I am not going to do right now. well except for pledging. duh. zeta. why didn't I get my first choice!  I really want to know what I did wrong. all of my friends got their first choice, and I am really nice and outgoing, it should have been a breeze. why did I spill my guts that night about it to nathan. I am such a dumbass. oh well, it happens to the best of us. well time to go run! ",1
1935,"Well, lets see, what am I thinking. All I ever really have time to think about is school. I am so stressed out, since I changed to pre-pharm my courses have completely changed, I'm reading for hours each day and I'm not a big reader"", I read very slow, and I have absolutely no reading comprehension what so ever. To top it all off I have three tests on the same day, this one is two days before that and I have another one the thursday before that. Talk about brain overload. One thing that's good is that a lot of the science stuff I'm reading in all 3 classes and some of it I'm finding in my psych readings too. It's all just overwhelming. This week I have to do all this lil sis stuff for my sorority. I was supposed to decorate her room yesterday but I had class from 12-5 so she was home when I was done with class, so I'll be doing that later and I have to buy all this stuff for it too, I don't have a job, I don't make money, and I don't feel like I should ask my parents for more. The big money problem started with my boyfriend, he owes me $700, that's a lot of money I could really use. I could maybe go and do something for myself, go out to eat occasionally, go rent a movie once and a while but no, I have all this other crap I have to pay for like bills and he can't understand that. He is not in school, he should a job, why to I have to loan him money, well no more-EVER. Well at least not until I get my money back. To top it all off he messed up something with probation and now he is in jail, I don't a boyfriend who's in jail, I want someone with my same goals in mind, someone in school, someone who cares about where they'll be in 5-10 years. But it's so hard because I love him, or at least I think it's love, it has to be or else I wouldn't put up with all his crap. It's not just all that, I'm somewhat of a neat freak and I like things to be clean and keep things the way I have them but everytime he does something that upsets me and not just that, it's stuff I've asked to either do or not do hundreds of times and he somehow thinks that he can get mad because I'm mad at him, well if would listen to me and try to clean up after himself and common courtesy things like that I would even get upset. Now he keeps saying are things going to ok when I get out blah, blah, blah. I don't know if things don't think at least somewhat better than I can't put myself through this anymore, the stress he causes is probably close to or equal to what I get from school, I don't need that-school is a big enough pain in my side. I should probably end it, I know I won't cry-I'll miss him but I've already cried enough for him. You know the saying-the only guy worth crying for will never make you cry. I don't know we'll just have to see what things are like. One good thing that came from him is my kitty, Bailey. One of his friends couldn't keep her so I took her. She is the cutest most mischievous thing ever. I feel so bad though, she got spayed and declawed on monday. She is doing better she is walking almost completely back to normal, not really limping anymore but I still feel bad, I didn't do it to hurt her but I know sometimes she is in pain. That was pretty costly too, she is an expensive little thing but hopefully that'll be the last big thing I have to do for her. She is about 6 months but she is still relatively small, I'm hoping she will be a petite kitty and not get too big. The world's biggest cat weighed 87 pounds, I can't believe that some girls at school probably weigh around that size. I just think that's incredible. Wow, my hands are starting to hurt from typing, good thing this is almost over, and done. ",1
941,"Throughout my life I have experienced many important events in which have shaped the way of my future. for example, when first arriving at UT I was awe-inspired by the size of the campus, and the enormous amounts of students which attended. I was shocked by the different races which represented each other. I could tell that everyone was already forming their own little ""clicks"", whether it was based on their interests in music, race, sex, sexual orientation, everyone was already making new friends, and social gathering were taking place. While everyone was socializing I was busy worrying about the classes that I was taking, the assignments that were supposed to be done in classes that I had. I was lonely, I was scared, and being from a large city, I was trying to adapt to an even larger one. although UT is a beautiful campus it offers more than just a decent education it offers a variety of things, for example, the opposite sex,new friends, and just having a good time, while at the same time, studying. I knew coming to UT that I would have a good education, but I needed a way to find myself, who I was, and what I wanted to study, I came to UT wanting to be a doctor, but I figured that it may not be something I wanted to do. perhaps becoming a professor would strike my fancy, at some time in my college education, but whatever it is that I may become I want it to be something that I am going to be happy doing. I realized that high school is much different that college. college is much more demanding, and time consuming. but in the end it will even out someday. When I was a child I had dreams of being a great military leader. a policeman. a astronaut. or a physicist. as of now I don't know what I want to become I'm still trying to find something that will interest me greatly. as a child I always wanted to do something that related to the field of science thats why I wanted to become a doctor. but now that I'm in psychology I've realized that it is much more than the study of the mind. but how it works and functions. in science I have always wanted to contribute something that will interest others. for example in psychology, it would be interesting to someday find a cure to depression. or just find a way to make everyone happy, in the event that I would someday accomplish something like this, I would make sure that everyone would reap the rewards of a healthy lifestyle. knowing that I have contributed something to the art of science would be enough for my to tell my grandchildren one day. now that I am more relaxed here at UT it is easier for me to meet new people and get around campus faster. finding the shortcuts. and finding which classes are the best. all the time when I first discovered what comes along with a great education. i have also figured out that I can become whatever I want to be. just as long as I put my mind to it. and test out my skills as a academian. coming to UT I knew would offer a lot of new and important things to me. i knew that with hard work and determination. i could accomplish whatever I wanted to. conquering my thoughts has been something that has always been a goal of mine. overpowering myself, knowing that I can't always tell myself what to do all the time. and just let my unconscious mind take over. often times when I become depressed I find that it is easier to listen to soothing music. talking with a friend. or playing chess with a friend. or playing cards with them. at times I just want to take a walk or listen to the outside or hear the rain as it pours down so easily. when I do find myself depressed I always try and do something productive so that it will get off my mind. and think about other things. such as playing basketball. playing baseball. or like I said playing a good game of chess with my friends. i havent quite yet found my niche at UT but it will come someday. and I too will find my interests in academics. and find something that I truly love doing. whether it be my major now. such as biology or even psychology. as a kid I remember pouring through my fathers materials. because he to was a psych major and he understood how the mind worked and how we get along with our environments. and how we socially interact on a daily basis with nature. all along I thought I always knew what I wanted to do when I got older but I guess its an answer I will learn in time. ???

1562,"    I am sitting in my dorm room right now, trying to think of something to write about. Although the instructions recommend that we don't do any thinking first, I'm still going to think as I write this intro. You see, it's my birthday today, and so I could write about that, but really that's kind of boring. I'm taking a girl I like to a party tonight - I guess that might be more interesting. Or maybe I should just talk about how my parents really piss me off.          Since about the third month of my senior year, we've actually gotten along much better. But before that, damn, it was a war zone in our house. They would bitch about anything, seriously. I mean, I had great testing scores, brought home good grades, didn't get in much trouble, and they still treated me like dirt. My friend Jackson once told me I should get in a lot of trouble. Then, although it would suck for a while because they were mad at me, in the future they would appreciate my good behavior. For some reason I never got the courage up to do this and continued to try and hide any activities that they would approve of. But, he was right. When they received a call from the police during my junior year, it paved the way for me to ameliorate our relationship throughout my senior year.        Okay, new topic. When I was over at my friend Alex's house one day, this kid pulls out Alex's . 22 rifle. I'm like,   Dude, don't point that at me, turn it away.   He listens, and he starts pointing it at Alex. Alex is pretty quiet most of the time, so he didn't say much. This kid is pointing the rifle at Alex, making shooting noises, while Alex is playing a Nintendo game. For some reason, I had a really bad feeling. This was not a toy - it was a gun. POP!  All of a sudden it went off. The thing was, the kid was at such close range, Alex couldn't even feel the blast. I had to tell him he was spurting blood out the side of his head. I ran to call the ambulance, and I think this other dude went to look for bandages and stuff. Anyway, because of that and one other incident that was even more frightening (but too complex to describe here), I've never liked guns.          My phone's ringing right now, but I'm not going to pick it up since I'm doing this assignment. You know, I bet it's someone calling to wish me a happy birthday. That's so boring. I like the idea of randomly exchanging gifts with people you care about because it means more if you're not expecting it. Looking at the timer, it's about time to wrap things up. I'm not going to take the time to edit this, since it was a stream of consciousness. But thanks for listening and I'll catch you on the flip side.        ",1
1550,"     Now I am really annoyed. I already typed a stream of consciousness for 20 minutes. But when I clicked on Finish, it had an error. I have to do this entire thing AGAIN. ARG. It is almost 1 am and I'm really tired. But I can not go to sleep or feel accomplished until I finish this. This is exactly why computers are annoying. They have problems, and if you did not save your work. Everything you did before is totally lost. I just finished filling out the forms for crew. My hand is already a little sore from signing so many forms and such. I think Emily just got offline. Vivek just Im'ed me. He rarely im's me anymore. We used to be best freinds, but now things are just weird between us. He once confessed that he loved me, but I didn't feel the same way. So I reacted badly and got mad at him. I felt that he was ruining our friendship, which is exactly what ended up happening. So now he and I both have our own boyfriend and girlfriend, but it's just not the same. Otto just imed me too. I want to talk to him. And he should have been able to call 15 minutes ago since I was SUPPOSED to be done with this assignment already. But NO. the stupid internet and connection had to go crazy on me. I do kind of wonder if the TA's now have to read TWO of my writings. Oh well. I'm too lazy. I'm so tired. I walked and started training for rowing. At least I'm not as scared anymore since the girls did not look any different from me. So we are all in the same boat. I just have this fear of being too buff. But I do need to work out and get more fit. If i don't make the rowing team, I think i will try to join the newspaper. I used to be on yearbooks, I still have to submit my application for officer for CTSA. Too much to do. People say how college students shouldn't overwhelm themselves teh frist year. But i personally think that the first is the best and more important year. So I should be going out, trying out everything that i possibly can. And then later i can decide which select few clubs/orgaizations/activites are important to me. I did almost everything my freshman year in high school, but by my senior year it was reduced to just debate, orchestra, NHS, and STAND. Hopefully I can do the same thing for college. But, with more pretigous titles so I can get a good job. I think life is redundant. All we do it work, eat, and sleep. Honestly, what is the purpose of life? We live it to teh fullest extent, but still what is the point. I can join thousands of clubs and do thousands of activies and be the richest person alive and most powerful. But in the end, we all die. Nothing is any different. Humans are humans, and we just seem to have no real purpose. I guess thats too deep of a question to be thinking of this late. But I always think the most right before I go to sleep. My mind always goes on overdrive. And i suddenly think/contemplate things that I would not have during the day. Yes, EMily is offline. She didn't even bother to IM me. It bothers me that she just uses me and I let her. Maybe I should just ignore her, but who knows. I've known her too long to give up our werid love-hate friendship that we have. I'm afraid that this writing assignment is going to be judged and graded also from our grammer and spelling, and punctuation. Mine is really bad. I have so many typos and such because when I bother to backspace and correct my mistakes, I lose my train of thought. I always seem to think faster than I can type. I think it's the same for everyone else too. I love this song by The sky is blue, baby i love you. . Martina McBride's song is so pretty. I love happy songs. emotioanlly attracted, physically active. the lyrics are going to be stuck in my head later, I just know it. Baby I love you. sigh, I still have 5 more minutes. My brain is getting tired of thinking or trying to slow down my thoughts to the point where I can type them all down. My roommate isn't in the room right now. She's never here at night, but she takes so many naps during the day. It's very odd. Her schedule is screwed up. But at least I don't have to worry about bothering her from all my loud typing. I'm sure it must sound really annoying. She doesn't even have a computer. I don't understand how she can stand that. I live and breathe for my computer, even though I am totally computer illiterate. I had to have my boyfriend and guy friends show me how to download music. My younger sister is even better with computers than me. Hopefully my MIS310 class will teach me more about computers so I do nt always feel so incompetant. And then I will also learn how to make my own web-page. I think that sounds like a lot of fun. This seems to be a lot to read. I wonder if the TA's actually read everyone's   essay.  Or maybe they just give us a check for completion. I dont' remember what the instructor said in class. Sometimes I get my classes mixed up. Thats why I have to color code everything, and orgainze my stuff. I am such a neat freak. My roommate is really messy and it bothers me. But not as much as I would have thought it would. She keeps it on her side, so it's not too bad. But I also have to LOOK at her side of the room. I try to sit and face my side of the room since its so much prettier. HEHE, i think that sounded really conceited. Not to  ",1
581,"Well today is my birthday and I am excited. I turn 19. I am no longer just 18 and not quite 21 but somewhere in the middle. Today, I go up at 12:00 in the afternoon. I hate having to wake up so late because my day feels as if it is half gone. I guess that is why I'm here in the computer lab trying to complete these assignments. I am a little disappointed in myself because this assignment was originally due on Friday, but because some people were having difficulty with the computers the deadline was extended to Monday. That is great. I felt awkward because I had not completed the assignment not because I had computer problems but because I was to lazy to do the assignment. I have one problem I think in life and that is that I have too many friends. That seems like a weird thing to say, but it is true. I came to Austin with not one single friend or any family up here and for some reason I have many friends. I ask my friend Jina, do I look like a people-person, because people are just coming up to me and wanting to be my buds. I think that is so great. Most people would usually get very nervous and would not try to continue an conversation with complete strangers, but I try. Once you make the effort to reach put to people you will realize that there is a lot of people wanting to be your friend. I did something in the cafeteria the other day. I was running a way different schedule than my other friends, so I went to the cafeteria alone. I was thinking to myself, great I have to just eat and not talk to anyone. I was not going to do that so I say this guy sitting by himself. He looked decent and it wasn't as if I had any physical attraction to him. I just sneezed right now, two times. No one said bless you. I just thought that was weird. Any was back to my story. I went and sat down with him and we ate dinner together. It turns out that he is from San Antonion also. wow  So I see him every now and then and we say hi to each other. I know this guy, his name is Carlitos. His is the coolest. Everywhere we go he knows someone. He goes to school at SWT but he knows people at UT and UTSA. I want to be someone who has friends everywhere. I have been doing a successful job so far, considering that I'm a freshman. I really like it here at UT. I am making friends, doing reasonably well in my classes, I have an easy job at the MIC in the SSB. To me the SSB is a great building and I talk about it everyone should know but everyone doesn't know about it and I think that is interesting. A building designed to help students and many don't know about it. I understand that the freshman don't know about it but  professors and upperclass students don't know about the SSB. My hands are tired of typing and I have 5 minutes left to write. I like this psy class except that I want to fall asleep in the class. I probably should of scheduled the class for an earlier time. actually I that I think about it I did try but TEX was not working to my favor so I stayed with that time. I hope I get accepted to do the experiments because I surely do not want to do a research project. Tonight we plan on drinking some beer and having some pizza for my birthday. Last night when the clock struck 12:00 midnight, my best friend from school poured beer on me. We also dropped ashes from each others cigarette into each others beer and drank it. That is our new tradition we will carry on for years. Jeanie is a great friend. I wish she would come to UT instead of     SWT, I know she wants to . well time is up so BYE.    ",0
2454,"  When I got online tonight I was prompted with an instant message from an unknown person. The person, aka MuffinCheeseqn, asked me if they remembered me from last night. Last night! Last night I was with Sarah, my roomie, watching Shrek! I was totally freaking out. I was telling Sarah that I had a stalker! This ""MuffinCheeseqn"" kept telling me that they were beginging to get to know me better so they wanted me to keep talking to them. Talk about freaky! Well finally a message box came up stating that it was one of my friends that had played a joke on me. What a friend! It ended up being my roomie's cousin! 'Lil punk! Anyhoo, that made my night though. I've been over at my friend Danny's dorm working on a computer science program that is due tomorrow. I've been there since 5! I don't like the first program and I'm majoring in CS! What was I thinking! They should have a major in learning the ABCs! Oh man its only been 5 minutes. Man, I think Sarah needs to be quiet so I can concentrate on this writing assignment! lol! So Sarah has some pretty cute guys in her classes! I've seen some although she has failed to introduce me to them! OO I just remembered that I need to finish the pre-screening for the experiment requirements cause I really don't want to write a five page paper! I'm not very good at writing papers. Obviously! I'm not very good at calculus either. Although, today I actually understood something in my calculus discussion class! I probably will have trouble applying it to my homework problems though. Oh my gosh. I have a calculus midterm on FRIDAY! well next Friday. I have to do some major studying this weekend. This weekend my parents will be out of town. It will be the last time my parents can take a vacation for a year. My mom just got a new job! Yeah for my mom! She's been really therefore leaving my mom was out of a job. So we were living off of my dad's salary which isn't enough to pay all the bills. Thankfully my parents savings saved up but still taking a little every month will eventually end in 0. My mom looked for a job for almost 3 months before she just got hired last week. She doesn't have a college degree so that made it hard for her to find a job. That's why she wants me to get an education. She doesn't want me to. Sarah needs to shut up! She just walked into my room. OH MY GOSH she's singing the Fresh Prince of Bel Air Song! lol She just read what I wrote. OH MY GOSH now she's playing her mello. She's in the longhorn band. She's a big band nerd. I was once a band nerd. I played the sax! Wow I have like two minutes left! Well right now I'm feeling. Hungry! Obviously my thoughts are everywhere! Good-bye! ",0
1467,"This is going to be a cool assignment. We just get to talk about what is going on right now in our lives. I think college is going to be really awesome. We are going to learn so much from all the different types of classes we are taking. I am very tired from classes today. It is tiring to walk all around campus. I will not take the loop cause I don't want to be lost or anything. I think that would be scary to get lost on the loop. My roommate just left to the coop. She has to return all these books. My computer is pretty slow and I hope it doesn't break down while I am typing this. I think that Jester is pretty nice. I am glad that my suitemates are really cool. They take me places cause they have cars. One is from Katy, and my other suitemate is from Austin. My really good friend is sleeping, because she is waiting for me to eat. We are going to go eat at Jester probably. It should be interesting cause I really don't like to eat Jester food that much. It was alright at lunch, but I think it is going to be pretty gross tonight. People stare in the windows at Jester. It is weird to think that there are people out there that could be looking at you. It is really has a pretty courtyard though. I am so tired. I don't think I have much homework to do tonight though. It should be interesting, because I have to write a paper for English. I really don't know what I should write it about though. I have no idea. Gregory is a really cool place. You get to run and workout. I like to play volleyball. That has been lots of fun being able to play at night. UT has really cool places to see around it too. I think I have eaten out so much. People here are so different. I think that is really cool though cause if they weren't, this place would be really boring and stuff. The computer is sometimes a waste of time. I know so many people that just sit and chat on the computer for hours. I think it is really fun too, but you don't need to stay on it for a couple of days. People think that college is really easy and therefore don't have to study. I think they are going to get a rude awakening sometime. My suitemate is trying to work her computer. It is pretty funny cause she doesn't really know how to work it. My sisters just sent me a care package. It was really cool. It had like some soap, and candy. It also had like pictures and stuff. I have to move out soon cause of the pipes are being installed. Well, my friend says to write about the future. I don't know about the future. It should be pretty interesting I hope. I think that I will have to study a lot this year. My sister is going to try to help me out though hopefully. She is going to have it hard. I am going to play I'M sports. I hopefully will be able to handle everything cause I know it is really going to be hard and stuff. I eat too much. I am pretty full and all, and we are going to go eat soon. I only have a couple more minutes so I will talk about how my computer is not working. For some reason when I got home it was broken. My friend tried to fix it. I think it will be alright. My favorite tennis player won the US Open yesterday. It was pretty cool. He is really cool. He is from Russia. I am tired once again. I just want to finish this. I have taken Psychology before so I hopefully will be able to help my friends also that are in my class. All the people from where I am from all hang out with each other. It is pretty funny. I think that everyone should meet new people. My friends tried out for the MTV show. I don't know if they made it though. My time is up. I am very happy. ",1
1720,"As I sit here in front of my laptop, visions of the past 3 weeks of school flash through my mind. It has been a crazy, eventful, and stressful beginning to my college career. UT is the perfect place for me. The diversity of the students, the quality of the education, and the variety of extracurricular activities available are some of the many reasons that I chose to come here. Although I am completely content with my classes, my roomates, and my social life, today has been rough. Today, one year after 9/11/01, there have been strong feelings of sadness surrounding my thoughts. I cried this morning while watching the news, and again tonight at the ceremony at the tower. How will the families of the victims ever heal? My family experienced an unexpected death 2 years ago, and I know my Mom still cries at night. That sick, depressed feeling will forever haunt thouasands of people that were affected by the tradgedy on September 11. I cannot even contemplate their pain. I saw the different reactions of students tonight on the main lawn, and I know this tradegy affected people in different ways. Well, September 11 is a day that I will always remember and the families of the victims will always be in my prayers. However, in my religion, the one year anniversary of someone's death is observed and signified as a time for closure. It is my hope that on this one year anniversary, the United States will accept closure, but continue to express the pride and patriotism that we have been so boldly expressing throughout the year.

2225,"WELL, I FINALLY GOT TO MY WRITING FOR PSY. I HAVE BEEN AT HOME DURING THE LABOR DAY WEEKEND. I MISSED MY FAMILY SO MUCH ESPECIALLY MY DOG MENO. I REALLY DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE. I ACTUALLY WANT TO GO HOME RIGHT NOW. I HAVE TODAY OFF. MY CLASS IS NOT UNTIL 3:30 PM AND THE CLASS IS BIO 212.      MY BIO 212 PROFESSOR IS PRETTY FUNNY EVENTHOUGH I ONLY UNDERSTAND HIM HALF OF THE TIME. THE FUNNY THING IS HE LECTURES BETTER THAN MY BIO 211 PROFESSOR. MY BIO 211 PROFESSOR REALLY CANNOT LECTURE AT ALL. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING THAT COMES OUT OF HIS MOUTH. I REALLY DO NEED TO UNDERSTAND HIM OR ELSE MY EXAMS WILL BE EXTREMELY HORRIBLE. I HAVE A HUGE HEADACHE RIGHT NOW.      I'M WATCHING SOAPS RIGHT NOW. I'M WAITING TO WATCH ALL MY CHILDREN. RIGHT NOW I'M WATCHING PORT CHARLES WHICH BROKE OFF OF GENERAL HOSPITAL. RIGHT NOW ALISON IS LOCKED IN JAIL. EVERYONE THINKS SHE KILLED HER BEST FRIEND FATHER BUT IN REALITY SHE REALLY DIDN'T. ALISON IS A PERSON THAT IS SWEET AND INNOCENT AND CAN NEVER KILL ANYONE. THE PERSON THAT REALLY KILLED OR HURT ALISON'S BEST FRIEND LIVIE IS A WOMAN THAT DIED 300 YEARS AGO. SHE HAS BLACK MAGIC. SHE CAME OUT OF THE PICTURE. IT IS REALLY FUNNY. KNOW WONDER THIS SHOW WAS CUT OFF OF ABC. IT'S ABOUT MAGIC AND VAMPIRES.      WOW I CAN'T BELIEVER I HAVE ONLY BEEN WRITING FOR 9 MINUTES. 20 MINUTES FEEL SO FAR AWAY. I JUST SIGNED UP FOR THE PRESCREENING SURVEY. I WONDER HOW THAT WORKS.       YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T GONE SHOPPING IN A LONG TIME. I MISS IT. THE MALL DOWN HERE REALLY SMELLS AND IS PRETTY OLD BUT THEY HAVE ALL THE STORES I LIKE. LIKE BEBE, BEBE SPORT, WHITE HOUSE AND BLACK MARKET, NORDSTROM. I MISS MY GALLERIA IN DALLAS. I USUALLY GO SHOPPING ONCE A WEEK BUT NOW IT HAS BEEN A MONTH SINCE I HAVE GONE.       I CAN'T BELIEVE MY BROTHER IS STILL SLEEPING IT IS LIKE ALMOST 12 IN THE AFTERNOON.       SPEAKING OF MY BROTHER. HE AND HIS GIRLFRIEND AND MYSELF OF COURSE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT OUR FUTURE CAREER LAST NIGHT. I REALLY DON'T KNOW IF PHARMACY IS REALLY THE WAY I WANT TO GO. I LIKE IT JUST BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL THAT LONG AND IT MAKES GOOD MONEY, BUT I DON'T KOW IF I REALLY AM GOING TO ENJOY IT. I WISH I COULD FIND SOMETHING IN UT THAT WOULD POP OUT AT ME. I WANT A CAREER THAT WOULD MAKE ME HAPPY AND MAKE GOOD MONEY. I WISH I HAD A DREAM THAT WOULD TELL ME WHAT IT IS THAT I WOULD DO IN THE FUTURE. I WISH GOD WOULD COME INTO MY DREAM AND TELL ME THAT THIS IS THE PATH YOU ARE TAKING TO THE FUTURE. WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE TO KNOW. I REALLY WANT TO FIND THE RIGHT PATH TO MY FUTURE. I DON'T WANT TO WASTE HALF OF MY LIFE ON SOMETHING I WILL HATE IN THE FUTURE. HOPEFULLY SOMETHING WILL TRIGGER ME SOON.        I AM STILL WATCHING SOAPS IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES ALL MY CHILDREN WILL BE ON. WOW I ONLY HAVE ONE MINUTE LEFT TO WRITE. I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD SO MUCH TO SAY. IT REALLY MAKES ME FEEL BETTER JUST TO SAY EVERYTHING ON MY MIND. ",0
2292,"Today has been a terrible day here in San Antonio, because it is all ugly and humid outside. I am really glad that I came down this labor day weekend to see the family. My uncle is very mean he needs to be a bit more nice to me. He always makes fun of me ant telling me that I need to stay up in Austin and that I can't come down for the homecoming football game. I need to move to another room where the air conditioner is not so loud. I need time to think and be alone. My sister really needs to turn the volume on the TV down while I still do my homework. It is not fair that I am a very considerate person and then there are people who aren't towards me. Right now I am listening to my country music while I am typing. I find that country music soothes me and it very easy to understand. This always runs through my head: Why does this Hispanic girl listen to country? I feel that this is what runs through peoples minds, it runs through my sisters mind, she likes to listen to rap, R&B, and ""party music"",  and I never ask her why she likes that type of music. I don't mind that music either, but I prefer my country. Another thought that crosses my mind is: how come this girl doesn't listen to tejano music? I ask myself if I am adopted in the family, because it takes me awhile to get something's, I have this hyper personality, and I have an ""Irish persons'"" chin. I am smelling the fresh grapes that have just placed in front of my face. I have a bad habit of smelling things. I also have a bad habit of constantly washing my hands or using antibacterial hand sanitizer. I think that I am obsessive compulsive in something's. I always feel the need to be clean, and being organized. It is quite funny how as I get older I need to be clean, but when I was younger, I didn't care if I got dirty, or if I didn't take a bath; I hated taking baths. I am noticing that the time is running out on me and that I doesn't feel like it has been 20 minutes, it seems a lot faster. I thought that UT was going to be a SUPER SCARY school, but it isn't because I have awesome classes and the environment here is awesome, everyone here is friendly. I  ",1
2338,"It's a bit past 4 pm on a Sunday, and I only just woke up a while ago. So here I am, writing a psychology paper which has no definite topic as such. I usually listen to laid back electronic-type music when I do papers, which is what I'm doing now. I feel it helps me free up my mind, and help me think more clearly. I don't know how this paper is going to end up, or whether I'm writing what I'm supposed to, but I suppose that's the point of the exercise. So - tracking my thoughts. Well first off I just realized how annoying the timer at the top of the page is. Watching it tick away while thinking of something to write (which shouldn't be a problem anyway since I'm supposed to write what I'm thinking and not the other way around) just seems to get on my nerves a bit. I wonder what the rest of the writing assignments this semester will be like though. They need to fix this page up though, it didn't work in my primary web browser, Mozilla Firefox, and I don't like Internet Explorer all that much. Oh, the music just changed, it's a bit faster and slightly more aggressive now. I got myself some candy too, though I probably shouldn't have since I'll be having lunch in a bit. It's getting a bit warmer in here, someone probably increased the air conditioner temperature again. And now my roommate is playing basketball outside in the living room. One of these days I think he's going to break something. 10 minutes and the clock's ticking. I really should get some work done today. I pretty much wasted the last two days, but hey, what are three day weekends for? I've got some Math and CS homework, as well as a freshman seminar paper. Math's an interesting class even if it is too easy. Not to sound self deluded, but I do think I know more calculus than most people in that class, at least so far. Computer Science is a different story though. The class is a bit harder than I expected it to be, but nothing beyond me. A little googling and I should easily be able to look up anything I don't already know and complete the assignment. Java isn't really one of my strengths, but that doesn't mean I can't make it one. I like psychology though, at first I thought it would be impersonal and intimidating because of the sheer number of students in it but that's changed. 17 minutes. I just have to continuously keep looking at the timer. And the music just stepped up, now it's a bit faster than before. And I actually got this paper done! I'm so proud of myself!  well, not really, but I'm glad I got it done anyway. And now my mind's a blank really. Looks like my time's up. Did I mention I hate popups? Time to click the finish button.

1437,"Right now I'm listening to Travis. The band not the person. It can be really confusing talking about all the Travises that I know. There's the band, which happens to be from Ireland and is really awesome. Then there is Travis who goes to school here. There is Travis who goes to Trinity and who I dated at the beginning of the summer. I really liked him. It's too bad that didn't work out. Then there is Travis who goes to TCU and who I really like a whole lot. I've liked him for almost two years now. We just really connect and get along. It's crazy when you meet someone you just work with. I have met a few people like that, and I'm not just talking about boys, but all relationships. I always feel lucky when I know someone who is like me, who I can just hang out with and be boring with and just have so much fun. My mom and I are like that too. I miss her so much. She is my best friend. I know some people say that, and it just becomes another petty phrase, but when I say it, I mean it with all of my heart. She is the most awesome person I have ever met. I want to be just like her. That is my goal, my stretch, the place I know I can never reach, but my dream. She is my stars. I would be so happy even to be half as great as she is. She is a teacher, but not only in the sense that she works at a school and teaches her students French. It is one of her innate gifts. She is a teacher and a nurturer. When you let her be those two things, awesome things happen. Now that I let her be those things in my life, we have the most fulfilling relationship one could ever ask for. All I have to do is hear her voice and I am practically in tears. It's crazy how much I miss her. I've never missed anyone so much in my life. I just want to be with her all of the time. It's crazy how this is my mother and I feel so close to her. I'm not supposed to be in that place for at least a few more years. I guess I am just incredibly lucky. My family is the most important thing in my life. I figure it will take time until I get used to being away from them. I don't think anyone would ever peg me as the homesick type. I would have never pegged myself as the homesick type. I had no clue I would take it this hard. That's a surprise. I guess it's such a shock because two years ago first of all I was not so close to them, and I was a major stoic. No feeling. And now I am not afraid to admit that I love my family and miss them. I think that I am going to go home this weekend. I wasn't planning on it, but I don't want to stay away from them that much longer and there's no reason I have to since I do live in San Antonio. It's not like it's a terrible trip. My father makes it every day. I don't know if I'm going to though. I really don't want to ride home between two huge men in my dad's carpool again, and I don't have my car yet so I don't know. I'm still listening to my Travis CD and really enjoying. It's on the last song, which lasts almost 15 minutes and is like 4 songs in one. It is really great. Sometime I have to listen to the words though, because I really have no idea what it is about. Now I'm back to being excited about seeing the band. It's in less than two weeks, and Travis from TCU is coming down to see them with me. That is going to be so awesome. I really want to go home but the whole carpool thing really bugs me. Maybe I should call my dad and tell him that. Just tell him that I don't want to ride home with his carpool because that is a terrible experience. Maybe he would be able to work something out for me. Well, the CD stopped, and twenty minutes has elapsed, so those are my cues to stop writing. I'm going to go make my decision now. ",1
651,"IT's me. tying along, this is somewhat interesting, I''ll probaboly copy it onto my computer after I am done, after all, I am kind of interested in trackin gmy thoughts. When I talked with allison the other day, it helped to have I'm on instead of being on the phone. it allowed me to communicate and review what we had said to eachother. I really really really hope that we don't end up playing eachother this weekend, as I don't want to play her. I know I won't paly  ehr because myu lov efor her is true. and she won't paly me either, but exactly what will transpire I'm not too sure. how far is too far for the realtionsip we're in reight now? what is the relationship we're in right now? I trhink I want intimacy, but I'm not too sure. is it abuse of eachother if we don't miss eachother tremendously? IO miss her tons, but I can now ahve fun without her. I do need her, but it's less than it used to be. when she dumped me, it really hurt. I neve said that I dumped her, but I understand why she thought that. life's a dance - at least it's no longer a bitch. I wonder if I couldn't go to sleep last night because I was so excited about seeing her this weekend, or because I had just finished my exercises. How long does it take the body to calm down after exercising. I didn't sleep well, but I don't think it was due to her. I'm just stuck on what kind of intimacy should be shared this weekend. I do love her. I'm pretty convinced of that. After all, she is the most beautiful woman in the world to me. I know that my feelings for her have a lot to do with that. She has a great smile. I hope that she jumps on me when I show up. It would make me feel very special. IO'll definitely be excited to se her. Iknow she is looking forward to seeing me too. I kind of wonder whether it is better for me to be leaving on Sunday or Saturday. I don't really have much choice in the matter, but I could take a bus. I want her to come to UT. At UT the logistics would flow much smoother. I'm more than willing to dedicate my whole weekend to her. This would mean I would miss her more during the week, but it would be worth it. I have friends here, which really really helps. For example, last night I went up and worked on my spreadsheet and webpage while watching a movie with them. Of course, the movie was an 80s movie, and it just reminded me of her, but it was still fun. I do love her. I love love lovee love love love love love her. Love can be messy. It's okay for love to be disastorous - so long as you don't lose sight of the person you love. a lot of times I feel like I'm the only one that cares about us as a relationship. When I did that thing at Dave and Busters she was ready to break up. I didn't feel as if it was cause. I understand why she was mad, but I also kind of expected her to understand that I was frustrated. She says she loves me, but does she? She does things that indicate both ways. I don't think that I do things that indicate that I don't love her, but maybe I do. I wish she would tell me when I do/say things that hurt her. She really hurt me, when she said that it was better to be broken up right now. I want her to have fun. I used to be somewhat egotistical about it, but right now I just want us to fully enjoy eachothers company and miss each other enough so that it's not abuse of the relationship. Maybe nothing will happen this weekend. I hope that she spends time with me after the game. I expect her to spend time saturday morning studying, which is fine. I just know that I'm not going to have anything to do. I will bring my computer, but I will only be able to work on stuff that has no deadline. If it has a deadline, then it will have to be done Sunday night if it's not done over the weekend. That would stink. I come back, and I won't be able to see any of my friends because I have homework to do. I really do miss Allison. I'll probably do my PSY reading this week. The Republic is read enough for a while, but do I want to start getting ahead? Probably should. The problem with lowering our love relationship to a friendship thing is that then we will never see if our love is true. I don't want to make the worst mistake of my life, when I'm not sure of it. Allison is beautiful. Sure, she has some qualms about being outside in the heat, but otherwise she's ideal. Except, that I do wonder sometimes if she is in love with me. We should go do some outside type stuff. She has a set prenotion that she doesn't want to go camping, when in reality it could be quite fun. My parents don't do outside stuff together. Allison has swallowed the heat thing before - that says how much she loves me. It couldn't have been cold the second time at Miller Outdoor Theater. We've kissed in the heat before. The only thing is that a lot of my romantic ideas were for outside - the waterfall (not original), Galveston. romantic by its very nature means of nature - she wants someone to possibly sweep her off her feet, but I don't know if that's possible. I do love her. Well, it's actually time that this 20 minutes has past. It has passed quicker than I expected it too. ",0
118,"Well I was a little worried about using the Internet because I have never used before. I have used e-mail last year a little but for the most part this is a whole new experience to me. Today has been a good day I really enjoy my Monday and Wednesday class schedule. Except for the fact that I do have to get up at 7:30, but that is actually a good thing because my day is done at 10:00am and I have the rest of the day to do primarily whatever I want. I'm a little worried about the amount of stress that college has been. It is entirely not that bad because I do tend to be a organized person and good with managing my time. Although I do have to admit the reason why it has probably been so hard to get back on track this year is because my Senior year in high-school I got that little thing called ""senioritis"". I was hoping to be able to do this assignment from my computer in my dorm room, but the communications company has had a hard time getting my Ethernet Link set up. This is kind of nice though coming to the Undergraduate Library and getting acquainted with their systems. I have not decided what I am going to do this weekend, because it is one of my really good high-school friends birthday and she is going to school at A&M University. So therefore a lot of my friends are going to go down to College Station and surprise her. I really want to go but I want to stay here and go to the football game that is if I get a date. Which as of now I don't have one, but I am in a sorority here on campus and we have a mixer tonight with a fraternity so maybe I will get lucky and someone will ask me. Anyhow though these little events such as a mixer kind of make me uncomfortable because my boyfriend goes to school at Louisiana State University and it's strange trying to interact with other guys. Well I think I completely said that wrong it is not hard at all to interact with the opposite sex, but we decided mutually that we needed to try and date other people and not stay completely focused on someone who is 8 hours away. Anyhow this is really strange this assignment because I keep getting this urge to go back and re-word what I have just said. I do realize the point of the assignment and that is not what matters. I am really hoping that I have a great first semester at college. I am already enjoying it tremendously but I am a little nervous about the academics. My father will not allow me to bring my car up here until ""my grades have proven worthy"" as he says. I thought that was going to be a big deal but everywhere you go is within walking distance so it truly doesn't matter. Well I just glanced at my watch and it has been 23 minutes so I will be going back to my room now. ",0
1506,"Well. steam of conscience you say. Well as you will sonn learn by reading this I have a very random stream of conscience. I tend to jump from one thought to the next without warning. Now some may call that ADD but I personally think that it is due to my intellect. I have always gotten descent grades in school and when i apply myself i get all A's, i just lack that thing called motivation. But i think that i am starting to gain it once again becuase of the fact that i don't know what i want to do with my life so i have to have good grades in order to transfer into the school of my choice. I'm actually looking at the psychology department as well as business. Big surprise right?  I just looked up and saw a picture of my absolutely gorgeous girlfriend Lauren. Everything with her and i is great. other than the fact that she is still in hight school and living in houston. (by the way that is where i am from). She is great. We get along all the time and she actually has the ability to make me a better person, where as no one else that i have ever dated has had to ability to change me in the slightest way. I think that was because i never really cared about any of them even if i did say that i loved them. (you do what you have to do sometimes. . you know what i mean?)   Back home i was a member of the high school band. REally neardy sounding im sure but what can i say. Thats where i met lauren though and if you saw her you wouldnt be saying that. But anyway that is where some of my fondest memories have come from. I have continued with the whole band thing in collage. My brother was in it for four years before i got here and talked it up to be this great miracouls thing but now that i am in it i am kind of wondering what all the who ha was about. I mean i love the music end and the free games are nice but other than that i am kind of lacking interest. PLEASE IGNORE THE SPELLING ERRORS i am a horrible speller. I depend on the spell check. Well i just looked around my room at a poster of Brooke Burke that my roomate has on his wall. It makes me wonder if Lauren is the only person that i will ever have sex with and weather i am doing myself a bad thing by not getting out and experiencing things. I mean i have been with her the last 10 monthes. don't get me wrong  I LOVE HER and could never dream of hurting her, but i have to wonder what it would be like to be single in college. That alos makes me wonder weather i should feel guilty when i check out other girls as they walk by on the street or when i have   thougts   when watching a movie or things of that nature. Man Brooke Burke is hot.   I guess i am kind of feeling the   freshman symptons   that eveyone talks about. I miss being at home with my family. See i have never been to a church service or anything like that. I was raised on the principle of family. Which i love and that is what i know but i have to wonder weather or not im missing something by never have gone to a service. My family is jewish. Both my parents practiced when they were young and even when they were older, but once my mom's dad died (my grandfather) my mom stopped practicing because she did not understand why God would take such a good man a such a young age when there was a bitch of a mom (my grandmother) who deserved nothing that she had. So as you can see my mom has some issues with God and her mom. But this never being taught religion always leaves me with a void. I don't know weather i believe in a God or not. All i know is that i look at things logically and if there is not a logical reason for an action i have to wonder what is going on. Wow 17 mins. don't know if it really feels long or not but either way i have to fill 3 more mins.   Looking to the future i need to start looking for some gifts for Lauren because her birthday and our 1 year anniversary is coming up. Which is a big deal cause i never lasted more than 3 monthes with anyone else. Just another sign of how special lauren is to me. BUT more importantly my bday is coming up nad i hope to be getting a digtal camera so tha i can recorde the many addventures of collage.   Well times up so i guess i will be going.    ",1
281,"And so know I begin my first assignment in psychology. I don't know exactly how to begin this but I'm giving it my best shot. Typing isn't my forte so this is going pretty slowly. My roommate just walked in and then right out as soon as I told him what I was doing. Wow, there's something on the screen besides solitaire! He must be thinking. I hope my computer gets fixed soon. It'll be so much easier being able to send this through the internet from my dorm rather than going to the SMF lab and waiting for an open computer. They should have come to fix it by now. I guess they have a lot of people to help considering that I've called them two or three times already. And when the Ethernet starts working that will be awesome. Lightning fast access; no more waiting and waiting and waiting. . At least the phone lines are up and running ( in my room anyway). And not only that I got two free phone cards on the street today. I love it when they just hand out free stuff!  Uh oh, I just heard some cars screeching outside but I can't see anything from my window. I hope they're o. k. I can't leave this keyboard! Hmmmmm, I just got writer's block and I'm writing through my stream of consciousness. I wonder if that's bad. I just got a song in my head but it's not like I can write down the notes ( it's instrumental ). My gum is losing its taste, I think that I might need a new piece soon. It's Winterfresh gum. It's my favorite. I don't exactly know why it's my favorite gum, but maybe I'll find out in this psychology class. Psychology is a kind of hard word to type and it takes a little longer that some of the other words. My roommate just turned on some music. Its called Prodigy, the group that is, and they play electronic music. It sounds pretty cool, I think I'll go listen to it. ",0
1364,"I have done this twice now and erased it both times. I wish I could do it on a different program but my computer is broken and I don't exactly know how to use my neighbors that is letting me borrow hers. I've been thinking a lot about my family lately. I guess I'm finally realizing that I'm here for good. I'm used to going on long trips in the summer so I know what it's like to be away from home and my mom and dad but this is so different. It feels like it's a point with no return. Even if I live with them during the summer which is a possibility it won't ever be the same. The days of grade school at home are over. I really miss my mom. She is my best friend. Really though so is my dad and my brother Seth. It is amazing how close we are. I feel so fortunate. In my marriage and family class we talked about a healthy and strong family and I feel like my family met most all of the items on the list. We have so many memories together. I'm so lucky to have my brother. My brother's good friend died when they were in 10th grade. It was the hardest thing ever for our youth group at church. I miss my church so much. It is such a home to me. My best friends are from my church. It is so sad that I will never be in a youth group again as a youth. I ay end up going on trips as a sponsor or something but it will never be the same. I'm at somewhat of peace with the change but it still makes me sad when I realize the little things like not having to rush around on Sundays in order to be back for choir, supper, and bible study. The things that can drive you crazy are the things you miss. I miss my cat. He is so old. I remember when he was a tiny baby in 1988. He find us and adopted us. We named him Kitty Duke after Michael Dukakis' wife who we were voting for that year (it was Election time) but soon found that he was a he so we changed it to Duke. Everyone says that it sounds like a big dog's name but oh well. He is an orange tabby cat. It seems like he used to be fatter but maybe I've just gotten bigger. We've been through a lot. W e used to play together all the time. I'd sing to him when he was a baby. Without my brother I would be such a different person. He has helped form me in so many ways. He is my hero. I think the world of him. I didn't always though, like when he would hit me on the head or do ""gross"" things in my face as a normal big brother should do. But I'm very lucky to be so close to him. I try not to talk about him around Caitlyn, Jake's little sister. When he died she was in 4th grade. They were so close. I remember it all like it was yesterday. Getting the call at 6 the next morning. I had seen hi that Sunday night that he died at church and I remember him giving me that half smile that he did and me melting along with the rest of the girls in youth group. I talked to Catilyn about it for the first time this summer since it happened when she was in fourth grade. She broke down one night in Montana when we were on mission tour. We were all sharing what something meant to us and several people ended up relating it to their siblings. She just broke down which was a first. I talked to her and told her that I hated talking about Seth around her because Jake and him were the same age. She said that she loved hearing about Seth but she just wished that she had an older brother so badly. She said it like any other person who had never had a brother would say it. My brother is getting married this summer. It is so strange. I love Lauren. She is already just like my sister. They have been together for four years now. At first I was so jealous because I felt like she was taking my place as my brother's best friend. I soon realized that we had very different places in Seth's life and that there is room for both of us. I have Seth' past and we both have his future. My Family and I used to drive to our cabin in east Texas and have the best time. Seth and I would play so hard. On the way down we would always eat at the same fast food place and get burgers and icecream. Seth would always comment on the fresh air as soon as we got out of the car in the woods. It's funny what a family thinks is so humorous that would mean nothing to others. On the way down he would always try to explain the wonders of the earth to my mom and me like the stars and solar system and physics and things that Ginny and Anne Claire Hickman would probably never grasp. That's one thing I adore about my family. We all contribute different things. We are so different but so alike. I miss days of being with just us. We always traveled a lot. I think I'm just trying to let go of that time in my life right now. With me leaving for college and Seth getting married, it's a whole new chapter. We have the best traditions. Even food traditions like Chicken and Cheese soup on Christmas Eve and Asparagus on Easter. I hope to start traditions with my own family. I miss my room, my bed, my church, the familiarity of Ft. Worth roads, my boyfriend Blake and his house and my best friends from church. Blake would be a fantastic husband and father. I always say that if I don't marry him than I'll marry someone just like him. I wonder how my parents came up with our traditions. Like every Christmas Eve, Seth and I open one present, an ornament. Mine are always angels and his are always bears. Eventually we added my mom and dad with cats and Santa's. My mom doesn't even like cats. When she was little her dad expected her to like the animals and be near them so I think that's why she doesn't like them. They had a farm. She hated her dad. I can't imagine. When we drive to Oklahoma to see my grandmother, we always have very soul bearing conversations, some of our best in fact. She would always tell me about her childhood because I was so interested. Her dad was so difficult. In two weekends we're all going to Duncan, Ok. My uncle is coming in from Florida so we all are driving in. It will be great. I'm very close to my cousins and I really don't see them that often at all. At Thanksgiving when we were little we used to all cram into my Grandmother's house and each get one kernel of corn at our place which represented one thing we were thankful for. We each said it aloud before we ate. Another great tradition. ",1
2440,"     I hate escalators. Don't know why. I've always just hated them. Or maybe I'm afraid of them too. My right foot feels really numb. And not Comfortably Numb like that Pink Floyd song. Just numb. Pink Floyds OK, somewhere up there with Verve Pipe and Nirvana. There's this guy lousing back on the lobby across from me. He's wearing a fedora that's covering his eyes. He looks cool. Fedoras are cool. I wonder why guys stopped wearing them. I mean they look cool, especially in those old film-noir movies like The Big Sleep. I have no freakin' idea what that movie was about. The plot kept jumping like some kind of a grasshoper but it was OK. Some girls next to me are chattering/giggling. I hate it when people giggle that way. Its annoying. I hope I don't giggle that way then I'd be annoyed with myself. I wonder what it would be like to be somebody else. I mean what if I was the guy resting back on that couch? Would I be the same person in someonelse's body? Or someone different. I wonder if a different body makes you be different. I wish I had my CD player with me. Life sucks without it. Then again, it'll suck either way so I guess the CD player doesn't make much of a difference. I'm humming the tune to Something Stupid. Cute song. Though what the hell was up with Sinatra singing that with his daughter? Freak. But he's a cool freak. The weather here is always so damn sunny. I don't like sunny weather, it gives me a sun burn. I like it when the sky's all grayscale and it looks like its about to splatter down light rain. That's my kind of scenery. Always has been. Don't know why. I'm yawning now, even though I'm not all that tired. I wonder what the girl next to me is thinking. She looks like she's in really deep thought. Maybe she's thinking about lunch. No, lunch is over. Dinner. Yeah, maybe she's thinking about dinner. I can't wait until this week is over. What time is it? There's never a clock when I need one. Life's inconveniences. I'm looking at my wrist, at my nonexistant watch wondering what time is it. Hope I'm not late to class. Then again I was early to class the other day because I had my watch on upside down. My nails are too big, I need to cut them before I get a hangnail or something. My foots still numb, I wish the bloody thing would wake up since I've got a class to get to. I miss my friends back home. Hell I even miss my paranoid, stark-raving-lunatic of a mother. How pathedic. . I need a new pinky ring, this ones all rusty and broken down but I'm too attached to it. Its like one of those mothers that knows they have an ugly baby but love it anyway. Hey fedora-guy just woke up. Yeah, he's stretching his legs now. I wonder if my leg will ever move now. I wonder why people can't fly. I mean who wants cars and airplanes/jets when you can fly? That would be cool. I wish I could fly. But I wouldn't want wings, those would be too annoying to take care of. I also wish I could play the piano. But I guess desire never equals talent. Reminds me of Saliaree. Amadeus was a great movie. Great story. Fedora-dude is gone now, some other guy has taken his seat. He's not wearing a hat, but its OK. This guy's got long eye-lashes and a pointy nose. Pretty cool. I wonder if someday I'll wake up and everything was just one big nightmare. That would be great. I could start over. But knowing my luck, I'd just make the same mistakes. ",0

1567,"I've never really thought about what I'm thinking before, there seems to be someone in the net room making alot of racket. That's OK though because this is a dorm. They are talking now, wait I can't here them anymore, wait they just started talking again. I wonder what they are talkig about, probably something unimportant. I really need to find out where the Fine Arts library is so I can do this gay reading list. I don't even have a clear understanding of what I'm supposed to do. I assume I just have to look at some art and write down my feelings about it or something. It is really annoying becuase the class is already 4 hours long. There should not be any outside work, but I guess it's not too hard, and if there are not any set boundaries there isn't any set grading material, this means that it is basically completion, much like this assignment. I really want to go to the Texas Ski Ranch tommorrow but I can't find anyone to go and it is like an hour away and it will probably take longer because of traffic because the only time I could leave would be around 5:30. I hope they have put up some pimp sliders and kickers out there. If anyone reads this and you wakeboard/wakeskate and you want to go ride behind a pimp ass Supra Launch SSV and your willing to pay gas money contact me. Because I'm always looking for other riders and other people to pay gas money except myself. My roomate is sleeping right now. I can't decide if I like him or not. I don't dislike him, but I can't imagine myself being a really good friend of his. It seem our only link is that we are roomates. He seem like a little bit of a Jesus freak and a dork. That would suck if he was reading this right now, it's Ok, he's not. But you know how some people you just feel that you have a connection with them, that you can talk to them. You know that when your aroud them you feel comfortable. You can never tell that when you just look at a person. It seems to be the strangest people that are these people that you seem to share a special bond with, that you feel completly comfortable with. You feel you can be yourself, act stupid, laugh, you become a different person when you are around those people. I only noticed that fact this year. This year has been a real year of self examination and growth for me. I don't think I have grown as much as a thinking human being in this year then any other. I don't know what spurred it, but I think I know. I know I know. It was a girl I just got to know this year, but when I realized how important she was to me and how much I liked her she was taken. In my self pity I couldn't find the strength to tell her how I felt. I think I was scared of losing the friendship we already had. I didn't want our relationship to be strained by the possibility of me having feelings for her but the feelings not being mutual. I should have just told her and gotten it out in the open. She changed my life. I got the idea in my mind that to be with her I would need to be in the same physical shape as her to have any chance of a relatinship. She was the first motivation ever that pushed me to fulfill a long time goal of losing wieght and getting in shape. I still think about her and I know in my heart I will pursue her the next oppurtunity. The weight loss brings to mind another point that I have noticed about people. For as much talk that there is about inner beauty and all that shit, It's bullshit general (bulshi         ",0
2086,"Ok. I really don't know what I am supposed to be doing. I am just thinking. Hmmm. What am I thinking about. my stomach is growling. oh look its my jeremy camp cd I have not listened to that in a while. I wonder if carrie and I will drive to the concert in abilene on thurs. I don't want to make her go if she does not want to. hmmm. thirsty now. why is this water bottle green. that color is not so great to look at. interesting. thank goodness its friday. I miss home. college is not as easy as I thought it would be. its too quiet in this room. I can't stand it being so quiet. I want to get up and have someone to talk to but no one is here. What is up with my stomach. Its jumping around in knots. Goodness gracious. Mmm. M&ms look good in that cup over there. Ok. Five minutes have passed. it was not so bad. I have so much to do today. I have to get my cell phone fixed with some more minutes. I wonder if they will make me sign another contract. My mom might be right about that. I need to make a list. Right after I am done with this that is what I will do. Wonder when Carrie's class ends. I bet she is sleeping. Art history can't be that fun. My mouth is watering because of all of the hunger. What am I to do. Its all about willpower. The football game is too early tomorrow. I need to figure out if I need to move my car out to the garage. Why don't the stupid people keep me informed. Its crazy, I pay 650 for a parking space but you have to move it on game days. Craziness. Its cold in here. I need a jacket. O, the blanket will work. Wonder what texture this thing is made out of.

I can't look at these pictures on my board. They just make me sad and reminded of home. I hope Britt is doing alright. I wondered why little Josh imed me. I bet he is asking me a question about a girl. Hehe. He is such a cute little boy. Hopefully he is doing alright too. Ok now I am bored. Why is that highlighter on the floor. Is it mine or Carrie's.

I think it must be infected. Wow. That was a slow minute. Need to talk to mom about some money and paying Carrie back. I need to find that paper that says the stuff. so much to do.

366,"Tonight I get to go to a date dash function with my new sorority. Some of my friends set me up with a guy that I have never met before. I can't wait to meet him. I hope he is nice and at the same time, good looking!  This week has been good. All my classes are going well, so I feel confident about them and life in general. Lunch today was especially good, since I haven't eaten a real meal in a few days. I love college. It's so good to not have to worry about a curfew and letting my parents know exactly where I am going to be, etc. I love my roommate, and we have almost the same schedule, so that works out perfectly. Last night, I typed an extrememly long letter to a friend that I hadn't talked to in a few weeks, so my fingers are still kind of tired from typing then. That's ok, though, because I am getting some homework done early, so that I don't have to worry about it later on. That is definitely a good feeling. I am also feeling excited because I saw two guys on campus this morning that I know from high school. Ever since the first day of classes, I had been wanted to see someone I knew. It just happens that those two that I saw today were also some of the cutest and most popular guys that I know. Lucky me!  This gum that I'm chewing is from a blow pop that I finished a few minutes ago, and it is already losing its flavor. Those things never last long at all. I have a problem with one of my classes. see, I swam all throughout junior high and highs school, and I want to continue in college, but every time I want to do something, the class is in the way. I've already changed the time once, but it still causes conflicts. That is very stressful. I don't know if I should change it to an early time because then, I would have to take a shower in between classes, and it might be a pain. But then at least I'd have time to go to my sorority meetings and all the fun parties and stuff. But would I have time to take my regular naps in between my classes like I usually do?  No, I don't think I would. Let's see. which is more important?  I guess more things will come up in the evenings than in the mornings, so it might be better to change to that early time. I just don't know. WOw, I have like nine minutes left. THis isn't such a bad assignment. Psychology is actually really fun. I've only been to two classes, but the professor is really funny and definitely keeps my attention, which is hard to do for an hour and a half. I hope the tests aren't too hard, though, because I'm not that great at analyzing and stuff. I took psychology in high school, and it was way different. My teacher bored us to death, and we learned practically nothing. It was the easiest class ever!  I am going home to Houston this weekend, which is very exciting because all my friends from different colleges are coming home, too. We are all going to go see Clay Walker, my favorite country singer. My ex-boyfriend will also be in town. I haven't seen him in over two months. He goes to West Point in New York and had to leave in late June. I talk to him every once in awhile, but I miss him so much. We are still great friends, and I can't wait to see him again. We dated for a year and three months, so its strange not to see him at all anymore. This gum is really ready to be thrown away, but I'll wait for my four more minutes to do so. I have one more class today, and that is a study hall calculus. Those are never stressful, since the T. A. just helps us with some problems like our homework. He's a nice guy. The first time all we did was say our names and stuff like that, but I'm sure we'll actually accomplish something today. At least I hope so. Getting to know people is good, but I really needed some help with a couple of those problems!  Well, I guess it has been twenty minutes, so I better go. Hope anyone who reads this is having a great time!  :) ",1
1844,"Right now I'm feeling a little stressed out and worn thin. I'm a real estate agent and a full time student as well. I've been to Round Rock this morning again for the second day in a row for a 9:30 appointment. I just can't seem to get everything done that needs to be done. I've got a ton of laundry to wash, my cell phone is ringing AGAIN, and tons of reading and studying to still do this week. I'm a little down because I had two deals at work fall through yesterday. I had to deal with another agent that was the most ignorant and unprofessional one I've had to deal with yet. His clients backed out of a deal on my listing and as a result I'm not closing on my client's new home. It's not a good time to be a real estate agent in Austin right now, but I'm trying my best and I guess that's all I can do. I'm not a traditional student and I feel a little out of the crowd in my classes. I've been working full time since I graduated over six years ago and going to school at night. I finally got to a point where I couldn't take any more night classes and here I am trying to finish up during the day. I've learned a lot and I value my experiences over the years. Sometimes I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel. It seems crazy I'm doing all this at once sometime, but bills have to be paid, I have to eat, and the cycle goes on. I do work hard, but I've almost forgotten how to relax and take it easy. I don't have time to watch TV and do a lot of things I really enjoy. I guess I'm more frustrated at the fact that there aren't more hours in the day than I am at myself for not accomplishing more. This is an odd assignment to do. I've never heard of something like this before. I am enjoying my classes even if I do feel like the outsider in most of them. I like to learn new things and have challenges I know I can get through and do well with. There are some nice people I've met at school, but most people I've noticed don't talk a lot and don't make eye contact when you pass by them. I haven't figured out why this is yet, but I'm curious. I'm friendly and smile and talk to people. It's strange they don't always respond. I was just brought up differently I guess. I'm not feeling really great right now. It's probably from stress, but I'm hoping it's just something in the air that will go away soon. I can't afford to be sick. It just won't work right now. My nose is all stuffed up and my throught is itchy, so I've been popping vitamin C's like they're going out of style. Let's see. . what else am I feeling? Well, I'm in love and very happy with my relationship. I came here to Austin a year ago because of him. We have a good relationship and get along great most of the time. Moving in together and moving to a new city was a challenge though. I was the most pathetic, depressed little thing when I first came here but I've moved out of that phase and am much happier now. I don't deal well with extreme changes. I set schedules for myself, but I don't always stick to them because I try to fit too much in. I've been late to everything it seems lately and I need to work on that. I don't like being late because it's rude and embarrassing. I don't have a lot of friends, but the few I have are very good friends. My sister just moved here this summer and I feel like a part of me that was missing before is back again. We grew up a year apart and were like twins growing up. We can do that thing where you talk without saying a word a lot of times. It kind of freaks people out, but it's fun. My cell phone is ringing again. I'm thinking about all the work stuff that I need to get done today. I haven't had time to get to my office yet and I've got at least six people to call back here when I'm done. I'm going to have a lot of weight lifted from my shoulders as soon as my deal closes on the 24th. I need the money for sure. That's my other stress, but it's getting better. Overall, I think I worry about things too much. I've always had enough to get by through good times and bad. Somehow I always make it through. I guess I'm stronger than I look. I'll be back to work in a minute. Maybe I can learn to balance my schedule better over the next few weeks. It'll be easier someday I'm sure. This has been interesting. I feel like I've been rambling for 20 minutes. Well, I'm back to work again.          ",1
555,"that's  a typical girl response I guess I still have about fifteen minutes left I tried right before this to take the pretest again. the first time I only got as far as the 27th question and it wouldn't let me continue now it says the line is busy or something like that I don't mind volunteering for experiments and I understand that experimenting is essential for the psychology students but I think that it is wrong for the department to force us to do this or they will block our grade and I have already been to mezes twice to try to sign up and there was no space left and the only space left was for males only so it's just a little frustrating I'm trying to think I don't type very well because it has been so long since I had to type anything I can't remember when I wrote an essay last my high school was a joke we only had 4 classes at a time for an hour and a half per class every day and we had finals four times a year although I usually exempted them you don't know how glad I am to be out of high school I really didn't like it there too much that might have something to do with the fact that we had 4500 students on one campus I really enjoy attending ut although I don't have a major yet everyone says that's okay but I would really like to get onto taking courses that specifically interest me I'm thinking about majoring in government with a minor in german but I might go into political science it's whatever I've so many ideas of what ""I want to be when I grow up"" that even includes psychology like everybody and their mom wants to do. I have about five minutes left I'm still hungry and after this I'm going to try to take the pretest again. yesterday I moved from the 12th floor of jester west to the 9th floor my roommate never showed up and this girl Nissa's roommate also never showed up so I moved into her room she's really nice and this is so weird: we are so alike she even has my birthday she lives in Missouri city which is right outside Houston where I live pretty nifty huh so we're going to go shopping and decorate our room some more it's going to look really cool I'm still hungry and I really don't want to eat that nasty jester food but I might as well because I already paid for it well not really the bill comes later this month anyway my 20 minutes is up and I'll be back here tomorrow to do assignment number two ",1
1260,"What's on my mind? Right now I am in my friends room, one who I met this year. Her names is Si Nae Kim. The thoughts on my mind as I type are, ""mmm. this chocolate is so tasty"". I love chocolate and I choose to eat it as much as I want to until I come to the realization of how fat I am and how much fatter I am going to get if I continue to eat chocolate the way that I do. There's this thing that my friends and I call a train thought and this is when one thought leads to another. The thought about chocolate making me fat leads me to think about my eating habits in college. My mother warned me not to eat unhealthy foods, not to eat late at night, and not to snack during the day. That statement replays in my mind over and over again, every time I pick up something to eat. Yikes! Well, now I'm just thinking about how I can lose all this weight. Should I go work out, jog, do aerobics, or should I just read my books. I am just so lazy that I can't ever seem to go workout. On Tuesdays and Thursdays I only have one class from 3:30 to 5pm. I spend the rest of the day either sleeping or attempting to do my homework. These activities don't take up my entire day and I do have time to workout. However, I am just too lazy. Now the thought of how tired I am has just hit me. All day I have been reading, trying to catch up on my assignments that I have fallen behind on. My eyes are puffy and I can feel them starting to close on me. My body is giving out on me too. Trying to right this paper, which I almost forgot about, is taking a lot of energy from me at this point. It's interesting to see exactly what's coming out of my mind so freely. I can't wait to read this after I'm completely done. Hmm. I wonder if this paper is actually going to be graded in any academic point of view. I wonder how hard the test is going to be. I wonder if I really have to read all the chapters or if I can just rely on Mr. Pennebaker's lectures. I hope I don't fail psychology class. I hope that I pass with an A. Wow, I feel like I'm just babbling now. Will this paper get too long? My mind seems so boring up there. The things that are coming out on paper right now are so boring and useless, but this is what I was told to do. I'm trying really hard to type without stopping but it's hard. Well, I have about five minutes left. What else is on my mind? Should I go to my biology discussion class tomorrow? We didn't really do much the last time and it isn't mandatory. Oh well. I wonder how my family is doing in Houston. I wonder if my sister misses me. Actually, I know that she misses me because she told me so. I wonder if I'm going to meet any one cute anytime soon. I wish I had a boyfriend, but then again, it is kind of fun being single. Then I don't have to worry about being held down. This is college, a whole new world of opportunities to meet new people, to discover myself. Wow, I'm so overwhelmed at the thought. I don't know if I am completely used to the whole college idea yet. Oh my goodness, I met my exboyfriend today. What a small world. I thought that I would never see him again. Oh, you probably don't want to hear about that stuff though. I wonder how my best friends are doing back at home. I miss them a lot. I feel like I left everything behind. I feel like I'm away at camp or a long retreat. I feel like that life almost never existed, that the whole thing was just a fantasy. I feel like I've been living here, in Austin, for a really long time. Wow, my thoughts are really random and still boring. What a boring life I lead. argh! I kind of want to go partying, but I'm afraid that I'll get addicted and then I'll eventually fail out of college. What a bright future. yeah right! I love dancing, I really regret not taking it in high school, but hopefully I won't make that same mistake again in college. College, where the doors open up to new adventures. This is the real deal, this is pretty much when everything counts. It's going to lead me to my future. Well, my time is up now so ta ta! ",0
700,"Okay, I think this is going to be hard for me to do because honestly I'm not sure if someone will be reading this and if they will think that what I say is stupid or I am doing it wrong but perhaps that is a stupid thing to say also since I just clearly read that there is no right or wrong thing to say. so basically I have just entered this new sort of world. I am now what I would call a real person. that is, I am no longer totally dependent on a parental figure or figures as it were. this is like a whole new life for me. right now I suppose I am lonely, living by myself and so from this statement stems the thought that has haunted me for days: should I be living in a dorm instead of my own apartment and I could go on and on thinking this but I will always come to the same conclusion. And that is that either way there are advantages and disadvantages, and besides that there is no reason to play the what if game because I already live in an apartment and there is no way that I could even get into a dorm at this point. But I know that that is my nature. That is, to think about things that I can't change. I always wonder well, if I had done it that way then this would have happened or wouldnt have happened. I hate that I do that. there really is no point. I can't change the past so I don't really understand why I waste the present regretting past decisions or thinking about what could have been if only. of course, I have tons of regrets in my life. maybe I just I don't know. I honestly don't know why I can't just be happy with the decisions I make for myself. it all goes back to my stupid nature of always envying other people. I tend to look at what they have and think that I could be like that if only I. it could be any thing. I just hate always being envious of others and thinking that they are better than me because. the list could go on and on. Really I don't know why I am not satisfied with the way I am. I mean I know that I don't have self esteem problems but still I am always thinking that I need some sort of improvement. I really should be happy with myself. I have done a lot of good things for myself and I have a lot going for me unlike others for example tracy walker. but still I can take a person like that and still find things in her that I envy. I must say that is pretty pathetic of me. w wish I knw why I even cared about tracy or the whole lake dallas crew. I mean, I spent my whole life with these people playing the little game that everyone played the lake dallas way all up until my last year when I realized how unbelievably stupid it all was. its weird how my junior and senior year my outlook on life totally changed from the way that I saw things my freshman and sophomore year. now there is a time that I wish I could go back to. I hadnt made any stupid mistakes yet. I didnt have any enemies I had tons of friends I was secure with myself and for christ sake I wore a freaking size 6. lord, life was good back then and I really just wish that I could go back to it sometimes. I am beginning to wonder if life will ever be as great as it was then. I know that sounds pathetic but I still have to wonder. everyone days college is so great but I just hope that the social aspect will pick up soon. I feel as if I am behind or maybe I just don't know how to have fun like I used to. I think that I just need to find friends that I am truly comfortable with and a boyfriend wouldnt be bad either.

1247,"Trying to decide what to eat for dinner is complicated, especially when people don't answer the question. When you ask someone ""What do you want to eat?"" most likely they will say, ""I don't know what do you want?"" Well, if I did know what I wanted to eat, I wouldn't have asked you. It is a simple question with a simple answer. Right now I just asked my boyfriend what he wanted for dinner and his response was, ""I don't know whatever you want"". Well, that's why I asked you, I don't know what I want to eat, that's why I asked you. I guess that I wanted him to make the decision for me. I honestly don't know what I want to eat. It's a simple question and it's up to my stomach and brain to make that decision, but I'm asking someone to make this important decision for me. Does this mean that I'm lazy because I want someone else to make a decision that I can only make for myself. Maybe I'm not lazy; maybe it's just I want someone to help me make that decision. That seems logical, a person can't be lazy simply because he or she doesn't want to make a decision for themselves. ",1
203,"My thoughts, sensations, and emotions are always changing with each new experience, idea, and whatever happens throughout my life. They are affected sometimes by what other people think and sometimes affected from just maturing and thinking differently. Right now I feel like I am in control of myself because I am doing well in school academically, socially, and mentally. School work is very important to me and I make sure that I do well. I don't go overboard like a lot of my friends who study hours every day. Socially, I have adapted very well in meeting new friends. Mentally, I am in control and focused on what is going on in my life. There were some problems that have caused some stress in my life since college started. First, me and my roommate got in some petty arguments, but now we are getting along just fine. Also, I had some guy problems. I regretted doing some things I knew I shouldn't have done, but now we worked things out and or friendship is even better than before. I know that I haven't been eating right and sleeping enough, which is causing some changes in my body that cause me to be more tired and weak. I always go to sleep way too late and wake up early for my classes. Last night a friend called at two in the morning and I talked to him for hours even though I should have y eight-o-clock class. I am in a very good mood today because everything seems to be working out for me. I'm usually a nice pleasant person until I am faced with a lot of stress or go through PMS. Then I get in a really bad mood. My friends know when to stay away from me. The only thing really troubling me right now is all the reading I have to do for my classes. the assignments they give us are no problem, but the reading is crazy. They bombard us with reading assignments that  really aren't necessary. My art class, for instance, requires for the present moment for me to read from pages 13 to 200-something. I really don't want to read about all these statues and paintings and sculptures from different eras. Anyway, I miss my family, but I'm not homesick at all. How can I be when my parents call ALL the time?  I know they care for me, but it's really not necessary for them to want to visit every weekend, which I won't allow them to do. That sounds mean, but they're going to have to get used to it. I do miss the free laundry and the home-cooked meals and my own room and my nice bathroom, but oh well.                     ",0
1637,"     let's see. i love him? maybe. he told me he loved me, well, that he liked falling in love with me. wow. this is new. i love being held by him. i miss him when i'm not with him. i think about him when we're not together. i don't know what to tell him. nothing needs to be said though. we like each other. love may come, develop, whatever. it's a good feeling to know that you are loved, not having family and old friends nearby. he makes me feel like i am at home. now that i do have a new home, up in oklahoma. speaking of which, he said he wanted to come with me when i go up. wonder what the parents will say??? oh well, nich likes him and i know they will too. he's hard not to like. so busy, not enough time. should i stay home this weekend to spend more time with him or is that trying too hard? what's trying to hard though, if my feelings are this strong then it shouldn't matter whether or not i try to be with him. obviously he has the same feelings, he only called me every day like five times in the past couple days since he has been busy with his fraternity business. ahh, the good old fraternities. i wish i would have rushed, but then again i am glad i didn't. there is always next year. wonder if it is more difficult to get in as a sophomore?? we shall see. i mean, i don't think greek life is that important. but aparently to some it is. i guess i need to make more friends that are girls. i really do want to become more involved as well. it's just the whole rushing process that i wouldn't like. the getting all dressed up and basically trying to impress some girls. not to mention the fact it seems like competition. one of my not-so-favorite things. i don't really understand it all. i just couldn't be fake like i know some girls are. why bother? i mean, be who you are if they don't like that, then what on earth are you doing? there's no reason for them not to like me. i can't decide whether it's an acceptance thing or not. i don't think i am scared of being rejected. sure in a sense i am. but i think i would take it better if others didn't have to know. i like the perks with a sorority, they seem fun. a lot of time commitment though. i guess i just think that i would see him more often if i were in a sorority, if not that, then i would be just as busy as he is. i mean, i have lots to do now, probably should be doing even more. but still. it's different. poor erik, i wonder if he is still bitter towards his parents about not letting him pledge. it suprised me when my mom said they would pay for it. does she realize the cost? i know she really wants me to get involved as well though. well, i guess i can just ask casey and lauren and other girls how it is. that is if they can say. blah blah blah. nothing on my mind. oh i wonder if lk got the tickets to the live concert. i want to go. but it's such a hassle to drive to katy and back. plus i would probably miss a few classes. let's see, that friday is my homecoming. haha. won't that be great. very unusual for sure, but it will be fun to see everyone. i wonder if they have changed. i know i have. i mean, i haven't seen these people since may. coming here over the summer was one of the most life-changing experiences. strange enough to say, it is very true. i met so many good friends. i met my baby, who. i love. . yeah about that. we've been   together   for sometime now and he is seeming to settle more or less. which i might add, i thought could never happen. ok, but hold on, we're like 18, no settling allowed. yeah he asked if i would marry him. that was funny, jokingly, luckily. haha. no, funny thought to think about though. marriage. ahh. i really can't wait, no can wait, but i look forward (much better wording) to having a family. i want a happy family and a loving father/ husband. wow, i wonder what guys think about this stuff. i never used to even care about family and husband and future stuff. but since he came along and we've been together. it just makes ya think. good thoughts, nothing too serious. man i love him though. i hope he knows.

283,"Well it's hard to pinpoint my first thought as I begin to write, as it would be hard to pinpoint one thought that I have at any one time. I think constantly, usually about things that I should or shouldn't be doing at that time. For example, I constantly think about things I should be doing to help myself apply for medical school, like joining organizations, volunteering at hospitals, or studying to have that 3. 6 or higher. It seems like I'm always on the go now. This summer was pretty leisurely and then I move down here and I try to work the same hours taking 12 hours instead of 3. It's not the best thing for the soul. Speaking of soul, I try to go to church when I can and I feel guilty when I don't, but I haven't found the chance to go yet. And I hate making excuses, but I do a lot. I just watched a TV show on MTV called Austin City or something like that. It really excited me because I'm from a really small town, which  I don't think ever makes the news. I have been really impressed with UT and Austin so far. All my professors have been great and I can learn from their lectures. I went to North Texas for two years, where I had to learn most things on my own. I transferred with Express and it is a lot harder down here. The manager is a lot stricter; I can't lean!  I'm going to cut my hair off this Friday, but I don't know if I should. But, on the other hand, my hair causes me to get really hot and sweaty. I have already made the appointment, so I guess I will go through with it. I can't imagine how boring this must be for yÃ¯Â¿Â½all to read,  but I guess it could get pretty interesting depending on the students  I guess you can tell how confused I am all the time. It shows in my writing how often my thoughts conflict one right after the other. Writing this hasn't taught me that though, I already knew I was confused. ",0
575,"I wonder if he is thinking of me????  I am glad I am finally getting this done cause there is no need for procrastination now. I need to do all this as soon as I get it. I had done this before but I could not submit it. I have something special with Alex and I know how he feels and he is different. he isn't like all other guys he is innocent and pure and he would not hurt me. I hope not to hurt him. I need him and need someone like that. someone to take care of me and to be there for me if I need to  talk someone to talk to me and someone that I can take care of and love too. he is perfect in my eyes and although he might not know that he is he is wonderful. he will never know I guess. he is there for me when I most needed him. he has held me when I cried and has made me laugh when I was sad/  I owe a lot to him. we have spent a lot of time together and it has been really fun. I wonder if he knows how much fun I have had with him. I don't think he understands. I am going through a hard time and I am going through a big transition, but I think I am doing fairly well. I have not cried much. my roommate went home this weekend and I felt kind of lonely cause we are used to going places together and it felt weird to  come home and be alone and not have someone to talk to or even argue with. we had gotten into an argument before this weekend and the time that we were apart really helped us understand each other. we are okay now. my exboyfriend has given me a hard time too. I don't want to be with him anymore, yet he still persists. he know that I am dating Alex and that it is over between us yet he still calls and he still asks questions like where were you and who were you with. I want to get away from that I am tired of having to answer questions about my own life. I want to be free and to be able to do what I want and that I think is right not what other people think I should do. it isn't fair to me  if I have to make someone else happy before I could do things for my own freedom. it important to be free because without freedom a person is not happy or simply can't be an individual. there are many things to do here in Austin and many many people to meet and make friends with. I have had a good time so far and I have enjoyed going to class and learning. although I do think that I should read a little more. I will be fine though. Claudia and Alex will be there if I need anything. ",1
1264,"I feel strange because I'm in a world of completely new things. I tell myself that is all the same from any other people or situation, and it is in a way because if I always look at myself from an aerial view I will only see myself as one of the others, that we are all masses of tissue. But this is difficult because I know that I am myself, in a sense, and that really, everything will happen to me and the only way I can interpret the stimuli is by the way it comes to me, pertains to me. I don't want to be selfish, in the other respect of that word, but by thinking about myself I know that I therefore am selfish. I was depressed for a few days because I did not want to let go of another person. It was so much bullshit that I just finally sat on the roof and sorted everything out, looking at the stars. I came to the conclusion that I didn't need that right now, and that I was only cheating myself by believing this. It is strange because I have such problems with that. I realized recently that I have not reached the belonging. stage of life. Or maybe I reached it by not even trying, when I was very small, but I think ever since school started in kindergarten, as far as I can remember school wise, so maybe I have recessed back under that level of substantial importance. I'm having trouble being myself because I know that I don't even know myself. I do in a sense, but I sometimes think that it is just what I want to tell myself I'm like, and that I try to make myself the person that I think other people will like to see. Then I think that has everything to do with the belonging. factor. I am ultimately working towards self actualization. But I'm trying to be realistic in thinking that it won't be until I'm older like in my thirties. But it doesn't have to be that way. I don't want to feel like I can't do something, but I think how young I am and I think that I'm still just a little kid, and that I will have to work on this a lot more. I don't want to accept myself so I don't let others accept me. Its so hard, and winding. but now I know what I have to do, I have to find what it is that will make me chill out and respect myself and others. This is the key to passing the belonging stage of the cycle towards self actualization. I just need to stop worrying about shit like this and just be happy. And now I know what I have to do. ",0
1477,"I just completed the pretesting survey. Sigh, things like that make absolutely no sense to me. I can never decide exactly where I stand, and I can never define myself with the choices provided. Always have to compromise who I am. I always end up generalizing all of those qualities I have fought tooth and nail to keep. Starting college has been such a weird experience. A room full of people, but I am still alone, a street full of people, but I am on my own, a world full of people, I have nobody but myself. I am glad the ball has started to roll. College is beginning, and, so far, there have been no horrid surprises, I have not been ambushed by a detail I have overlooked. I now have to gauge the speed of that ball, and plan my life around it. I need to visit my family this weekend. That is a drag, I am just beginning to form this new life, just starting to assemble my new identity, and I have to disassemble everything, and hide it in the closet. Family, sigh, the wonderful thing about family is you are sentenced to being around people who you probably will never get along with. Parents are even funnier. You are sentenced to respect and obey these people you probably will never get along with. I bet you are assuming I don't get along with my family, that we fight all the time. Right and wrong. I don't get along with my family, the key word is I. The person they think I am gets along with them perfectly. We haven't fought in 2 years, that was the last time I tried to be myself around them. Then I realized that I had to either bullshit them and survive, or go down in history. So here I am, Mr. Bullshit. Sigh. Sometimes I wonder where the bullshit ends and I begin. I stopped wondering about that a while ago. It was too hard to tell. I hate every person who is in my life right now. My roommates are ok, but immature. My girlfriend, that's right, girlfriends, are not compatible with me, but I am not willing to give up having sex, to be perfectly honest with them. At least not until I can find somebody I get along with, and can have sex with. I don't know why I place so much importance in sex, but that is all I can think of when I see a slightly attractive woman. I feel so evil sometimes, but I am sure my parents would be proud. I might be a depraved heathen, but at least they taught me how to bury myself under selfguilt. Good for them. This is the end of the twenty minutes; I need to go get my laundry out of the dryer now. Until next time. Ciao. ",0
275,"I feel kind of strange doing this assignment like this -- I don't think I've ever had such an informal assignment. I just got off the phone with this girl that I met in Galveston when I was a junior in high school -- the whole time I was talking I was also thinking about how I wanted her to shut up so I could do this assignment. Well, anyway, here I am sitting before this CRT not really concentrating or doing anything special -- just king of chilling. My roommate is playing Quake on his computer on the other side of the room -- also the radio is on and so it makes it king of hard to concentrate with all the noise in the room. I think the artist on the radio is Natalie Merchant -- damn I really hate her music -- it's so poppy it's disgusting. everything the drums to guitars to vocals sounds so devoid of feeling or meaning -- it's a mind numbing, spirit-crushing experience listening to this crap . I just wish she would shut up . I prefer bands like Korn or Pantera. they sing with so much feeling, and all the songs are sung with vehemence and anger and lust and disgust and hatred. the entire spectrum of emotions is explored in their works. other favorite bands of mine are helmet, Alice in chains, pearl jam,etc. I guess I kind of got caught up in the whole alternative revolution phenomenon. I WORE FLANNEL AND HAD RIPPED UP JEANS AND DOC MARTENS AND I EVEN DID THE DRUGS THAT WENT ALONG WITH THE WHOLE ALTERNATIVE SCENE. A BIG MISTAKE IN MY OPINION BECAUSE THOSE VICES WITH WHICH I EXPERIMENTED LAST THEIR TABOO AND SO NOW I HAVE NO FEAR OF THEM AND WOULD HAVE NO QUALMS ABOUT TAKING THEM OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT THEY DESTROY YOUR BODY AND MIND. NOW I ONLY DRINK -- ANOTHER RESULT OF MY EXPERIMENTS WITH ""ALTERNATIVES"". IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE IN HIGH SCHOOL I WAS A DRUGGER AND AN ""ALTERNA-TEEN"" WHEN I WAS WISHING THAT I COULD BE A MUSICIAN. BUT NOW THAT I AM ONE -- I HAVE MY OWN BAND -- I DON'T REALLY FEEL THE NEED TO DO LIVE THE ALTERNATIVE LIFESTYLE. I DON'T DRESS STRANGE OR HAVE STRANGE HABITS. I HAVE A 4. 0 GPA AND WAS THE VALEDICTORIAN OF MY HIGH SCHOOL, SO THAT KIND OF BELIES SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE SAID HERE. bETTER MAN BY PEARL JAM JUST CAME ON THE RADIO. I LIKE THIS SONG ALOT. PEARL JAM'S NOT AS GOOD AS THEY USED TO BE. THEIR ALBUMS TEN,VERSUS AND VITALOGY ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THE ALBUM NO CODE IN MY OPINION. NO CODE SEEMS SO STERILE AND NOT PEARL JAM. I THINK IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT DRUMMER--THE OLD DRUMMER FROM THE RED HOT CHILE PEPPERS. HE SUCKS IN COMPARISON TO DAVE ABBRUZZESE--THE OLD DRUMMER FOR PEARL JAM. I WISH THEY WOULD PUT OUT ANOTHER AWESOME ALBUM. IF THEY DID I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY. OH YEAH, MY ROOMMATE JUST REMINDED ME ABOUT THIS GIRL THAT I KNOW. SHE'S A FAT GIRL AND SHE'S KIND OF A BITCH. SHE KEEPS CALLING ME AND CALLING ME, BUT I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO HER BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE HER 'THAT' WAY AT ALL--BUT SHE LIKES ME LIKE THAT. . . . I KIND OF LIKE LIVING IN JESTER BECAUSE IT IS VERY CLOSE TO EVERYTHING THAT GOES ON CAMPUS. THE FOOD SUCKS REALLY BADLY, BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF BEAUTIFUL GIRLS THAT LIVE HERE---SO THAT IS REALLY COOL. I JUST GLANCED AT MY WATCH BECAUSE I AM TIMING MY TIME HERE ON THIS ASSIGNMENT. I ONLY HAVE A FEW MORE MINUTES TO DO THIS ASSIGNMENT. I JUST THOUGHT ABOUT HOW DELICIOUS MY SUPPER WAS TODAY AT MY FRIEND DREW'S UNCLE'S HOUSE. WE HAD BADASS BARBECUE AND HE GAVE US BEER AND MARGUERITAS. HE WAS A REALLY COOL GUY. I WANT TO GO BACK THERE SOMETIME AND HANGOUT AGAIN. HE'S GOT A REALLY NICE HOUSE AND HE'S BUILDING A STUDIO FOR RECORDING. THAT WILL BE COOL. MAYBE MY BAND-THE GOODSIDE-WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE USE OF THIS TO RECORD SOME STUFF IN THERE. WE HAVE OUR OWN STUDIO BUT IT'S IN THE DORM ROOM SO IT'S NOT REALLY EASY TO RECORD ALL THE TIME IN THERE BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT OTHER PEOPLES' SLEEPING HABITS AND WANTS AND NEEDS--THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT SUCHS ABOUT THE DORMS. IT KIND OF CRAMPS THE LIFESTYLE OF SOMEONE WHO MAKES A LOT OF NOISE. WELL, I'VE GONE OVER MY TWENTY MINUTE MINIMUM, SO I'LL GO AHEAD A START READING FOR OTHER CLASSES. . ",1

360,"Adjusting to the classes, increased freedom and increases in ""having a good time"" have all been fairly easy to get used to. Meeting new people has been exciting and the ""name game of trying"" to remember everyone I have met has been a challenge. This Labor Day weekend I saw the huge different between high school and college as I decided to take a road trip with three other friends to Galveston, a popular Labor Day hangout. I don't know if it was the college parties that made  the night we were there seem dull or just that several key things were missing that usually made the time memorable. Seeing my younger friends made me feel out of place, and talk of curfew violations almost made me laugh. One thing is for sure those times are over and  getting further away, but also new and improved times are ahead. This weekend has also showed me that I am a very patient person. My roommate Paul has shown this to me. Having my windshield broken, being almost evicted from our apartment and being irresponsible are just a few of my things my roommate has done this weekend. If I am still sane at the end of the year I think that I will be a stronger person, because of having to deal with Paul. I feel the classes are picking up as professors start talking about future exams. O, I almost forgot to mention my goals for this year (in no specific order)- get good grades (a 4. 0), not get fatter, stupider, not get into too much trouble and have a blast. Basically I hope to work hard and play hard. ",1
1523,"     I'm really not sure what exactly I am suppossed to write about so I thought I would write about the biggest thing that has been on my mind these days, and that's September 11th. That morning I woke up and things didn't seem any different. I put on my I love New York shirt and went to class. Truthfully, I was very dissapointed with the people here at UT and how they acted that day. People in my freshman seminar were actually really rude about it. The tower played American Songs for about 10 minutes and they were really mad about it. It was   getting in the way of our discussion.   WHATEVER!!  We should have been discussing September 11!!  One girl in the class said,   Who cares!!  People die every day!!  We kill people in Afganistan every day and we don't hold memorials for them!!    I personally was outraged by that comment. How disrespectful for her to say that on a day like that. That night I went with my friends to the memorial at the tower. We stayed for a couple minutes and then proceeded to walk to the capital building for the memorial that was held there. It was awesome. To be standing there next to my friends, people that I loved, and listen to the songs and here the speeches was very emotional. To hear the bagpipes play and see the fireman and the policeofficers. And then a fire man talked about how when they lose a fireman they ring the firebell, so they did that. The whole crowd stood in silence while it rang. It was very powerful. You couldn't help but stand there and think about the officers in New York who had gone into the world trade centers, doing their job and knowing that they could be killed but WANTING to go in anyways. I had to think about all the families who walked around for days not knowing if their family members were dead or alive. Walking from hospital to hospital praying that they would be there. And in the weeks after, hoping that they would even find them dead, just so there would be some closure and they wouldn't have to wonder anymore. At the capital, the police or whatever it was also shot the rifles off. I forget what that is called but that was also a very powerful moment. In almost every person in the crowd's eyes there were tears. You couldn't help it. Then the whole crowd sang God Bless America. Hearing this and looking out over the top and seeing all these people of all different ages and sexes and races holding their american flags up above their heads and just singing GOD BLESS AMERICA was absolutely amazing. I knelt down where I was and said a prayer to thank God for my family and my friends and for the fact that was SO blessed. I picked up the phone and called my mom to tell her that I love her. My family is the most important thing in the world to me and if I lost any of them I don't know how I could even go on. When it was over, two huge beams of light shone up from the back of the capital building to represent the twin towers. It made me think about the pictures I had seen from ground zero of the towers of light they had there. A very powerful sight. The man who was talking over the microphone said that the two huge lights that were shining behind the capital were both there in Pearl Harbor on December 7th. That was an amazing thought to me also. It was also very symbolic to show that the two lights had managed to withstand something that horrible and are now representing hope after another great American tragedy. However, this was a tragedy but not just that. In fact, it brought america closer than it has been in a really long time. I saw a commericial that gave me the chills. It was a video shot of a row of normal looking houses in a normal looking American city. The voice in the background said   On September 11, 2001, terrorists tried to change America forever.   The screen faded out, and then it slowly faded back in. The same houses were there but this time every house had like 5 or 6 american flags around it. In the yard, in the windows, hanging from the roof, just everywere. The voice said   They succeeded.   I think that is a perfect way to say what September 11 has done for America. Yea, so many people lost their lives, but people in AMerica are showing pride that they haven't shown in a long time. At this point in my life, I am VERY PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN. ",0
1590,"     consious stream of thinking huh. I don't even keep journals or anything, so this is a little different. These chicken taquitos sure are good. A lot of greese though. Ya know, I really like musicals, but only ones from Andrew Loyd Webber and ones from the late 19th century like Gilbert and Sullivan. Speaking of, that was a pretty good movie. Topsey Turvey that is. I wish there had been more in there from the Pirates of P. But it was still pretty good. I can't believe that I have a lecture to go to at 5 to 6:30. At least is isn't on friday. That would really suck. I should download some songs from the Beatles. In fact, I should buy The Yellow Submarine on DVD. That would be a good movie to have. I wonder what movie I should go see this weekend. I haven't been to the movies in a really long time, so surely something new has come out by now. I wonder what these writing assignments are going to be used for. I'm sure it is used in reasearch on us. Oh well. I need to write Kim an e-mail. I haven't see her or Kate in a really long time. They would probably appreciate that. I'll do that tonight after I finish reading the Iliad. I need to read The Rupublic. I meant to a year or two ago, but I never got around to it. I didn't like my classical civilization class at first, but now I'm really getting into it. I don't know if I really want to bother learning guitar or not. I know it is never something that I would seriously persue, but still. At least I've already learned one instrument, so learning another can't be that difficult. Just learn a new clef and everything else is technical stuff that just takes practice. I might as well, I see to have plenty of time on my hands. Except for in the mornings. The past two mornings I've set my alarm early so I could wake up and get some reading done for class. Too bad that both mornings I've overslept and yesterday I was late to physics. Not that it really mattered. I could not go for the rest of the year and still do fine on the final. It's easier than what I took in high-school. My mom called me the other day. I was at starbucks, so I didn't really talk very long. I'll have to call her back tonight when I get in. I'm sure that they miss me. It doesn't feel all that different then when I was at home. I guess I might be homesick if I was going to school in like Vermont or something like Sara is, but I'm 3 hours away so it doesn't seem like that big of a deal. I guess it helps also that I stay busy. I also really like oldies music, and soundtracks too. I really want to go buy a Phantom of the Opera CD today. I'll see if they have it at Barnes and Noble although it will be an outrageous price. Sarah Brightman is a really good singer. It really helped that she was married to Webber. That must have been a big career booster. It really doesn't see like I've written all that much. There is a lot more goig on in my head, but I just can't get it all out. Some of the musicals that I really don't like are the ones that came out of a post depression era. They just aren't very original and all seem to be cookie cutter creations just for the sake of being made. ",1
2144,"This is harder than I thought! Imagine trying to write down what ever comes to your head. most of the time there are so many thoughts coming to my head I don't know which ones to notice and write or whether they are appropriate to write in the first place. hmmm. ok . psychology. I'm glad I took psychology, never down it before it is actually interesting, getting graded for thinking for horrible that lamp which I am looking at right now is- insane! Why did I buy it? Oh this is a great song!. UT-Austin?. amazing place. I can't believe I didn't like in the first week. It is so full life. I actually enjoy . classes!

286,Right now I am tired and I am thinking about going to bed. I imagine what my classes will be like in thew morning and that I have to get up at 9:40 to be  ready on time for my Astronomy class. I think if I have any home work or stuff  that I have to have done for class. I then think of my next class which is Psychology. I think if I have any preparation I need to do for that class. I then think about what I'm gonna eat for breakfast and then for lunch. I then think that I need to go to the Microcenter  to get the software I need for my business classes. I am disrupted by one of my friends who call me on ICQ. I talk to him for a few minutes and then get back to writing. I then immediately receive a phone call  and I talk on the phone for about 5 min. Then I begin to worry how long I've been typing for and I try to remember when I started. I feel that it is time to go to bed so I decide to submit  the assignment. ,0
802,"At the moment, I am tired. I just woke up a little while ago, and I'm writing. I can't stand writing. I don't mind the work. It's just that writing doesn't come naturally to me. I was wondering the other day, If college was reall going to change me into the genius I expect to be. I mean, when I get out into the career world, will I know ""everything"" I need to know about my job? Will I have to know everything? Will there be room for training and learning? Confusion! I guess its not a bad thing, but to be confused is embarrasing. I guess what I'm really getting at is without confusion life would be absolutely tedious. As I sit here in my apartment, closed off from society, I can't help but realize how much I miss my family back home. Although college is my main priority and the fact that I don't care what anyone thinks about me, I can't help but wonder if my family thinks I can make it or not, if I have what it takes. That is always in my mind somewhere. I, myself, know I can make it. I know I have what it takes to succeed. However, when I do graduate and get a career job, is that it? Is that going to be my life until I retire. I am very spontaneous and I won't be able to stand getting into a daily routine. I stopped writing for a second to gather my thoughts and I read the assignment again. I have no earthly idea how my mind works or why it works like it does. I'm not a scientist and I don't care to be. I just want to be happy. ",1
2268,"Hello, my name is Jason. I felt like I needed to introduce myself since someone will be reading this assignment, and I am not familiar with that person. Anyhow, lets talk about some stuff. Hmm, where should I begin? I was born in Alice. If your thinking this is like a biography, then I think that you will be wrong. However, back to what I was saying. I don't really like traveling to Alice, TX. I find it kind of boring because I don't have anyone over there that is my age. All of my relatives are much older than I. These people don't tend to interest me because they are always bogged down with the problems that they create. Lets talk about my uncle for instance. I will not mention his name, however, he was. I mean is a drug addict and is constantly in and out of jail. Why would I be interested in going and visiting him unless I wanted some crack or something? He is a liar anyways, and I don't like affiliating myself with those kinds of people. Speaking of the kind of people I affiliate (if that's even how u spell the word) myself with, I think that I accidentally roomed with a gay person this semester. Had to look over my shoulder to make sure he's not behind me or something. However, he makes a lot of homosexual remarks, and although he says he is just playing, I think he does it all too frequently to be playing around. Anyways, I'm sick of talking about him because that guy is more and more annoying everyday. Lets talk about my big brother. Now this guy is someone who has his crap cut out. This is the reason that I look up to him. He knows how to manage his time, talk to his gf on the telephone for hours at a time, go out on the weekends, and still get all A's! I have to admit that I am somewhat jealous. However, he does help me out and gives really great advice. When he tutors me, I feel like he teaches better than a lot of professors. Maybe this is because he has known me for so long and knows how I retain material. He is two years older than me, but I am tired of talking about him because he always hogs the damn spotlight. Lets talk about my boxing, because that always gets me the respect and acknowledgement that I feel is so precious to a person. I hated not being respected. It made me sick to my stomach when someone would cut me in line or throw a pencil or whatnot at me and I couldn't do anything about it because that person had a physical strength advantage over me. However, I put an end to all that crap when I joined the boxing team in the summer of my freshman year in high school. I learned how to fight the hard way though. My coach sucked and didn't teach me a thing, so I just kept fighting and watching fights and picked up on different styles and tricks of the trade. I adopted a slugger's style of fighting. The reason is because my foot movement was never all that great. My strength began to get developed when I began lifting weights in my freshman year, and it suited my fighting style great. That year, a couple of kids decided to mess with me, so I took them to the mat room (part of the gym in my high school), and floored them one by one. Man it was great, the respect that those fights generated was awesome. From then on out, word of mouth about those fights got me my respect. I didn't even have to fight anymore! But I kept on because I got too competitive and I kind of liked it. Currently, I'm undefeated in my hometown. However, I was just an average fighter when it came to the Golden Gloves. I stopped when I started college. That's enough of that. My father is the next person I want to discuss. He has worked his way from rock bottom, and I admire that. He slept in a car for 6 months and bathed in a nearby river when he was working in maintenance away (for a railroad company called Southern Pacific). He helps us out so much and he's funding my tuition for college all by himself (cause my mom divorced him a couple of years ago). I still love her and all, I just don't agree with anything she does. She seems to have tunnel vision, u know what I mean? Let me explain because my time here is almost up. She is one of those people who will see something she wants, and direct all of her attention to acquiring that one thing, no matter who she hurts. Today she seems more like a stranger, cause I don't see her all that much. She didn't invite me to her wedding. My time is up. Talk to u later. Bye ",0
1193,"Sometimes I wonder what everything is worth in the big scheme of things. Growing up, making friends, going to school, learning amazing things, falling in love, and well, I guess living in general. What is our purpose here. to consume as much food as possible on a daily basis, to desire nothing but to be rich, spoiled, to care not for our neighbors, but for what kinds of cars we drive. I wonder if that was His plan when this all started or if we've really messed up. In a sense, we've grown as far from following in his steps as possible and it's really scary to me. As a follower of the times, my faith in Him has also declined as the years have gone on. Well, on to another aspect of worthiness. friendships. Although necessary for life, and powerful while they last, why do all friendships seem to come to an end. Whether it is due to personal reasons or unplanned ones, each and every friendship must reach an end at some time. As I entered high school, I was very afraid of my future, of the immensity of my school, and the immensity of my life. But I realized that life is only as big as you make it. If you choose, you can have a closeknit group of friends or a large selection of various types of friends. its up to you. But back to my point. I made many friends in high school, but only a handful that will continue to have my friendship as I've moved to the next step in my life. My five best friends, my girlfriend, and a few others are only a hundredth of the people that I knew in my high school days, but now they are most likely out of my life forever, not by choice, but by nature. Don't get me wrong, I am very excited to be in college and out of high school, but I don't think that I realized what I was losing. My best friend with whom I spent countless days after school shooting hoops, watching movies, ordering pizza, and just hanging out decided to go to another school than me. I didn't realize how much I would miss him until he left. When I see him for the first time, it's going to be a relief, but when will that time come, and it's only going to last for short period of time. My girlfriend also chose another school, but hers was four states away. I knew leaving her would be most difficult, but I underestimated the pain. I miss seeing her every day and hearing about the intricate details of her life. what she had for breakfast, how her math test was, what she wore to school, when she got off work, how her family was, and many other little things that are often ignored when someone is around all the time. I feel like I don't know her as well as I used to and I wonder if I ever will. The leaving cut our relationship short, which also makes me wonder if our ever after will ever have a chance to grow. I guess the point of this is that sometimes we don't realize what we have until it's gone. and maybe realizing is worse, or maybe it's better, I don't know. Anyhow, I wonder why we're here, and maybe being away from everyone will help me figure it all out. But for now, I guess my hopes and dreams will drive me to care not what everything is worth, but to be happy that we get a chance to be here, happy we get a chance to grow up, make friends, go to school, learn amazing things, fall in love, and, of course, be alive!

423,"of course I don't ever really cry--or at least not very often. I've been waiting for a really big cry since I moved here a month ago--but no tears. I left some of my best friends--though I have over a dozen friends here from my home town of College Station--but not all of them and I left my house and my birth city and my parents and two of my dogs(the third one I brought with me). though I don't really know why I am writing this to the computer as if it will respond back or much less cares at all about my personal life. I suppose that i am just suppose to ramble and write what is in my head--yes I am so tired that I am repeating the directions for this assignment out loud to myself and I am actually so bored and tired as to write them down as part of my assignment. I suppose that that bit alright. it is now 1:28 am and that means that technically I cannot write again until after mid night tomorrow or today or whatever which is too bad because that would make my life easier to be able to do it tomorrow afternoon because I only have one class but I suppose I should stop bitching at the computer. because frankly it is a computer--of course now I am worried that this should have been some philosophical expression of how I, erin, tick as a human being--but now I am way to tired to rewrite this--if it won't send properly then I promise myself to do something deeper next time--for now, however, I'm done.

1754,"I am sitting in my dorm room right now and I just thought it would be a good idea to go ahead and do my psychology homework because I don't have anything to do and there doesn't seem to be anything interesting on TV. I was so stressed out earlier today because I can not hack it in my calc. class. I went to class though only to affirm what I had previously believed. YEAH RIGHT. I used to think I was pretty smart but being in that class made me see that I am not going to be able to excell in math or the college of natural sciences for that matter. Simply for the fact that math is required. I am actually happier though because now I have eliminated one course of studies and narrowed my choices. I like that. I like feeling a little more directed with college and the future. I am leaning towards transfering to the college of communications. I also added RTF 305 to my schedule. I am so excited for it. People annoy the crap out of me. Sometimes I wish I could just crawl into a box and never come out. Call me a crab but I don't really care. I am what I am. I feel chubby right now. I want to eat but then I don't. I know the consequences of putting food in my mouth when I don't truly want it. Wasters never want. . . good quote. Very true. I have come so far in my life. I can't believe I am finally at college. . on my own. There are so many things to be thankful for in my life and in so many ways I am lucky. It is hard to keep a clear perspective all of the time. That is the problem with being human. . . we are always failing. Falling short of the glory of God. It is so much more difficult to loose weight for the second time. I lost muscle and gained fat and now it takes longer and I also have more fat cells that will naturally hold on to the chubbs!! I will keep working on consistency and the important thing is to be persistant. I can't believe I used to sell knives this summer. Seems like 3 years ago but it was actually just aboout ago. One day, I hope there is an invention to where you can eat and eat and eat and it wouldn't matter at all. I would pay good money for that. I am sure every woman in the U. S. would do the same. I bet my skin has a lot of sun damage. I tan too often but I do like the feeling and I am not going to stop. ",0
2174,"I just started playing the Smiths. I kind of consciously did that because I wanted to see how that would make me feel while doing this assignment. I think it would be pretty funny if I had put whilst on that last sentence instead of while. Anyways, I had to put it down now because I'm now conscious of the fact that I started listening to the Smiths so I could say I was listening to them whilst typing this. There I did it, I put whilst. I also kinda put the Smiths on here probably so that if someone reads this then they'll know     I listen to the Smiths. I do that a lot. I specific music whenever people around, I don't know, I guess so they'll think it's cool or something. I've been feeling really lonely recently. I was thinking about that because I wonder if anyone is going to read this, and if they do, if all this stuff being collected is going to be used so we can learn something about ourselves. I don't really want to hide anything, because I'd rather someone tell me what the hell is wrong with me, than type jive like, oh I don't know what to write, blah blah, school was fun today, because I feel really fucked up recently. I don't want things to change, this shit is so gay. Sorry, I know we're supposed to type thoughts but that's still pretty bad. I was happy this summer with a girlfriend and my friends around, but then we had to break up because she went away for college, and I freaked out on her which wasn't cool, but I was just really scared. Yes, this song is awesome. I should probably go to the mental health center, but I'm scared of the process of signing up for an appointment, probably more than actually telling someone something, because then I have to talk to real people and I'm not so good at that. That's why I'm really lonely lately, I don't know how to talk to people, and I'm meeting all these new people, and I have no idea what to say, so I just don't say anything. I'd kind of really like to meet some new people, because I hate sitting around my room all the time, even though that's all I do. I'm scared to like walk up and talk to someone though. It's quite a frightening experience, and I get all nervous when I'm around people. This typing is really hurting my shoulder because I'm on my laptop. Shit, I just hit the back button. Alright, I'm going to keep typing, but this is really gay, now I got to tack on another 10 minutes. Whoever reads this is probably going to be pissed that they have to read a 1/3 more than everyone else. Well, I better not get in trouble for it is all I can say. Speaking of gay, I called my girlfriend, I guess ex-girlfriend, because I want to keep in touch with her, and she told me about how she saw this guy with a Dashboard Confessional sticker and a Smiths sticker on his backpack, and she told me about how she and her new friend went up to him and asked him if he actually listened to good music or not, it being assumed that Dashboard Confession is pretty crappy, (and who's to blame that assumption, with lyrics like, Far away from all the stupid questions / 'Hey, did you get some' / Man that is so dumb"") nonetheless, what the hell is she talking about, she didn't even know who the Smiths were until like a month ago when I told her about them, and I mean, I still think it's funny, but a lot of the music she is into now is from me. I don't know, I think I am just pissed off because she wanted to break up. But, it's perfectly reasonable, we're completely across the country,  I'm being ridiculous I know, it just ended so fast, and I'm still upset. Ahh, this isn't fair, I still have 13 minutes left because I hit back somehow, this is going to take forever. My shoulder is kind of starting to hurt, I think this is a really cool assignment, because it's just stream of consciousness, but it's taking forever, Agamemnon. That's what I say when I'm saying Aggh, or something, because it sounds cooler. I can't stop thinking about my girlfriend. I really think I have some sort of problem with dependence, I feel like I HAVE to be around people most of the time or I start to feel sort of depressed, like no one cares about me. This being away from some of my friends and alone in this new environment, is making things worse. My History of the Banjo teacher, that's a freshman seminar, told us we had to grow our nails out longer to play the banjo, and it's driving me crazy, because     I hate semi-long nails, they always feel dirty, and I can feel them now whilst I type, clacking against the keys, it's irritating. I think there's something wrong with my smell, I don't think I can smell anything. That wouldn't be surprising anyways, I think there's something wrong with everything about me and everything I do. I always seem to fail at anything I try, I can get good grades, but I've been missing assignments in college already, which is just compounding things and making things worse. aggh, or I mean agamemnon. I keep looking at this scratch on my arm, where I cut myself with a razor. I don't think I'll do that again, I was feeling really depressed on Saturday, I didn't eat anything all weekend, and I normally regimen my meals very carefully, but I didn't eat anything, and feeling depressed and having read about self-injury, I wanted to try it, but cutting myself with a razor didn't feel particularly painful or punishing, and hardly seemed worth the effort involved, considering you have to clean up the blood, so I don't think I'll bother with that again. I can't even do that right. I've actually been feeling better the rest of this week, but I kinda want to talk to someone, just because I don't think there's any guarantee I won't feel like I did on Saturday again, and I felt terrible Saturday morning. That was until I did DXM, which of course made me realize that things will eventually work themselves out. I just wish I could manage to carry that feeling over into the real world, because not worrying about things is such a beautiful feeling. I think I worry too much, but I'm always sure that as soon as I get by myself no one's going to ever want to see me again and I'll be stuck like that. I wish I could meet some people here, but I don't know what to say. It's hard to just talk to someone, it's always boring conversation, and at the end, they always go their own way, and never want to do something with you again. No matter how good you try to make the conversation, they never seem to want to continue after that, despite reading constantly that the way to make friends is to simply talk to someone. Bullshit.

1943,"Hmmm. lets see well nothing is really going on. I have to go to the doctor tomorrow at 10:15 because I have a sinus infection. a few things about it though are kind of fishy. I have to see a sports medicine doctor, not a real doctor. Also, the guy on the phone was a little weird. I am also scared that  by tomorrow I will be well again and won't need to go to the doctor. I have been sick for three weeks and am tired of being sick so I guess I should go. I kind of miss my room at home. It is hard to have to share a room with someone. This is the first time I have never had a room all to myself. Sometimes I wish the room was just mine but I am ok with it because I know it is good to have a room mate. Christine is nice, she is just a little whiney sometimes and always breaks things. I really need to work out but I cannot because of this sinus infection that I have. When I run, or even walk, my face hurts a lot from the sinus fluids in it. How that works, I don't know. I was thinking about it. How can sinus fluid hurt your face. I could ask the doctor, but I am too lazy to listen to the answer so I won't. Hmmm. whatever is on my mind. I really have a lot of studying to do. It is 10:00 in the morning and I woke up just to study. Getting this done though makes me feel as if I have gotten something accomplished. I like that feeling of accomplishment. Everytime you do something you get a check. Chapter 1: Check, Chapter 2: Check. The check feels really good. I don't know why it feels so good but it does. I am kind of concerned right now about the time. This clock on the computer is really off but I am using it anyway. I just have to time 20 minutes right? I have ten minutes left. I have rally never known how to spell the word minute. I don't even know if that is right. For all I know that could be the for minute(as in small) I even spelled it one time minuet, but latter found to my embarrassment, that unless I was talking about music, it wasn't. So for now I just always right minutes. as the abbreviation, in order to spare myself the pain and embarrassment of spelling it wrong, even though I just spelled embarrassment wrong and still don't know which spelling I typed it wrong. I am actually a good speller, I promise. I just get confused sometimes. This it boring for me so it must be boring for whoever is reading it. I guess I will type about something interesting. Hmmmm lets see. I really want Matheus(sp) to do that recording test on me. The one where is records every five minutes. (See there that word is ageing) I really would like to know what is going on in my life. So far this is what I think is going on but I am not really sure. I am sick and am going to the doctor tomorrow. I need to get a bike because my classes are too far away. I am mad a some of my friends for getting football tickets without me: I stood in line for an hour last week by myself to get them for them. I don't have a football ticket. I think I might go to Fort Worth instead for the weekend because my grandpa is sick. He is not really sick, just a little depressed because he is getting old. I thought I might cheer him up. It makes my grandma up set so I though she could use some cheering up too. And this is why I need to take the Recording test. Because I hope, if not already think there is something more going on in my life that I do not realize. It has been 20 minutes- good bye. ",1
2395,     I wonder if he is going to call me tonight. I wonder if he cares or if he just wanted some. I hate guys like that. why do I always fall for a guy and just end up getting hurt. Ray must really not give 2 shits about me. I gave him all of my heart and he just broke it. why are guys like that. I hope my cat doesn't hurt my hampster. do rats really not get depressed I wish I was a rat I can't handle being depressed anymore it seems like I will never be happy doesn't anyone care about me I just want someone to love because I know I have so much love to give. I wonder if I like manny or if it is just a fling. either way I had fun with him. I probably shouldn't have stayed with him those nights but I enjoyed it. I wish we could be together right now. I wonder what he is doing does he want me or what. I really just want someone to want me. I don't want to be alone anymore. I have so much homework I have to do. if I don't  do better then I will be kicked out of ut that can't happen my parents will be so pissed  I need to make a's in all my classes why can't I do it am I really stupid or what I just want to be happpy is that too much to ask for. I wish manny would call he's so cute and smart but I don't know what the deal is I don't want to sit by myself tonight.

I hope there are some good parties tonight maybe I will meet someone tonight I think I'm pretty does no one else I always get attention so why am I by myself I really need to do something all I ever do is homework I am so tired I need more sleep it seems like I never have a break and I don't know how much more I can do without just callapsing I wonder if I should call manny but if he wanted to talk to me he would call so should I wait for him to call me or should I call him I don't know I really want to see him when I woke up next to him monday morning he told me to call me him but he didn't answer but he called last night at like 12:30 I called him back today and still haven't heard from him I hope he calls ,1
65,"I am currently sitting in the computer lab in the lobby of Jester. I have just finished my final class for the day, so I figured that I would go ahead and get caught up on my homework for my psychology class. I have never taken any kind  of psychology class, so I don't really know what to expect. Hopefully it won't be a hard class because some of my other ones are pretty hard, and I wasn't use to doing a lot of work and studying in high school. I liked high school a lot, and kind of wish that I was still in it. I sort of miss all of my friends and it just isn't the same to party without all of them. I went home for the Labor Day holidays and partied with them, but now that I'm back in Austin everything has changed back again. I haven't really met many people since I've been here, but I can say that there are quite a few weird people. Hopefully I will get use to Austin soon because it hasn't really worked out too well just yet. I've  already received two speeding tickets, a parking ticket, and had my truck towed once since I moved in two weeks ago. My parents aren't too happy with me right  now, so I've got to get good grades to get them off of my back. I keep screwing  up on this computer and don't really know what I'm doing. I never have been too good with computers-even though I have taken several classes in high school. I  can type rather quickly, but that is about all. My fingers are getting tired of typing because I haven't typed all summer. I guess I need to get use to it since I'm going to be doing a lot of it now that I'm in college. I'm not too happy  right now because I have to type this paper in the lobby computer room. I just  brought back with me a notebook computer that my mom gave me, but I can't get the CD-ROM to work. The stupid thing won't read the disks for some reason, so I haven't been able to hook up the UT Connect package that I just bought. I think I made a few people mad when I went to purchase that UT Connect package because  there was a long line and I sort of cut to the front on accident. I was just  trying to ask the person a question about what line to get in, and he thought  that I had already been waiting, and that it was my turn. Even though the guy that I cut in front of looked kinda pissed, I wasn't about to turn around and  get at the back of the line. Last week I waited in it over an hour and even  though I feel kinda bad for that guy, it was worth it. My eyes are getting tired of staring at this screen and I'm for my time to be up. I guess I still have a  few minutes until dinner starts so I'll write for a little while longer. I didn't get much sleep last night because I just couldn't fall asleep for some reason. Some friends and I watched the movie The Program, and that lasted until about 2:30, and I still couldn't go to bed after that. I didn't have to wake up until 10:00, but I only had like 5 hours of sleep. Hopefully I can go to bed tonight with no problem. My hands are getting a little sweaty from typing so much, but I really do like to type. I'm not all familiar with the internet and the web, but  I would like to be. I'm in an English lab class, so that will probably help me out a lot. I'm sitting next a guy that can type about 400 words a second-at least that's what it sounds like-and it is kind of getting on my nerves. ",1
2259,"my boyfriend is in the room and he stinks like a dirty/sweaty boy. I came over to his apt to do this homework. and then we were going to go to tops as well to get some super cute pictures of ourselves. I am also eating cheetos so it it causing me to type slower than normal. I'm usually a really fast typer, because I've had a computer for a long time. my dad is a programmer so we have always had a computer in our house. he wanted me to do computer science and I did as well, but when I came to UT I found out it is totally wrong for me. I just switched to retail merchandising and I'm not sure if that is right for me either but better than CS was. I think its funny how older people(no offense) are not really connected to the computer. the computer, can do so many wonderful things, I can't even see my life without one. don't think I'm a dork just because I said I was in CS, but take for example doing this homework online. its just so much easier to sit here and type and then turn it in electronically and then its saved to some machine and no one really had to put too much effort into it. it was a very easy/simple task. that's amazing. they said that my generation will spend like 12 years of there life online and I believe it. there is just so much to do online. I feel like I might be typing bad, but I'd like you to excuse that. I'm not really checking spelling and what not just typing. I wonder what you actually look for in these type of things, how you judge people off what they typed and then how you sort them into groups. I mean I'd hate to see what you think of me now, but it would be interesting to see if any of it really matched up to be true. so I totally love Paris Hilton, she is such a riot. I think its funny people don't like her because she has everything and because of the way she acted on her show. but I wont get into that, however she came out with a new book. I want to read it, I think it will be amusing. on a side note, I'm not really sure why I'm eating cheetos, I don't really like them, just every now and then I crave them. I absolutely hate how they make your mouth orange and gross feeling. I just   dropped one on my lap and it left that residue and its gross to think that is all in  your teeth. I really hope this thing is self timed and not expecting me to be timing myself. I never realized 20 minutes would feel like so long. maybe because I'm starving and I just want to go eat and go to tops, it feels like that. I hate that. how are you suppose to do something  that feels like eternity. I feel bad because its like my boyfriend is waiting on me to finish this so we can go. I was going to do it earlier but I was having a hard time getting the pre-screening thing to work. then once I did it takes so freaking long to load each page its like pointless. you almost just want to not look and just click each thing as fast as you can to get it over with, because its so freaking slow. I still have to go back and finish that and I dread it. however, I think my boyfriend is entertained now because I can here he is playing playstation two in the next room. gosh I'm so hungry and this is taking way to long. I have now moved on to goldfish to eat. speaking of eating in that pre screening thing all those questions about food and over eating. wow. I feel bad that so many people have eating disorders, I know quite a few. so many things for girls to be stressed about. I hate how people just think you can diet and loose it all. they think its all just food related. I hate how little kids are so fat today. I wish people would help teach kids how to eat. they let them eat ANYTHING. they are so worried about other things it seems like they forget to teach them about diet and exercise. or they don't set the example themselves. my hair stylist has this really great trick where she only lets her kids have 1 coke aka soda per day and they only get it in the evening if they have done ALL their homework and their daily chore. then they also get a snack  sized candy (the little bitty bite size) as a treat as well for doing their homework and stuff and the kids thing that is such a treat. then there are kids who drink like 8 cokes a day. crazy crazy. I wonder what it is like for your generation to look down on us and you probably think we are all lazy. we use the computer for everything and our clothes and music. its just rather funny how everyone is amazed by the last generation. I'm really starting to wonder is this is self timed or computer timed. I can't imagine it not being computer timed. I can't imagine being the person who reads all this crap. it has to get old and what happens if you miss something important?  that could suck all that work and you miss a small detail. but that could happen anywhere I guess. I'm so hungry its not funny. I'm glad I don't have to pee or anything that would just suck. I feel like my mind is going blank because I'm so bored. I wonder if people ever fall asleep doing this. it would be easy. gosh its really bothering me the time thing at the top doesn't have any numbers. like its keeping time per say. I'm quitting this at 4 o'clock even if this thing doesn't stop itself because I know I'll be over the time if I wait till 4 so you can't cut my grade cause your thing didn't work. oh crap this clock is fast so I'll quit like 8 min before 4 and that should be even. I feel like I started this at 3:30 hmmmmmm I can't really remember. damn it. this sucks ass. I don't see how this is helping you. just making me get annoyed because I don't know when I started so i dont know when I can end and just go on with my life. I wonder if you really do read all of these or just skim it or run it through a word finder. I feel like this is pointless and I'm past my typing time. I have no concept of time, but I don't know if anyone really does. just depends on what they are doing or what's going on around them and etc. time is a funny thing. more goldfish to cure my growling stomach/boredom. ouch I just kicked the computer or something underneath me. and it hurt. to bad I'm not on my computer cause then I could be laying in bed doing this. wireless and laptops. genius. the count down to me hitting the finish button and quitting all of this is t-minus 3 minutes and counting. 3:55 will be the new time for completion. 3 more minutes. and I'm stumped. I don't know what to type/talk about. ooooooo 2 minutes and counting. ok randomness:  I am not sure what I'm going to do tonight, I might go to a party or something, however I'm not going to dress up really cause I'm just feeling a chill vibe. 0ne minute. . and probably have a few drinks, or either rent movies and stay the night in with my boyfriend. sweet guy. not sure we are completely on the same page, but we have years for that to develop. . Times up. ",1
998,what am I thinking about don't got the foggest clue. looking to see how long I have to write for and what I am going to write about. thinking about a wonderful girl that I wish to be close to just wondering if she wants the smae or if I want to see other people. I do miss having my sister in the same city as me she really has meant a lot to me in the past few years and I do wish she was here. but then again I am loving all of my freedom here. have not talked to my mom in a few days and I like it she is not hounding me to do anything. niether is my grandmother. wonder why kellys dad wanted to talk to me. do miss kelly a little but hopefully we can still be friends  wonder what nicole is doing right now. this is the third time I tried to write but the other tow trys I go restless and stop writing. really did not know what to say but now I am just hoping it is not to late for these writing assignments. always seem to wait till the last minute. I cna hear thoughts in my mind but don't know how to put them into words. or which one should I write about first. lunch was good and now I am feeling better because I got something to eat. don't want to work anymmore at eddie bauer because I don't like it anymore and I don't want to work there because I may have something better to do and plus I hope I can find someone to work for me tomarrow so I can go to the training session to be an offical for intermural football. hope my family is doing ok have not heard from them lately. still have ten minutes to write. my mind is completly blank I keep thinking about this book we read last year in english it was written in stream of thought. hope the professer got my email about the brain test to see if a person is right or left brained. nose itches. relly wish we did not have to do this. or at least not for so long. ok sitting like this is not the easiet  ok that is better. morrre comfortable. hope miriam can go this weekend to george carlin have not talked to her in a week and hope everything is going good with her. my neighbors are wierd they play some stange fucked up music. hope I do good on my quiz tommarow I need to study and catch up on my readings. need to know when my calculus test is. and my eco. test. hope the pysc test is not soon. really need to catch up on some reading. hope nicold can everything taken care of so she is not so stressed out. I love spending time with her she is so wonderfull. I think I may love her but then again I still have a wondering eye. I want to meet nwe people and who know the right woman may be out ther but right now I think she is the one. ok good time is up. ,1
1728,"     I thnik that after this I'll do my chemistry homework and get it out the way. It will probably take me forever eventhough it's only 10 questions because I still need to read. My Incubius CD is ending. I need to ask Christina to start it again. I am wonder how I'm going to really learn how to speak Latin. I know I'll be able to read and Write it. When is my computer going to come in?  I feel like I'm intruding on Christina everytime I use her lap top. I'm drawing a blank. Get up Tina. I'm never good at this stream of thought stuff cause I'm always thinking about the stream of thought like in english class last year when Mrs. Posern asked us to do it for. . I guess it was ten minutes. I miss her. I miss Clinton and Pakey. I wonder what Pakey's doing right now. Probably out somewhere in Houston. I love this song. I really want to play guitar. I hope I make the band next year. That dream was wierd last night or this morning or something like that. Singing would be so often for a living. I've always liked being on the go constantly. I'm so organized and yet never organized enough. I wanna' here my song again. That's so wierd, when one song is on you can't think of another on. Those girls next door were really loud earlier today. What were they doing?  I don't dress up very much. I still don't understand how people can where heels to an amusement park. Six Flags was fun this summer. I love this song. I'd love to see them live. I wonder what there like in person. He has such an amazing voice.  I wonder how my voice would improve if I were to take lessons. I need to exercise more. That would definitly improve my lung capcity and my playing. I'm so upset I didn't make the band. I'm proud of myself though because I sightread music while everyone else had had their music for a whie. What am I going to play next year for an audition. I don't know. I need to practice again. Is my music here?  I need to send the pool key to my mom. I also need to find a church before my mom kills me. I want to go see My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Maybe we'll go sometime this week. I don't know. How much time left. Okay. Um. I did a really. times up. ",1
2263,"wow I just turned on my music a little too loud. that really scared me for a second. let's get this straightened out a bit I'm so glad I'm listening to this cd it reminds me of Chris, who I miss terribly at the moment. I wonder why he didn't call me back last night well I guess it was really late and he probably had stuff to do, his chemistry homework and stuff like that. I think it's really funny that his roommate's name is hank and he's Chinese, that's just funny. my feet are really cold even though I have on socks and my slippers I guess it's just that I always get really cold in hardin house I don't know why they keep it like a refrigerator in here. everything's going to be alright, rockabye. I like this song a lot. all her friends tell her she's so pretty, she'd be a whole lot prettier if she smiled once in a while. so Fiji has a foam party planned for tomorrow night and I think that's going to be a lot of fun, except I don't know, the thought of being in a room of foam really freaks me out. I get really claustrophobic, especially when I feel like I can't breathe, kind of like when I go to sleep and I like to pull the covers up over me but I always have to make sure there's a way for a lot of air to get in and out because otherwise it just freaks me out. anyways, I think it'll be fun but I'm not sure if I'm going to get in the whole way. I've been in a whiteout once, that one in beaver creek or wait no it was park city and that was so scary, I kind of think this would be like that except a lot closer and like in your face, and hopefully not as cold. though part of what makes me claustrophobic is when you get all hot and everything as well as not being able to breathe, like you feel like you can't get any fresh air like a breeze or anything. but I still really want to go in just for a minute to say I've done it. but Leila was telling me about how people like do stuff in the foam, and I don't know I'm worried because mark is a Fiji which makes me kind of not want to go over there I wonder why he's been telling his friends about me I really don't like that because I really don't like him and I know he likes me but he's kind of crazy and obsessive almost, though he's really nice, it just seems like he tries way too hard. like too hard to be so interested in your conversation and be listening and just making that ""hmmmmmm. interesting. "" like too pleasant psychologist kind of face that makes me think he's like analyzing everything I say, like I sound stupid but he's just not saying anything kind thing. I don't know I just really don't like that at all. and I think he's a little gay. well maybe not gay, but definitely metro. I think it's really funny that I've spelled definitely my whole life, and it's always been wrong but I just can't retrain myself to get it right. kind of like weird or weird. I still get them mixed up because I know I used to always write it one way and it was wrong, but now I don't know which way is right because I can never remember if I ever actually fixed it or not. I think it's weird. weird. whatever. weird. that looks a lot more right than the other way so hey we're going to go with that. I don't know what I think about will. he's also a Fiji, so if I go to foam I get to see him but I also have to deal with mark, so that's kind of like a double-edged-sword-damned if you do damned if you don't situation. I got sick of the hyphens. anyways, I think he's a really sweet guy and all, but he's just so quiet! but at the same time it's like I'm drawn to him almost because he's a dry pledge and he's cute but not all at the same time, I'm sick of this song and I'm changing it this one is happier but back to will I just don't know what I think of him. or that. whatever. I am leaving cause I love you, I am leaving cause I don't and I'm hoping you will follow and I'm praying that you won't let me go. I want to know who sings this song, Chris never told me. I still can't believe he made me all those cds on the night he left it was really fun to talk to bo yesterday, I really liked talking to him he seemed so lonely and desperate to talk to someone his own age. I miss bo. I could never tell if he really liked me or not, kind of like Travis, because it always seemed like we had the same kind of conversation every time, like hey bo how you doing I'm good ok talk to you later awkwardness kind of thing. I don't know. scratch my neck. anyways I never really knew about that but I've always liked him, 3ven after he insulted the cake at my 16th birthday party, I can't believe he didn't remember that at all and I thought it was so funny that he was just completely horrified at himself. I love that story, it's almost as classic as the cookie analogy from homecoming my sophomore year when he and Chris both wanted to ask me, and then after that when bo liked me and I liked Chris and they were fighting over me. I wonder if it was right that I brought it up that last night we were all together that was so much fun I can't believe I actually stayed there until 4 in the morning and I'm glad Chris never lit his cigar up around me that really would have made me mad even though I know bo really wanted him to, I'm glad bo didn't force the issue too much though because I would have felt bad but I didn't want him to do that around me I hate smoking so much I hope Andrew quits it'll kill him I think it's so funny that Leila figured out that he was the guy that was making out with marry at the Fiji island party, I'm glad I wasn't there because I think I would have been really embarrassed. I guess that's part of the thing about always being the sober one at different places. it's a lot of fun because you can laugh at the people that are just getting really drunk and doing stupid things but at the same time you have to take care of people and it's like you get embarrassed for them because they just have no idea what they're doing. but I like not drinking, and I like feeling like I don't have to and people accept that. it's really kind of nice wow I only have like 3 and a half minutes left that's pretty cool. but I sure am getting there. two dimes in the telephone alright, no it's not easy tonight. good song I really do love this cd I wonder if Michelle is ever going to get me that nello cd, I really would love that. or maybe if Chris could give me the cd that has that new nello song on it I loved that. he first played that for me outside of casey's house. what were we doing over there? were we going to a concert or something. maybe? I don't remember. ha-ha Hailey used to always say we went over there to see casey's brothers. they're so hot. but Kevin's married now. I don't like how I just sounded like a bimbo there I really am smart I promise. I feel really stupid in my world lit class though because I've never taken Latin and I haven't studied Greek, and I don't know I just feel like I'm behind the ball here on Dante's inferno. I like the book a lot but I'm worried about the first paper that we have due in a few weeks. starting a paper and getting the initial idea is always the worst part by far. so don't make the wrong impression I don't want raffa to think I'm like stupid it's like in hagood's class though I guess I just have to learn when to speak up, it's like I'm wow that just interrupted me and I had no idea where I was going. . I guess I just get writing and I have to get really into the stream of consciousness without letting myself put myself into editor mode. I guess that's what I have to do when I start writing a paper because instinctively I start editing myself before I even begin and then I just end up never really getting anywhere. well I'm done here. goodbye. ",1
230,Well I really do have alot I should be doing right now but I thought I would get this out of the way and I want to do it early because I am paranoid it won't get sent by some freak accident. Anyway I really need to get stuff done. I need tp study for French even though it's a French I test and I've been in French for 3 years so hopefully I will do o. k. Some guy just tried to chat with me but I told him I was busy and now I feel kinda bad. Oh well he'll get over it. People in Austin really do try to chat with other people in Austin alot. The only people that try to talk to me are online. Maybe it's because I intimidate people. I'm 6 feet tall. I like it though because most guys find it really attractive. My boyfriend loves it. He lives in New Jersey so it really doesn't matter anyway. I really love him. I met him Cancun In May after graduation and he has called me just about every night since. He's even coming down here next month to see me. I really miss him. He really can't even afford to come down because he works in a casino in Atlantic City. That actually kinda bothers me. He's 24 years old. He really needs some ambition. That's something I really admire in people. I've got alot myself. I hope to be a producer someday and live in New York. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm already ready to graduate. I miss my friends from home. Hopefully I can see Jina in 2 weeks. I may go to visit my brother at A&M so hopefully we can hang out. I really feel like people don't understand me. I really wish Rich lived closer. I know he loves me. I went with my roommate to visit her boyfriend at Baylor this weekend. It was fun. I just really miss my boyfriend even more now. I really nee to read for RTF right now. I want to read ahead for this week. I just want to get out of here. I just wish I could pack up my bags and move to Europe. I do want an education so I guess I'll stick around here for four years or so. I need to call Jina. I ran into my old boyfriend the other day but I pretended I didn't see him. He is someone I will never get over. He had the most amazing mind. He is going to be very successful one day. I feel like he is out of my league. I know I'm not but he just never really understood me. I hope I see him again this week and maybe I will have the courage to talk to him. ,1
2432,"     I havent really decided what to write about. so many things are going on in my head all the time it seems like I could write for a very long time. I do that though, I have a journal and its handy. I like to go back and read what I write and think to myself 'what an idiot'. its a learning experience really, and I hope more people use journaling to express themselves. Some people use online journals which at first I thought was odd because I write personal stuff in my journal. I wouldn't want the internet world to read all that. but then I started reading my friend's online journals and actually started one myself. Katie calls me a follower but she is a conforming nonconformist in that she claims she's not starting one because everyone else has done so and she'd like to be different. That reminds me of George, he is the classic conforming nonconformist. he hates anything anyone likes and loves anything anyone hates. especially lauren. their relationship is odd in that way. George makes a point of emphatically disliking something just to spite the rest of us. he is an interesting person to study. I am always observant but observing him is just interesting. he's like a girl and I swear he has PMS. we went on a trip to kentucky this summer and he decided he didn't want to go to the lake with the rest of the group (david and I didn't want to either) so the three of us stayed in the condo and played golf actually. but then the next day, he still didn't want to go and he made a big scene about it and then got all huffy when we Couldn't decide on a thing to do when it started raining and the lake was deemed a bad idea. he just left. he drove off in one of the two cars we had and was gone for a long time. the funny thing about chris is that he wants you to think he's cool. so he'll do and say things to seem cool and crazy. he went to a grocery store and was talking to some local teenagers and claims he was invited to go hang out with them that night. I don't know if I belive him but I really don't care. the point is that later he claimed that he 'might' go hang out with them like he was mr. popular. of course he wasn't really and the way to deal with him in his pouty state is to ignore him or somehow let him know that you don't care. He is such a confusing boy. I mean, they're all confusing but he takes the cake. having liked him before, I knew what I was getting into the last time. and the time before that. his biggest relationship flaw is that he is so flaky! so now I feel bad like I'm just judging everyone I know. grr. that's a noise I make, I make many of them. I make many faces too. at work john laughs at me because I can't control my expressions. especially if someone says something dumb. I just can't hold it in. my moms the same way. I wonder if that's learned or inherited. anyway. speaking of mom, my parents moved to florida in feb. and march. it was ok at first because I was of the opinion that I was getting an apartment so I wouldn't be living with them and wouldn't see them much anyway. but man I was wrong. I visited them in may and felt unusually emotionally detached. while I was there dad did the same annoying things he's always done, not listening, asking questions I'd just asked etc. drove me nuts. but now I miss them a lot. I was listening to Avril Lavigne and she has a song called nobodys home. and I realized that I have no where else to go. this apartment is my home now and man that's depressing. the kitchen is dirty, the floors are dirty, we need to steam clean, lauren and katie are bums and it took them 4 days to clean out MY cooler from saturday which now reeks because they left food in there to soak. people would call this bitterness. I like to claim that at least I'm expressing an emotion instead of keeping it all inside like I tend to do. I took one of those personality surveys online the other night because neal showed me the website. it said I was an ESTP? I think. anyway, part of it said that I would tell people what I think. I don't know how correct that is because I am usually the person with enough tact to not say mean things and well pretty much ALL my friends will say crap. Jill is the most tactless, when she and sean got together I was quite angry. and still when I think about it I get angry at her. why not at him? I don't get that. but when I typed his name I accidentally wrote sew. I am thinking about buying myself a sewing machine because I keep thinking of things. like today as I walked across campus I was thinking of different shirts and 'textiles' to make. I've wanted to do stuff like that for a while but I just. didn't. and now, even though I'm busy with papers to write etc, I really want to get creative. Lauren's sewing machine is here still but it didn't work very well. I can't remember how badly it ran but I should probably check that before I buy one. I don't know how much they'll cost either. I think $150 at walmart? but I don't want a plastic one. I'm sure I could break it and I'd rather have machinery than plastic. I think I should inheirit mom's old one and she can get a new one. but I said that once and she said no way. whatev. I'm tired. I tried to go to bed by midnight again but it ended up to be 130 I think. I don't remember exactly but 6 or less hours of sleep sucks. and I've been doing it for days. that's probably not good. another thing that's probably no bueno is that I HATE my job. and this isn't like the first year I worked at culvers and I was just a lazy bum. I am good at my job, I do it well, I used to enjoy serving customers. but now it has  been REALLY hard to make myself go. and its not like I'm just going to call in sick, I just don't want to go. I want to hit almost all of my coworkers, the guys that hit on me and our dumb new manager. I don't get why he thinks he can change everything right when he gets here without learning how the business works in the first place! and he's weirdly energetic. and since lauren and david have told me the same, I know I'm not the only one whos creeped out by it. well goodbye my 20 min were up a few sentences ago.

1900,"A lot of things to do. What is that smell? People keep talk to me while trying to finish this. what time is it? I have to finish my project before 5:00. Clicking of the keys. don't have time to finish everything. What is that beeping sound. Telephone ringing, someone answer the phone or stop calling. Maybe people just don't want to talk. You would think people would get the idea that no ones home after they let the phone ring 50 million times. Got to get to class. I don't care if the thing is wrong. I just need to be alone to finish my things. Mother walks in and out of the room. Josh keeps trying to find the cats. Can't hear what is happening on the TV in the other room. Candy, I want some. Don't eat them all. I haven't had one. how much longer do I have. Oh, it is also time for me to leave. 12  o'clock p. m. ""  Is that clock fast. Josh keeps walking up and down the hall. Sit still. Only a few more minutes. I need to call Emily back. It been a while since I talk to her. Have no time to talk. I hope she is not mad at me for it. We need to get together and do something. I need to finish that project if only this would go a little faster. That would nice if I could all my stuff in time. Time should just stand still and let me catch up with everything. That is so funny a poodle coat dyed pink. That must catch everyone's eye when they are walking on the street. Who would dye the dog coat a different actually I think I would but not  pink too showy.

838,"Ever since I can remember, I have always had my friends. There's my best friend, Lisa, and then my other best friends Lindsey and Lexie. Ever since I was a baby, we have always been friends. We have all gone to school together and now we are all attending the same college. Before I found out I had gotten a scholarship to UT, I had been planning to go to Texas A&M. Me and Lisa would go to A&M and Lindsey and Lex would go to UT. Just thinking about splitting up for the first time in our entire lives can still make tears come to my eyes. NOw I will never know how it would have been.   Sometimes I do wonder how it would have been and sometimes I don't care because I'm so happy to still be with them. I realize that they are such a great part of me and my life. We all know each other so well. There is hardly nothing about them that I don't know and there is nothing about me that they don't know. To even say that they are my best friends does not express how much they mean to me. They are more than just friends. I don't know why, but somtimes I can't help but think about how lucky I am to have them. And at the same time, I know I take them for granted. I know that if I ever need anything, anything at all, that I can go to them and they will help me in a way that no one else can. I once heard this poem that simply explains my relationship with my friends. The poem may not be word for word, but I hope it is can better describe just how much I love my friends. First there was one. Then there was two. You came along and then there was three. A circle of friends, no beginning, no end. ",1
1281,"I just set my alarm on the cell phone because I didn't want to over write or something. I'm listening to Fiona Apple's song. It's called Across the Universe, I think. I don't know if I was supposed to put quotations around the title of the song. Yes, I'm sure that's what I was supposed to do. This writing assignment is kind of weird cause I don't know what I'm supposed to be writing about and sometimes this freedom makes me kind of weird on the subject. Too much freedom isn't always comfortable, I guess. I can't stop thinking about how bad I feel that I didn't go to my philosophy class on Tuesday. It's not because the professor sucks. Or at least I don't think it is cause I know he does kind of not get the point across. He's too vague. too much vagueness and too much freedom. Both are not good especially if you want structure. I need structure in my life. I do because sometimes I think that I know what I'm doing and what I want to do but it just doesn't work out that way and I think it's because I just want things to be scheduled or I can't get them done. I don't' know how to structure my life, though. This song makes me so depressed even though I like it a lot. I don't know what to write about. I don't know if I'm supposed to continuously type, without stopping, or if I can stop to think about what I want to write about but not get away from the computer. I feel like my writing isn't quality writing here, but I guess that's the point of writing this. I've been writing for four minutes. I know. I stopped to look at the clock. I want to talk to my boyfriend. We got into a fight today because he was upset that I didn't call him and went over to a friend's dorm room. I know that's not what he's upset about though. I know it's because this friend of mine is a guy. I hate that he's so jealous like that. I mean, I don't mind if he wants to show me that he cares, but getting upset with me and hanging up with me like that, I just don't like. Especially embarrassing me in front of my friend. I've known my friend, Jonathan, longer than I have been with my boyfriend. I don't' know. I guess my boyfriend is just paranoid. I love him a lot though. I just wish we had what we had in the beginning of our relationship: blind love and trust. I don't know. I guess that once you go out with someone for so long, things just fly away and you're left with what you always thought you weren't going to do and be and say and feel. I understand why some women cry about their husbands beating them but yet they don't leave. It's called love with a condition. She loves him because she's been with him for so long. I'm thinking that maybe if I didn't type so fast, I wouldn't end up with too much for this writing assignment. First of all, I think this is the coolest writing assignment. Not only because we have this freedom, which I think can get a little demanding. I think it's neat because we can write what we think. It isn't an essay on the revolution of blah blah. It's what I feel and think and want to say, which is always nice, especially in writing. I'm used to doing this though I guess cause I write in my journal often. I never type though, so I guess I'm getting more said. And believe it or not, I always worry about space on my journal. Like, I worry that I'll ""waste"" too many spaces on only one entry. I think I'm so weird. I guess I do kind of like to keep things in order and not waste too much. I am like that in many ways I guess. But I'm also guessing it's a better trait to have than not. I don't know. My computer is making funny noises. I hate my computer cause I paid close to two thousand dollars for it and it doesn't even shut down properly. Plus, stupid Dell won't help me any. I write them and tell them of my technical problem and they just reply to my emails with dumb strategies that don't even work. I've already tried a million times. It makes me want to not fix it at all and just shut it down with the power surge adaptor under my desk. I miss home. I wish I could go home and be with my mom and not worry about money or food or weight. I'm gaining so much weight. I lost about ten pounds my senior year and everybody was complaining that I looked anorexic. Now that I'm in Austin, I've already gained those ten back and I'm scared that now I'll turn into too big of a girl, that ill be that girl, the bigger one than all the other girls. I was only maybe 110 pounds but because all of my friends weighed 90, I looked bigger. Maybe that's why they never wanted to go out with me. I don't know. Maybe it's cause I'm Korean, I don't look like most of the people where I'm from. The Rio Grande valley: either you're Mexican or some type of Mexican. Even the general white population was considered a minority there. Anyway but yeah I used to be cheerleader/student council president and all other kinds of stuff in junior high and I got to high school and cheerleading sucked because I was a freshman and everything else sucked. All my friends turned into druggies. About half of them went to rehab. I feel bad for them. But then again. I don't know. They're here at UT with me. Well, most of them. Does that mean I'm almost equivalent to a druggie? I've never done any drug besides drinking and smoking cigarettes and even that I don't do often. I wish I could find answers to some stupid questions that are so insignificant. Whatever. All I know is that I want my future to bright and successful. I actually want to write. I want to sit and write my poems and my thoughts and write a book, but I know that won't ever be possible. I wouldn't' be able to do it as my job, my career. I know I need food to eat and money to pay bills with and writing books, especially when you're barely starting off, won't get you too much on the table and in your pockets. I don't know. I wish I had the patience to go through medical school but I don't think I could, and besides, I suck at sciences. I would never be able to go through all those damn chemistry and biology classes. I would die. I really would. Why would I want to shoot so high for a career that will only bog me down with way too many hours? Actually, the guy I was talking about before, Jonathan, he has an uncle who is a doctor and he's so rich and makes his own hours, basically. He's working in the ER right now because he likes to travel, and ER doctors can usually go work at whatever hospital. I'm so tired. My shoulders hurt. My boyfriend is coming tomorrow to see me. I'm so excited. We've been going out for two years. It's like we're both from the valley and it's like I'm going to be able to see a part of the old me, at home. I haven't seen him for two weeks, which is nothing compared to the long separation periods when I was a senior in high school and he was a freshman up at A&M. yup, he's an aggie. Funny how I got to be a longhorn. I don't even have all that pride in being one. I didn't even look into buying a sports packet to go watch the game. I wish I was back to being my peppy self like I was in junior high. Did I kill myself? Or did I let other people kill me? Did I let other people tell me I wasn't good enough? I don't know. I want it to be 9:24 so I can stop writing. My shoulders hurt and my neck hurts. I feel too pressured doing this. But yet, I like this writing assignment. ",0
1566,"Somtimes I don't understand why people are the way they are. Why am I falling in love with a guy that I can't be with? I mean, my gah, we're perfect for each other other than the fact that he thinks I'm some sort of deluded tricked person who is believing wrong (referring to my religion). We're both stubborn in the aspect of our beliefs and aren't willing to compromise however there is this unnaturally strong bond, I guess you could say, between us. I don't know what to do. I want to be with him so bad, I really honestly and truly do however I'm afraid of getitng hurt again. Maybe I am delusional, maybe its because I'm afraid I can't get a guy here. Maybe I don't know what I believe or not. I question what I really want and often wonder why I choose to live the way I do. Why do I sacrifice happiness for the sake of morality? Something that would make me happy, why do I avoid it? Because I'm afraid that God will condemn me to hell. Yes, that must be it. I know I'm saved and that I will go to heaven however I feel that other people will condemn me, I will condemn myself and ultimately God will condemn me. Fear of man, fear of myself, fear of God, fear of doing what I want, fear of getting pregnant if I choose to have sex, all of these things cause me inner turmoil. Why be with a guy that's all the way up in New York and you're down in Texas? I love him, I want to be with him, but I'm denying my inner feelings somehow--I don't know 100% what I feel or how I feel it. . I don't know if I'm creating some sort of mental captivity for myself by not choosing to be with him--am I missing out on the best thing of my life?  He says all the right things, but does he truly mean what he says?  I guess only showing will prove it.   I do like this rose that he gave me. I mounted it on this background thing of New York City that I made. its a beautiful glass rose, but it broke in the mail. He was upset that it wasn't perfect however me and symbolism, I said it was better that it was broken because things aren't perfect, and even though it will be mended, it won't be perfect. And that's okay. Nothing is perfect. The rose is so beautiful. It offsets the background and the Statue of Liberty infront of it. I love New York. Do I love this guy because I love New York so much? Or do I love New York so much because I love this guy? Who knows? All I know is that its raining here, and I'm sitting alone in my dorm room, cold and alone. surrounded by the mass but alone in spirit. alone in body. alone. I think its stopped raining now, but I'm not sure if it will continue. I have no umbrella. I'm not prepared for the storm. Like life, huh? You can prepare yourself for everything except the most obvious--what happens if it rains? You prepare for the cold, you prepare for the wind, you prepare for the ice. . but the rain comes, and you have nothing. No umbrella, nothing. all you have is what you took with you. . your books, your clothes, your hand, the trees or a overhang of a building.   I came here to Austin not knowing anything. I mean I knew what I've heard but I didn't actually know. I now know, and I don't know what to think. The mass is around me but I'm alone. . alone, cold standing in the rain with no umbrella. dreaming about the distance, and longing for the closeness.   I've thought about becoming a psychologist. . However I don't know if I want to abandon business. I don't know what I want to do really. I mean, I know certain things I like however I don't know what I want to do with what I like. I like many things but I love little. I've always helped people with their problems, listened to their issues, offered my advice when prompted. maybe its time I get paid for it, lol. . I wrote in my notebook about becoming a psychology professor--that way I can interact with students, be in authority and teach about psychology. but I don't know if I want to do that. . Why wouldn't I want to? Money, travelling, I don't know to be honest.   Wow, ten minutes and I've typed a novel. . Omg, I feel for the individual who has to read this, lol. I guess its a curse from typing since like the 4th grade. I think I can get up to like 100 words a minute now. . I was talking to this one guy online however I told him I would   brb in 20  . He has a crush on me. I don't like him. I know its for superficial reasons, but I don't wish to get in an internet relationship, lol. Yeah it would end up being an internet relationship. and I'm not about to go down that road, lol. . The first and ONLY one was this one guy who ended up being a clingy-blood-craving-dog-collar-wearing-submissive ex-goth who liked to bite people. Strange, eh? Weird guys fall for me, lol. One guy. . omg, the state hospital patient--He hit on me while I was volunteering there for bingo, omg. that was scary, haha. Then there was the drunk guy who said I was Miss America 2002--poor kid, lol. . Then, let's see. . the ex goth, the state hospital guy, the drunk dude. Hmm, I know there's more. . Ahh yes, boyfriend number one. The sex-craving chain smoker who was like 5 inches shorter than me. I learned from this guy to ALWAYS tell your mother about your relationships. That stupid dork called my house at midnight and was saying nasty things to my mother thinking it was me, lol. I came home and my door was off the hinges, my tv, stereo and phone were out and she changed the dead bolts on my door. THEN we proceeded to go to the health  clinic where I got the hepatitus A series vaccine (which is good to have anyways lol) and was threatened to get tested for AIDs. It was a traumatic experience, lol. Darn those junior high days lol. .   Well I have less than five minutes left and have managed to go thru most all of my relationships. LoL, wow, the more I remember them, the funnier they get. . my friends think they're hilarious lol. But one thing I've learned--I can't please everyone. I guess I have to live for myself and that's about it. Though I have religion and the morals that   confine   me with that--it should be done out of love. . but right now I don't have love. I want love to give to God, but I'm so caught up in what I want and the inner turmoil that its causing me to just want happiness with this guy, I managed to squeeze out love or desire to grow with God more. . Yes, it hurts to say it, and to acknowledge it. . but hey, I guess its the truth? I guess that's why this was the first assignment--so we can see what we really think and feel. . to write them out and to put them on the table so we can look at what we feel and not deny that we truly did think what we thought. Hmm. two and a half minutes left. .   I think I want to skip class. . lol, I'll go though. . I just hope I don't get rained on. A perfect ending to a perfect essay. . with one exception. Perfection doesn't exist. Morality doesn't want to exist. And I don't know where to find an umbrella.   In the last few seconds or minutes or whatever, my mind wonders to the pasta I had for lunch. NO clue as to why, lol, however I do like pasta. I wonder what I'll have for dinner. Wow, this writing went from super deep to super light, topic wise lol. . Grr, I got the Trojan and Mimic virus on my computer. . another lovely addition to another lovely day. Time is up and I have class to go to. Its been nice writing. . Maybe I'll do this again. . Typing of course--I can type faster than I can handwrite, lol. 3. 2. 1. Times up. . Ohh, I can continue writing. Well, I can't now. I have psychology class. ",1
1741,"     I cannot believe that I am finally in college at the University of Texas, living the college life is such a tremendous change from the life that I have previously been living. Before I moved to college I lived with my mother, my father, and my younger brother Jeremy. Also living with us was our many many animlas, whom over the years grew and other times shrunk. My all time favorite however would have to be my cat Magic, whom i was very upset to leave. Magic has been my cat for about 13 years now, and he has been there though so much. Good times and bad times. The happy and the sad. More recently, about a two years ago, we had a new addition to our home. My dog Rocky, who I miss incredibly. I never thought that I would get so attached to an animal, much less a dog, becuase dogs never were my favorite pets. In fact I never really cared for dogs. But however it happened, it happened. I am totally infactuated with my dog Rocky. I would take him everywhere with me if I could. It is so hard to be at college and away from him. It is almost like he is my son or something,I often feel the need to dicspline him, and however it happens, I find myself talking to him. I anxiously await the holidays that I get to go home to see him. However, even more than my cat magic, my dog Rocky, I miss my dad. My dad has always been the most important person adn thing in my life, for as long as I can remember, I have always looked up to my dad, admired my dad, and wanted to be just like my dad. I can't stand to part from him. We have been more than just father and daugther, we have been best friends. We hung out together, laughed together and cried together. I could always trust him and tell him everything, as I still can. He always believed in me and had the most faith in me, and most important he always trusted me and my judgment. I was the one who always cooked for my dad, and ran arrands for him. I would do anything at the drop of a dime for my dad, as he would do for me. It has been hard moving to college and being away from him. I talk to him everyday, but its almost like i don't know what to say. I hate the fact that I am missing out on whats going on in his life, and he is not here to see whats going on in mine,  It just not the same hearing it over that phone. I no longer know where he is at every second, and its a hard change. I am happy to be growing upp and moving on with my life, but i don't want things to change between my dad and i. It hard because the more i grow, the less i need him, and i like that i need him, and that he needs me. Although it is hard being away form my dad, and the rest of m family, it makes the move and change so much easier having my boyfriend of 9 months, here at college experiencing the change with me. He lives in the same dorm as me (university towers) on the same floor just down the hall. It nice to have someone who i love so much be here to support me. We are lucky to have all the same classes and schedule so we always have a familiar face a around. we spend all of our time together, which i love. Every morning I make him breakfast ( i love to cook)  before we go to class. I actually cook every single meal every day for him. But i love it. Its like we are married which lots of people may not think is a good thing at this age, but its perfect. I love him so much, and he is a wonderful guy. OUr parents have become best friends in the time we have been dating. Our paretns are even going to Hawaii this winter togetrher. This summer, Paul and I (my boyfriends name is Paul) went to Europe together,  it was the graduation present to us from our parents. It was an incredible vacation and expereince. I had the time of my life. We went to Lonodon, and a few places in France. . . Nice, Cannes, St. Paul, adn my favorite Paris. I love the shopping. My parents love Paul and as far as I know his parents love me. It is the perfect relationshop and hopefully one day will be the perfect marriage, I know its a long way off, but hopefully not to long. I know that we can be together forever, however if things change, I will be okay to, I am always ready for change although I don't really like it too much. Its hard that we have still so much to go through being as this is just the beginning of our college lives, I hope that we can make it through it together. I have to work on not being so jeolous and controlling, and really just going with the flow. I don't always have to have things planned, and if he doesnt want to do things with me, i have to be okay with that. I am working on builing my own life separate from his and then i can improve my life with him. I am so anxious to start my life and be with him forever that i forget sometimes that i am only in college and a lot can change in the next four years. I am looking foward to the next four years. I just got in to the sorority of my choice (AEPhi). hOwever i am not even sure whether or not i definitely want to be in the sorority, i am not sure if it is really my thing or not. i am happy with my boyfriend, not looking for new guys, and i have never been the type to have a lot of close girlfriends, i think it may be good for me to associate more with girls. so i am going for it. if i change my mind i can always drop out later. well tomorrow is our first sorority party it is the Phi Tie party, Paul is going to come with me, I guess i will see more how i feel about this whole sorority thing tomorrow, well i have to go, my time is up.

1043,"Just got home in Houston. It's a 2 and a half hour drive. Thought everything is just going to be fine when suddenly a lady who pulled her car behind me bumped into the back bumper of my car. I pulled to the side and got out of the car. She got out too and I looked at my bumper just a few scratches. I let her go. I am in a hurry! I have a doctors appointment at 4pm and there is no time to waste not to mention this writing assignment is due at 5pm. there goes my afternoon! This is been a busy week and a depressing one. I knew I was going to see Jenn at the CSA meeting but somehow I knew even though I didn't want to see her. I still ended up saying hi to her. What is wrong with me!?!?! I should have just skipped it. I should have also not forced Rona to go into the CSA meeting room. I think she got a little mad at me. I didn't really care. She said she saw Henry and she doesn't want to go in there and let him see her. She is afraid that he would say something to Shawn or Eugene or those dumb losers. Even though they were my high school friends, I still think Shawn has changed. Well people change. What can I say? I changed for the worst. Does anyone change for the best???? Sometimes I wish I would have made some choices that are good and the outcome would be better. But I end up making the bad ones that I am regretting. Oh well. my friend Chris is messaging me again on I'M maybe it's time to go. Mom is coughing I hope she is ok. She said she is sick because of the car accident. I wonder how bad it was. It was my fault. I shouldn't have left so early that afternoon so they had to take my brother back to Austin. You see another bad choice of mine. What can I say!?!?!. I am speechless really want to change radically. Stop smoking stop procrastinating daydreaming live for the present??? ",0
374,"I thought I could cry forever and I wanted to until I feel eased and better. I guess that made me feel at least somewhat better since I don't feel as depressed or sad right now. I saw mo and ricky this morning. mo probably thinks I've gotton weird, edged, or I don't know, just crazy and there's something wrong with  me. yeah. there's definitely something wrong with  me. I wanted to talk to him so much. I miss him so much when I don't see him and I don't see him as much or at least I don't try as much to see him or hang out with  him. before hanging out with  him was one of my better comfort or pleasure, but it hurts me now to him. he is, to me, one of my best friend and I care for him a lot. I want the best for him and he doesn't deserve a person like me. I am so confused. I am so depressed. I know that I should talk to people about it but it isn't so easy after all. connie doesn't understand or I know understand her. I tried so hard for her but she seems so insensitive or she is being a jerk on purpose to be insensitive to me. I don't even think she knows what she's doning to me. God please help me to get through this time. I truly believe that only you could help me and pull me through this misery. I miss feeling your awesome love. I feel so lonely. I feel bad but I can't really talk to my mom about this my whole crazy situation. she expects so much out me. she loves me so much that it hurts her so much to see me being like this. but Lord, I really don't know what I can do. I don't think I am capable of doing anything well or at least I don't have any desire to do anything. I thought mom was okay with  elementary education and I thought I could do that, but she says, ""no, no!"" to it. what can I do?  I really want to be the daughter my parents want me to be. I really want to be a friend all my other friends want me to be. I really want to be a sister sungmin and sungchan want me to be. but most of all, I really really want to be someone that I want to be that will please everyone and the most of all You. I am so confused. Lord I don't know what to do and this makes me a sad, depressed and unhappy person. I don't have any motivation to do anything and this is so hard because the school has already started. whenever I feel like I want to cry or feel down I want to go to certain people like timmy, steve, mo, betty, connie, mom, and etc. but timmy, as much as I want to go to him, I can't for some reason. instead, I'm so mean to him. I don't mean to be. I hope he knows it. I wonder if he still likes me. I sometimes feel like he does, but I don't think so anymore. guys are so frickle. steve. I want to but I can't depend on him too much because he will be married soon and I shouldn't be near him so much. mo. I want to but you are one of my problems. why can't you be just a friend to me. betty and connie. I shouldn't talk to them so much, in fact, I kind of regret telling them so much about me. I shouldn't have. oh well, they are my friends and I hope they don't ruin my trust on them. well, I feel so much better just writing about everyting or most of the things that bothered me for so long. I guess my 20 minutes are up. maybe things will be better today. ",0
2381,"So, I can now finally begin this writing. I am pretty relaxed right now because I have a wonderful boyfriend. He is funny, sweet, and weird like I am. I feel like I am writing in a journal. Trying to track my thoughts is weird because I feel like I jump from one idea to the next really quickly. It is almost as if I am ADD in the mind. That sounds weird. I keep hearing this ticking from this tiny pink watch that is sitting right next to me. It surprises me how loud it ticks for being a wrist watch. Now, I can hear the television from the living room. It sounds pretty interesting. I can hear the air condition vent outside the apartment complex. The air just turned off now but the vent is as loud as can be. I like the noise of the keyboard when I type. Especially when I type fast. The clicks make me think that I am really accomplishing something. I am going to stop talking about sounds now and try to see what my mind is does. Write now I am a little tired. My brain seems a little slow right now. I feel a little overwhelmed by the school work load along with my sorority obligations and my job. I am happy thinking about my sorority. I love the girls! Everyone of them make me feel important ant that I really matter. All the girls are so fun to be around too. We all love to go out to parties and dance. Man, that car outside that just passed through was very loud. The music was rap and not very good. I do not understand sometimes why people ride around at night with really loud music and their windows down for everyone to hear. It seems kind of dumb to me that it is a week day night and there are people out there thinking they are all cool. Man this watch ticking is really bothering me. It's amazing how many things I hear when I really think about things. This means I am not talking which is a really good accomplishment for me. I love to be social and visit with everyone. I just remembered that I am missing music. Normally, when I type or do any homework I like to listen to some music. When I do math, I can listen to any kind of music I want. But if I have a paper or any readings, I can only listen to classical music. Speaking of music, I had my first T. A. session for my History of Rock class. It was really interesting. The teacher is pretty cool and nice. We get to listen to all kinds of music every class. The only thing is it seemed to me like I was learning all about how music works again like as if I was in band all over again. Man, I keep looking at the clock and just realized that my twenty minutes is almost up. I remember looking at seven minutes thinking that this was going to be a long twenty minutes. I was wrong. I am almost done and it went by so fast. My stomach doesn't feel too well. I think I ate too much marshmallows. Also, my head hurts now. Maybe I just didn't eat enough today. I only have          ",0
1765,"Am not in the best of moods right now. I have something bothering me at this time. But I take my mind of my problems by thinking of happier times or doing my homework. I am worried about some really personal problem which is killing me inside.  However, life goes on. Am good now, or at least not feeling so down. This is my first homework am doing ever since the weekend. Sounds really bad, but I console myself by having it in my mind that, am better off than many others.   AT this very moment Am listening to music while typing. I really like music, it gives me a peace of mind, makeing me feel better. And it always reminds me that, life is what you make of it. If you make it sad, your life is going to be sad and vice versa. I always try to think positively, that helps the mind grow.   I decided to do my assignment now, because I was feeling down ever since last night, and because this is all the time I will have. So if I don't do it now, I`ll probably not have sufficient time.   Guess what! Life in college is very stressing, so I always try to keep a huge distance from the college stress. I always thought that I was too young to get stressed out but now its happening to me. But hey, life must go on, so I am trying to make the best of it, even in times of stress.   I like my life right now, I really don't regret doing any of the wrong things in my past because, I know that they all came a long way to make me a better person, what I am today is a result of my ups and downs so far in my life.    I don`t type that very well, so there will be I hope not too many errors. Life is one of the best things we have. We can and should always try to make an impact in the lifes of others- a GOOD impact.     ",1
2098,what should I write about? I wish that I was not so slow at typing. I wonder how long I have typed for . man I haven't typed that long only 1 minute and 39 seconds.

297,"I went to my sorority's crush party last night. I didn't really know what to expect because they had it at Buffalo Club and I don't dance, I don't smoke, and I certainly don't look 21. At any rate, I wasn't having very much fun after 30 minutes. At that point a guy came up to me and asked me to dance, I figured it couldn't be any worse than standing around so I said yes. We ended up hanging around with each other the entire evening. We exchanged phone numbers and I kind of figured that was the end of it. It was about twelve-thirty when I drank half of my ""big sister's"" Long Island Iced Tea and I have to say I think that it really impaired my judgement. I got talked into going to Dance Across with three of my sorority sisters and the guy who had been hanging around me. I had fun, we danced, but he isn't exactly the kind of guy I'm particularly attracted to. For some reason I put that aside, became extremely flirtatious, and even let him French kiss me after having met him only four hours before. I feel really cheap now, I never do things like that. I don't really know what the reason for my actions was (I'm blaming it on the drink, but that's probably not the problem because the effects had worn off before the end of the evening). Maybe I'm somewhat lonely, it's been about three months since I've had a boyfriend. The problem is that I woke up this morning and regretted last night. I feel like I used this guy, I didn't mean to. Maybe it's not that I don't want a boyfriend, maybe it's that I don't want him as a boyfriend. The worst thing about this is that I've been in his position before (having someone kiss me than decide they don't want me, in fact, it was last week) but it hurt my feelings and I think it's extremely insensitive of me to do the same thing to someone else.

598,"I don't know if anyone will read this or not. Right now I have a huge headache from that survey. Some of those questions are ridiculous. I am not sure how many people are scared of sleeping dogs. Anyway, the ""gay"" questions really made me think. All of my friends tell me that it is a sin because the Bible says it is. So I think I answered that question how they would of and not me. But I do feel that a gay couple should NOT be able to adopt a child. What kind of life is that? The child would endure unnecessary criticism. My boyfriend lives in Oklahoma. I miss him so much. It is hard to watch everyone else be happy together. My suitemate is constantly with her guy. Basically I am jealous. I don't know why. I never considered myself a jealous person. Sitting here talking about relationships, makes me want to call him. My phone bill this month is going to be out of control. My parents are going to kill me. School- I am kind of worried about the whole thing. I never had to try that hard in high school and I was in the top 10%. but everyone at Texas is somewhat smart or they wouldn't be here. I heard that Texas had to accept around 3,000 freshman that were in the top 10%. I was at the bottom of that spectrum. I wish it would be 20 min. already. I am so tried. I have large amounts of homework to do today. As I sit here there are lots of people passing in church outfits. I feel guilty that I didn't go this morning. At home (Houston) my family went every Sunday at 7:30. My mom is weird. Why would you go at 7:30 when you could go at 9:30, 10:45, or 12:30. She makes me so mad sometimes. Last night we got in this fight over plane tickets to Oklahoma. My boyfriend and I were going to split the price but she wants him to pay since his family has millions. She is such a snob. I never understood why though. Actually I am surrounded by a lot all the time. I just finished ""rushing"". What an experience!  I am so glad it is over. My time is almost up. I can't wait to stop typing. My eyes hurt and I still have that headache. I complain way to much. Alright bye.  ",1
1430,"What I feel is that I have disappointed myself so far this semester. I planned on being so much more organized than I actually am. I look around my room and my desk and get really annoyed at myself. I think I am missing something in terms of college academic life. I feel that I should be stressed and overwhelmed because those have been my feelings for the past couple of years. In high school, I was always trying to outdo myself and get more involved. By the time my senior year came around, I was so involved in clubs and classes that I was burnt out before 1st semester was even over. Every class I took was based on the recommended courses for UT. Every club I joined was so I could put several different activities on my application. Now that I am in college, I wonder if I am serious about my major, Theatre and Dance. Don't get me wrong, I love performing, and in an ideal world, I would become a regular on Broadway. But I always secondguess my goals and the reality of them actually coming true. I have performed literally since I could walk and talk. I haven't appeared on any major stages or on television, but performing has always been a really significant part of my life. It has shaped me into the person I am now. I just keep thinking. ""is this really feasible or not. "" It is one of the few things that I am good at and have been successful in. I suppose I went into the College of Fine Arts because fine arts are so familiar and comfortable for me. I actually thought of becoming a clinical psychologist or a social worker for the latter part of my high school life; I even took a semester of psychology last year. But I came to this conclusion: I have too many problems of my own that I can barely deal with, so how on earth could I solve anyone else's problems? The answer: I could not. I don't know. I guess I will get more into the routine as the weeks roll by. Hopefully, I will be successful at UT. Time can only tell. ",0
99,"I have never used Julie's computer before. It's kind of weird. I don't  like the font being used on this computer. I wish there was a way I could  change it. I am also very irritated that I am still on the same line that  I started on. Maybe if I press enter it will start a new line. There you go. Much better. I am kind of tempted to use this fan connected  on the  desk here, even though I am not hot. I just feel like using it. Alison is funny. We keep writing each other email even though we could be sitting right next to each other. Carrie is coming to visit tomorrow. I am so excited. Chris said that he might come the next weekend. I am in love with Chris. He has no idea though. I wish I could tell him, but I know that he does not feel  the same way. He is always talking about how picky he is. I am certainly  not his type. God I wish I was. I told him that one day I would be perfect for him. Sigh. I can't wait to see him. I keep thinking of my exboyfriend. He has to be the biggest jerk known to man. The problem is that I don't think of the bad stuff, only the good. Ok, this is driving me crazy. I don't know how this page has been arranged, but I don't like it . ARGH!  Someone just  died in Carries dorm last night. It sounds horrible. I would be so scared if someone down the hall from me was killed. I've got ten minutes to go. I  can dig it. I don't really like Amber. She gross. Smokes too much. I don't smoke that often. Julie just found one of Jason's hidden cigs. It was funny. He was all saying, I've never seen that before. He's cute. Today's his  birthday. I haven't gotten him a present yet, although I know what I'm gonna get  him. I'm sleepy. I almost feel asleep in biology. Someone did and Billie put the spotlight on them. I wonder what someone reading this would be thinking right now. Who the hell is Billie probably. That would be an interesting  job. Reading all the submissions. People's minds are fascinating. I wish I c could read people's minds. Thoughts are cool. You know most of the time  people are really thinking about sex or something else taboo. Actually, I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t really know if that's true, but I've read statistics. I don't think  about sex all the time, but I do often remember kisses, or picture myself  kissing someone. I hope that's normal. Kissing is so romantic. It can  mean so much. How depressing it is to not have someone to kiss. I often  feel sorry for myself. I don't think that's wrong. My sister just walked in. I was kind of worried that she would see what I was writing. Is that wrong, to be writing about kissing. It is kind of personal. I'm thinking about  dogs now. They are so cute. I really love baby animals. I can't wait to  live in an apartment or house where I can own a mutt. I'd like to own a dog with Chris someday. I think it would scare him if he knew how much I thought  about him. I don't know if I really am in love with him, but I often think I  am. If only I could be forty pounds lighter. I had planned on losing five pounds a month. I haven't checked since moving to Austin. I don't think IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve lost any weight though. I tend to eat a lot of cafeteria food. We are  going out to dinner to night. I need to ask Julie if she has a scale so that  I can weigh myself. I wasn't to sure I wanted to go. It's with J and J and  friends I don't know. I hope I get along well with everyone. I wonder if my train of thought that I'm typing is a good representation of how I really think. Wow, I've written for 24 minutes now. Those last ten minutes flew by. My hand hurts now so I guess I'll stop. I feel as though I should thank you  for listening. Thanks         ",0
1357,"ahhhh. I can't take it anymore, living with Erik. I seriously don't understand what we are. Well, actually I think I do but just won't admit it. We're friends with benefits, that's terrible. We sleep in the same bed every night, and we cuddle, I rub he's back every night before I go to bed, and then he turns over and I rub his chest and stomach, and every morning his arm is around me. But every time I go to bed I always remind myself to stay far away from him as possible on the bed. like I always try to have my back facing him, but sometimes I can't help especially since his place is always so cold. I feel terrible that denniele has to sleep on the floor, and sometimes yeah erik and I will do it when she's only a few feet away. The thing is erik and I are really good in bed, but its more than that. It's really hard to get over someone when you're living with them, I want to move on I really do, I just I still like Erik. our relationship is really weird though, I mean he still has the picture of him and I out on his bed stand, and he'll do these cute little favors, why?! Why are men so difficult to understand? They want one thing, but do another, its like shit make your mind. They say we play games whatever. D and I just need to move out of there, but how can we when we can't even get approve for an apartment, we were suppose to move out like 2 weeks ago, but didn't get approve. It's really nice of Erik, my exboyfriend to let us stay at his place. D still doesn't have a job, but she's going through all these problems, she's so depressed and I'm really glad she's finally seeking help for it. The position she's in must be really difficult especially with me and Erik around. The other night, his exfiance called from Florida I know it was her it had to be. Well, since I did read his mail, and she's trying to find him, and the girl in the photograph who's half naked in his drawer is his ex he just won't admit to me. Ahhh. he's an asshole, but I still want him, why because as much as we don't want to admit, girls like the asshole because it's much more exciting there's a chase. But when a good guy comes you don't want him, strange huh. Anyways, D and I just need to meet new people that's all, but where? Seriously, where do we find new guys, not 6th street that's the worse place to go to. Shit I know he's out there somewhere, I shouldn't even be worrying about this stuff, there's so much I'm going through, with school and work, all this pressure I don't know even I can handle it. I'm really afraid of what the future holds for me. I really miss my family I haven't been home since spring break and I haven't seen my family since June, it's terrible that I didn't even go home at all this summer, I guess the reason I stayed was because of Erik. Erik was my first boyfriend, but not my first sexual partner, I was raped. He's so adorable, ahhh! I still remember our first conversation and the first times we went out and dated, ahhh! Oh, goodness I saw Ian last weekend, well he gained weight, and now has a girlfriend, good for him as long as he is happy then I am happy for him. I've always wanted to know what would have happened if I had told him how I felt about him. But then I met Erik, so who knows. I am so behind in all my classes, I've barely read for anything which is terrible. I just can't study at home at all, I get so distracted with Erik and D being there. I am so indebt right now, I owe all these institutions money. Because of my irresponsibility that's why. Oh well, I know everything will be okay. I feel so fat I'm 137, right now I want to be at least 125, agrrrr. patience I'll be there, I just haven't had the time though to go down to gregory to workout. It's really just my tummy that's big, I still can't believe I got my belly button pierced last week, heheheh. I'm working today and the next two days, I need to make some mad money. Whatever happens happens, right. I wonder how my papa is doing where is he, somewhere on the road probably. I hope my dad and my sister are talking to each other, it's really hard when you have two daughters and one is always and the other one barely talks to you. I hope my mother is okay, I'm sure she is. Oh anyways, D's parents oh I love them they have helped me so much and guided me through a lot. The last few nights have been really fun, sitting outside with D for hours and just talking we haven't done that in a long time. I guess living with Erik though we have no privacy what so ever, she doesn't either. I hope she finds someone good, she's good person who deserves someone that will treat her right. OH and her brother deserves someone good as well, goodness I had the biggest crush over him this summer and Kenneth, too again. I saw Kenneth the other day, still so cute. But he's just so good, he doesn't deserve someone like me, trust me. What's up with Michie, I miss her I haven't spoken to her in like a month, how is she doing medically. HMmm! I really need to go home to Houston and visit everyone I actually need a break from Austin, I think I guess I'm just afraid to leave D and Erik alone in the apt. , its so sad that I don't even trust them together. I know I don't I've never trusted Erik, and I don't think he ever trusted me from the beginning and maybe that's why our relationship didn't work. He knew that I used to have feelings for Kenneth, and yet I hung out with the dude probably more than I did with Erik this summer. hmmm like I said I need to find fresh meat. ehehehe ",0
2081,"Okay so now I am sitting here preparing to write a stream of consciousness writing. I wonder why I have to type that out what am I thinking of course this is what I am going to write        this music that I am listening to seems to be distracting me a little and the timer I feel very stressed out writing to a real timer I don't know why        I think I will take off my head phones    I had planned to write about a lot but for some reason I can't seem to do more than   write what my head is thinking about    for one is my head supposed to blank out like it just did I guess I can start by describing my environment lets see    the air smells like air    the back of my back is warm from the sun through the window    right now there isn't any noises and I feel somewhat stressed and anxious    the timer keeps going coldly, without a thought to whether or not I actually have a though or not and I think the seconds are scrolling faster than a real second would. maybe my perception of time is defunct    if it were possible to qualify a sigh in thought-form my mind would have just sighed    I can't believe I have to go pick up my friend later today because his car broke down, its like I have to help him but I fear that he may not help me when the same situation like this occurs to me    I just woke up and for some reason there's a sense of dread weighing down on my heart    as if I feared that I am doing this stream of consciousness writing incorrectly    I can't believe I have already written for 5 minutes, time really does pass quickly when you are trying to listen in on your own inner thoughts    but it seems as if my thoughts are triggered by what I am doing, like I cannot seem to get into any deep right now such as the existence or nonexistence of god which I was arguing quite magnificently the other day but instead here I am babbling like my mind is a stream of babble instead of consciousness and I wonder if I am supposed to be aware that any of this is supposed to make sense I really hope it does because if it doesn't well I guess my mind is simply disorganized    but isn't that what a mind should be? disorganized? don't we need to take time to listen to our minds and organize the stream before we talk? its like the old saying, think before you speak and etc etc etc. if this is how my mind really thinks, I really think I cannot type fast enough to fully express the words in my mind. that is an interesting though, do I actually hear a voice in my head right now dictating everything I've just written? that is really weird, is this how our sense of hearing works? I have my own voice in my head only it doesn't have the auditory quality of my own voice, but rather I can hear it, its a strange process         I guess I really can't multitask when I am writing a stream of consciousness I see three ims on the bottom of this screen, all blinking yet unanswered        perhaps I am not truly tracking my own mind I MUST DWELL FURTHER IN. I'd like to reveal something about myself perhaps something I didn't know existed        I remember my childhood I don't know why but for some reason I start remembering it whenever I think too hard that or I am just trying to find something to say for this stream of consciousness either way . the phone is ringing, should I go pick it up? maybe I will just let my parents handle it, but it keeps ringing and ringing and ringing. looks like I had to pick it up for a bit, I hope the professor doesn't penalize me for 20 seconds of non thought but I can make up for it because it was my friend who I needed to help out today, he sounded pretty appreciative though I dismissed him quickly because of this assignment and here I am fixing mistakes in my typing        maybe I should just leave my mistakes in so I can listen to myself more. right well now I feel nostalgic or actually no I don't I just see a blue sky in my thoughts and clear. no with white clouds and its a clear day and I was a little boy there's a feeling that is not quite nostalgia but it permeates through me likes a majestic feeling as if I were over a cliff and viewing the world for the first time, its breathtaking. another thought sigh. I miss my childhood and here I am back behind my computer again full of stress and anxiety. I would view myself as a logical person not to get emotionalized (if that is a word) which it is not a word but I guess its the only way my thoughts can process it without me actually thinking about  it, yeah I make up a lot of words in my thoughts actually its quite strange why does it seem so hard to write about my stream but when actually I have written so much    originally I had planned to write a debate that was in my head about god but I guess that was yesterday night when I was heated up about it today I just feel complacent about writing about nothing. I see nothing revealing in the past couple of paragraphs, just a jumble of words broken thoughts and now I feel disappointed        why am I disappointed? I guess I just thought I could find something that could prove that I am more than just a regular case or is this stuff that I write even regular to all people? I don't know but I like being special. well no. now I feel embarrassed for writing that out and there's only 3 more minutes to describe the rest of my thoughts for today. its weird how if focused my thoughts do not go much into the future, I can't really plan ahead, I can't think about my future, my ambitions seem to fade away I guess this is the nature of this exercise that causes it since you are supposed to write at present thoughts which tend to mold my thoughts into present thoughts and I don't know why that past thought had blurbed into my mind perhaps I forced it to just for some interest in this stream of consciousness, why am I so eager to put interest in this bit, I do like this interface though what that has nothing to do with what I just said god. now I am frustrated at the fact that my mind is so disorganized that or if I tried to organize it I would have nothing to say it is so hard to just spew everything out the way that I think it because my preliminary thought is to first organize it and that takes so much time and for some reason sometimes I end up saying nothing because I dunno I know I obviously have a stream now but I guess since none of it makes much sense I can't really phrase it into communicable words or rather perhaps I am just afraid that if I do people will laugh at me for being an idiot. 8 more seconds. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. bye     ",1
1204,"What should I write for this assignment. If I write what I'm thinking at this moment a lot of people's feelings could be hurt and I really don't care to share these thoughts with a faculty that I know nothing about. My mother is approaching me, maybe she wants to talk with me. No, she stopped short at her purse. No, wait, she's coming over here. She asks me a question about my homework, something trivial. I don't think she can read my handwriting even though she's sitting right next to me and that's good because I wouldn't want here to read this piece of writing. Wait, she is reading it! I quickly lift up the pages to take them out of her line of sight. It's cold in this room, but it's only cold on one side. O course, it feels that way because I'm sitting beside a vent. It's so weird to sleep on the sofa, people can be replaced so easily! I've watched two people accomplish the task with much agility. Funny, I wish I could type fast enough to keep up with my thoughts, but they fly by too quickly. I wish this person in the room with me would ask me where I live, I think the answer would surprise her. What's the time, 10:40? I've gone over my time limit. How should I end this entry, would goodbye be appropriate? ",1
529,"I'm sorry, but I just don't where people get the sensation to steel something and have no doubts or submission about it. Where does that come from?  What, is it inherited, or something?  Do people just walk around, asking themselves what they can do to make someone feel like hell?  I just don't understand how people acquire such moral standings?    I can't wait until it's my birthday. I can finally watch Titanic in the privacy of my own home. over and over again. Leo. over and over again. three and one-half hours of pure Leo. Ahhhh, pure heaven. I wonder how people like him handle their lives. I mean, I don't know what I would do with all the fame and fortune; everyone admiring and watching me. My life would change so much; I'm not sure if I would like it very much. I hate the media. They make so much out of the stupidest things. Why would anyone live on making up cruel and misleading stories up for money?  It just boggles my mind. It's just like those people who the government pays bookooes of money to count how many ""Smiths"" there are in the world. O. K. So, maybe not that specific job, but something just as if not more silly. Seriously, though, the media stalks you and just waits for you to stumble so they can take that one incident and twist it all around, and spit it out at people to get their ratings lifted, or their sales up. And, people (the audiences) actually feed on this. Hell, even I do sometimes. All those sleazy magazines that say stuff like ""see the first pictures of the boy who was born with 20 arms and 5 eyes. ""  Crazy stuff like that. It's ridiculous. But, I must admit it is pretty humorous at times. I know when I'm in the grocery line, I browse over the titles just to get a laugh. I can't believe it's already 4:30. Where did the day go?  Why is it that, when you get older, the time goes faster. It's not like it's necessarily the fact that you're doing more than when you were younger, so the ""time flies when you're having fun"" does not necessarily pertain. Well, I guess it could. I don't know. All I know is that even when I'm not doing much, the days go by faster. That kind of scares me in a way. I have so much I want to do with my life, and what if one day I wake up and realize I haven't done a thing. I mean, what if I went to the doctor today, and they told me I only had 3 weeks to live?  Then, what would I do. I wouldn't have the time or energy to do everything that I've always dreamed of. I wouldn't meet the man I am destined to meet and fall madly in love with. Three weeks isn't even enough to get to know someone really well. That's awful when people find out something like that. I couldn't even imagine what my reaction would be. I still remember when my uncle supposedly only had 3 months to live, and he lived 2 years before he died. But, can you imagine how painful and nerve racking that would be, not knowing if you were going to wake up the next morning?  I remember the last time he went to the doctor's. He sat in his office, waiting for the results to tell him approximately how much longer he had. First of all, how can any one approximate someone's life?  But, he sat there and listened while the doctor told him he might live another 6 months to a year. He just shook his head, and said ""no. That's not going to happen. ""  He said his good-byes to all the staff at the hospital, went home, fell asleep, and never woke up again. ",1
1321,"trying to track how my mind works. I have so many different things going on in my head right now. mainly worries. I have so much to do and it seems like so little time. the scholarship, the basta website, the volunteer tutoring thing. I don't know if I'll be able to finish everything. I feel so drained, so tired. oh well. nothing is as it seems. blah, I feel like I need to just stand in a field and scream at the top of my lungs and let all this worry all this frustration everything that is inside me just come out. maybe then I can relax. I worry too much occupy my mind with so many different things I sometimes feel like my head is going to explode. ay diosito santo que vida. yawn. I feel like I need a vacation. a six month vacation away from everything. no classes, no relationship problems. or I should say breakup. I know that this is part of the problem. I've spent three years with adrian and now from one day to the next he wants things to be over. because he's not sure how he feels. we survived a year in a long distance relationship and now nothing. oh well. not much you can do. I feel sad. lonely overwhelmed at times. but I have good days. days when I feel like I could go on forever just plowing through the week the months the year until I finish my program. then what after that. I feel like I don't have a direction. I have a ba, worked as a teacher in ny for a year, now back in school to finish a certificate program. but then what I want to go to grad school, to law school maybe, but when. what if I don't make it then what. I have no plan. I feel like I just am trying to figure out what I need or want to do. who am I really. what am I going to do. I need a good day of just sleep. that would be really nice right about now. a day of sleep, of rest with no interruptions, no worries just sleeping. I don't even want to dream. just that kind of dead to the world thing. no time though. too much to do too many things going on. deadlines and commitments and work and school and everything in between. gosh I've been rambling, but not saying much really. stream of consciousness assignment. seems forced. are these really my true thoughts or thoughts only in response to an assignment. I think I'm thinking too much. what time is it anyway. time to stop maybe. twenty minutes translates to a good number of thoughts huh. time to go, I've got errands to run. what time is it anyway. good only about thirty seconds left. ",1
1185,"Well right now it's 10:50 and I am thinking I'll be out of here in about twenty minutes and then I'll get something to eat, I feel very hungry it is probably because I didn't eat much last night or this morning, anyway I just remembered I have to cut the grass today what a pain. by the time I get home I am going to be so tired that I would just want to go to bed but no I have to cut the grass I guess I should forget about going to the gym today even though I promised myself I will go to the gym every Tuesday and Thursday. but o well at least I don't have to work today thinking about work I remembered there is that boat party next weekend that should be a lot of fun I haven't been to the lake for couple of months now, we used to go every week. it seems like a long time but it has only been about 6 minutes that I have been writing. I wander if I should return my study guide for calculus. I don't know if I need it or not. I am sure it will come in handy when doing homework but it is not required to have and it costs. I don't know maybe 40 dollars. It makes the job easier but at the same time I have to learn and try instead of just copying off the study guide. that was pretty nice of that guy giving me his psychology book for free I don't even know him. I was willing to pay half how much he paid for it but o well I probably should give him a gift card of some sort. Maybe I'll get one from work like a 30 dollar gift certificate. I feel kind of dizzy. I went to sleep late and then I had to wake up at seven to catch the bus and get here for my 8:30 discussion class to find out that they just covered the problem that I had questions about. and now I have been here at the lab for couple of hours string at screen doing my assignments for my computer science class. My eyes are getting pretty tired and the screen is becoming harder to focus on. I don't think this is good on my eyes definitely not. Well so far sitting here doing this has been the most fun I have had so far today, but still I just can't wait to get out of here. But hey where am I going to go? go to the bookstore and return the book? Or go to library and study for my macroeconomics class? maybe go to the gym ? no I am hungry I probably should get something to eat I don't know if I should call Vivian see if she wants to go get something to eat but she is probably sleep. I could call Lisa, I have to call somebody because I hate eating by myself. ",1
2167,"I'm hungry, but I don't have any of the food I normally eat. If I had a car, I'd go to the grocery store and buy myself some more Myoplex (protein shakes) and some cereal and some milk, but my parents heard too many horror stories about first year college students flunking out of school because they drove their roommate to wrestling matches and out-of-town football games and such, so they wouldn't let me bring my car this semester. If I had gone to school out of state, like both my brother and sister did before me, I wouldn't be getting a car for the entire first year, but since my school tuition is roughly one third of what theirs was, and I have some scholarships on top of that, my parents are considering letting me bring my car to Austin at semester. I really don't know where there's room to park a Ford Expedition in this town, but I'll find some place. My car would have been nice to have last last Sunday morning, because there was a rowing team meeting at the boathouse, which is too far to walk to, and I ended up not being able to go because I couldn't find a ride. I was pretty upset, but My R. A. Danny, the one who talked me into trying out for the rowing team, told me to go to practice this morning anyway, and the coaches wouldn't mind. He was right. I just added my name to their list of names that they got at different meetings that I wasn't able to attend, went through the workout, and they told me to come back on Wednesday. It was a lot tougher than I would have thought, in some respects, but a lot less strenuous in others, when I look back at it. The one mile jog wasn't hard at all, and neither were the pull-ups, but eventually the sit-ups wore me out, and the jump-squats actually made me nauseous after a few sets. I think that's mainly because my legs were really sore from the gym the day before, which was a bad move on my part, but it's hard to say. I've never done jump-squats before, so I might have felt sick afterwards without being sore. We didn't get to go out on the water, which was somewhat disappointing, but the group of guys I was with are supposed to take a boat out on wednesday, while the other groups run body circuits, since that's all our group was able to do. We did actually take a boat down to the dock, and set it in the water, but I wasn't able to get in, and the boat never left the dock, so it wasn't as much fun as it could have been. I'm somewhat nervous about the next practice session. We get to use the rowing machines for the first time, and I've never used one before. I'm not sure if three sets of ten minutes is going to be a breeze, or if I'm really going to throw up this time. I work out 6 days a week, and I run, and most of my workouts are repetition, not heavy lifting, so I could definitely be in worse shape for rowing, but I'm still not sure how far away I am from the kind of endurance I need for the urgs"" (rowing machines. )  I would actually be stronger, but have less endurance if my shoulder hadn't been giving me problems all through high school. I pulled it while unloading some suitcases for some elderly friends at the New York airport after a two week cruise through Southern Europe. We went to the doctor, they told me to lay off it, and I did, but apparently it wasn't long enough. I was too anxious to get back in the gym, and I never let it heal completely, so about six months later I hurt it again. Six months after that, when it happened the third time, my parents took me to a doctor, and eventually to physical therapy. The therapist told me that my scapular region was too weak in comparison with my pectorals, triceps, biceps, and deltoids. Apparently I hadn't trained my back well enough to keep up with the rest of my upper body, which was causing my shoulders to carry all the strain of my movements, where the muscles in my back were supposed to be assisting the shoulder. The doctor was amazed that both shoulders hadn't been more severely damaged, but I was told that I wasn't beyond repair. A full month of therapy, very specific exercises, cross-friction massages, and ice massages helped a lot, but my shoulder is still pretty fragile. If I push myself too hard on the bench press, or if I don't put ice on my shoulder while stretching it for about ten minutes after every workout, it's sore for the next few days. I'm hoping that rowing will help develop the muscles in my back, especially the scapular region, so I can push myself harder at the gym when I'm training the rest of my upper body. The pull-ups we did the first day of training worked parts of my back that I can feel had been neglected, because the muscles were all tight and sore after only two sets of the pull-ups. Apparently some muscle somewhere in my back is getting some work, so I'm happy with the training so far. I was actually worried for a while that I wouldn't be able to train the rest of my body if I got serious rowing, but the coaches talked to us about how rowing really only works out your back and your biceps, so the rest of your body will need developing too, like your chest and triceps. This means I can still go to the gym, and I actually have more reason now than ever, because I have to keep my chest strong enough to balance with the back muscles that I will undoubtedly be developing. Running and jump-squats in training won't come anywhere close to giving me the leg workout I want, but I'm not sure when I'll be able to work legs without being sore at training the following day. I suppose that after a few weeks of real practice, assuming I make the team, I'll be able to decide when to work my legs, and how hard. Some of the guys there seemed to have been working out, or playing football in high school, because they were pretty used to running body-circuits, and jogging, and weren't too beat at the end of the day. Some of the other guys were obviously novices in the world of fitness. A few people vomited, one guy passed out, and I heard talk about a guy who was trying the rowing workout a few days ago who fell flat on his face and started convulsing. I'm not sure exactly what was going on there, but I'm glad nothing like that has happened to me yet. I can't wait for it to get cold outside, so I can actually stand in that boathouse without wanting to collapse. It was so hot and stuffy in there today that going outside in the 80 degree weather felt like walking into a refrigerator. Once it gets colder, I'm sure I'll have to buy a sweatshirt, and some warmer gym shorts, but the cold will be much more welcome than the hot sticky boathouse. It'll be a lot colder if I fall in the water too, but I'm hoping that won't happen too often. ",1
185,"pennebaker I used to think it was spelled pennebaker and I couldnÃ¯Â¿Â½t logon to the web page cause I kept spelling it wrong, silly me. but thatÃ¯Â¿Â½s the story of my life I guess, one time, I thought I was going to psy class, but I had the day wrong, and I ended up going to a chemistry class!! and I said to the guy next to me, ""is that the usual guy who teaches?"" and he goes, ""yeah"" duh. and my eyes are pretty bad and so I was like, okay. and then well, he started talking about chemistry, and that's when I realized that I had the wrong day and was in the wrong class. but I was such a nincompoop, for some reason, I just didn't want to leave the class, maybe it was the really hot girl who sat down next to me, yeah, I guess it was probably her, but anyway I ended up staying in there and finding the class very interesting, and so I wouldn't look like a freshman, which of course I am, I started to take notes. you know, I won't keep them or anything, but I couldn't just sit there while this guy was giving this awesome lecture and not take notes!!! especially when that girl next to me was taking notes so fast like. but there's too many girls are this school. I mean, wait, I mean, too many girls who think they're pretty and try to hard. maybe there's too many guys in the same class, I wouldn't know. but like, I find it amazing. I mean, of course, in highschool, they're were girl who tried so hard to impress everyone and make themselves so beautiful, and all us guys were like the ones who try the hardest are the ones who fail the hardest!!! fail meaning don't do a good job of making them selves look good. I don't know, I just always preferred the beautiful ones who didn't have to paste on the makeup on for hours every morning. sometimes, I would and still wonder how long it takes a particular girl to get ready to go to a college class. it looks like it takes them FOREVER! it's amazing, I just get up, take a shower, do the person hygiene things that everyone does, put some clothes on, and go. I don't know. maybe I should spend more time getting myself prettier. I just find it disgusting, that's all. and one time, one of my friend sent me this email with the most awful, brutal, disgusting pictures IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve ver seen. I was so depressed for like days after I saw them. I don't know what they were of, I mean, if it was a war or what not. but it was these pictures of people who were dead, and they way the died, it was just horrid. I mean, IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve seen some nasty deadly pictures of hanging and shooting people and everything, but these were just simply horrid. and I never get sad or depressed these days, at least not any more. I used to be though. and get this, it was cause of a girl that I was so depressed!! can you believe that!? I was going out with her, right, and it was all good, and then one day she said not any more, and I couldn't believe it. it was such a shock, I was amazed, and therefore depressed for like, well, for months, probably around 6 months were I felt that I was leading two separate lives!! it was horrible. and you know, with things like that, the only thing that helps is time. lots of it. I guess thatÃ¯Â¿Â½s what my uncle is going through. uuhh, lemme see, I think it was probably about 5 months ago, maybe more, maybe less, my cousin was at a party where many illegal substances were being used, cocaine, speed, you know, those terrible drugs. he ended up getting in to a fight over the use of a telephone with some African American male (my cousin and I are Hispanics, well, IÃ¯Â¿Â½m just half Hispanic and half white, but he was pure blood) and they got into a fight, and the African American guy ended up stabbing my cousin and killing him. it was instant or anything, my cousin was a really big guy. strong and big and everything. he had a wife and a daughter. she's so beautiful. she had no idea what was going on at her fathers funeral. I mean, she's old enough to walk and talk and stuff like that, but she was clueless. and so I was I for that matter. she probably understood it more than I I did the more I think about it. his funeral was so so, well, the most beautiful and sad thing IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve ever seen in my life. that's what my mom said about princess DianaÃ¯Â¿Â½s death, but it pertains to this as well, at least for me. we buried him. in a cemetery, next to some family members. he was 21. it wasn't his time. it wasn't his place. but, God has a reason for everything, you know. I wonder if IÃ¯Â¿Â½m just writing this out and nobody is going to read this, and I wonder if and when you, if there is a you, reads this, when that will be. it's 5:28 p. m. Wednesday, august 10th, 1997. I miss him. another really close friend of mine died of cancer on march 13, 1995. but we won't go there, things just kind ad up you know? Anyway, did you know that right now and for the past 2 decades Neptune has been the farthest planet from our sun!? did you know that!? I didn't! I was amazing, my thumb is really hurrying from hitting the space bat so darn often. I miss my cousin. I didn't know him well enough. my other cousin, all the full blood ones, the true ones, they took it a lot harder that I did. they were into to things like that, and it was like a wake up call for them. for me, it was a wake up call that I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t' think IÃ¯Â¿Â½m ever going to pick up. it's like it hasn't really happened, STILL. after all this time, I STILL hasn't really happened!!! is that amazing? talk about denial. but it's more than just denial for me, I mean I truly still don't think it's hit home yet. it s just one of those things you read about, see on T. V. it's not something that happens to your cousin. my cousin was murdered. my cousin was murdered. can't believe that, saying that, my cousin was murdered!? is it true? was he murdered seriously!? can that be, is it possible!? is that SO!? IS THAT SO!? I PRAY TO GOD THAT THE PERSON WHO KILLED HIM REALIZES HIS SINS IN JAIL, FOR THE NEXT 25 YEARS AT LEAST WITHOUT BAIL, AND I PRAY TO GOD HE REPENTS FOR HIS SINS, AND I PRAY TO GOD THAT GOD FORGIVES HIM, CAUSE LORD KNOWS I NEVER WILL     in memory of Shawn Albert Deolloz ",0

Now I'm just going to write about anything because I'm hungry and tired. Today was a good day until this stupid thing happened. I'm mad. Tomorrow I'm going to San Antonio and I hope me three friends from Dallas can come visit me. It'll be all of them, Johnny, Cleo, my mom, and my two sisters. Lauren's letter made me cry. It was about how proud she is of me and all that good stuff. It was sweet too. Jesse made me cry yesterday because he got me something for my birthday and I thought he hated me since I'm with Johnny and all. That was sweet of him, but I wouldn't consider going back with him because of all the bullshit he put me through. He used to hurt me more emotionally than physically, but he did both at times. My other writing assignment was all nice and this one is all about bad things. Anyways, being 18 will be cool. I finally get to go into the club legally, meaning without a fake id. I also get to get my own bank account, either Wells Fargo or the University Federal Credit Union. I also get to go get my driver's license, because I never went to driver's education. Yeah! Okay, I'm a little happy now. Johnny is a good boyfriend though. He really cares about me and puts me first on what he should put me before. Like he rather be with me than his friends. That's cool sometimes, but I saw him this summer just enough to know that he really likes me. He hasn't called me yet. Oh oh I'm sad again. I miss him, and I'm glad I get to see him and all my friends tomorrow, hopefully my friends. I still have homework or should I say dormwork to do. HAHAHAHA! Okay that was corny, but I'm still cool. Oh yeah I'm going to a party at around 9:30. Oh oh I guess I'll have to call Johnny by then if he doesn't call me. He said he was going to the mall, so maybe that's where he's at. I know he had practice today so he got out at 5, but he still hasn't called me. Well it's still light outside, so I guess that's okay. Two more minutes and I hope the my laptop doesn't mess up again. Well today was a great day and I feel like Doey Howser typing away at my computer. That was dumb but I'm mad so I guess that's okay. Well times up, bye. ",1

I still don't know. Mr. Rist would say I'm as good as damned now. Dying has so much stress attached to it. Maybe that's why I could never go through with it. I know that if I went back to a place like Millwood I'd give up and stay there forever or at least a month or two. I wouldn't care at all this time. I don't dream very much anymore. At least I don't remember them. I sleep so well during the day but it's harder at night. It's that damned melotonin crap. Commie Bastards!  Oh well. God I wish my nose would stop dripping.

1535,"I am so excited that I get to see my family this weekend. I never thought I would feel so home sick at college. I love my mother so much she has been through hell and back and still remains such a wonderful Christian mother. If I am half the mother she is to me when I have children I know I will be doing a great job. I am also really nervous about this presentation I have to do on Monday for my Media Studies class. Not only do I not know what to write about but I don't know how to prepare for it. Of course I got there late for my discussion group  so I got the bottom of the barrell when signing up for a presentation topic and the only one left was for Monday. But that is so my luck. It makes me think that if I am nervous about giving this in front of my discussion group of maybe twenty people how am I going to make it in the communications field which is what I am majoring in at this point. I really want to work for MTV. I know many people must think of this as a childish fantasy, but it is really something I am serious about and want to persue. I just love everything about music. The artists there story, the songs story, and how they make people fell. I can't wait till I am done typing this because then I get to go play Crainum with my roomate and a couple of our friends from back home. I am such a competitive person which to me is a good thing because it makes me have more determination then most people. I am watching Will and Grace and they are talking about having a baby. Gosh I can't wait till that day. I think I must have orange cones around me though and a flashing message that tells guys don't talk to her!  I swear they avoid me at all costs. What the heck is wrong with me. I think I might be a little intimidating because I don't play the role of a dumb girl who needs a guy to take care of her. Which I think I got that from my mother. She is a single mom, my father died when I was ten, who is a teacher and had to raise three children all by herself. She didn't need help from anyone and she never threw in the towel when times got hard. For that I respect and love her very much. God has blessed me with the best family I could have ever imaged. Not only my imidate family but everyone from my grandparents to aunts and uncles to cousins. All of them have played such an important part of my life and have thought me so much that I just want to go and hug all of them and say thanks for loving me it has given such strength. My grandparents are so great because they can always make me feel like a million bucks even when I am at my lowest. I think it is important to surround yourself with a close knit family. I don't know what I would do without mine. I am so glad I have my roomate and friends from back home here at UT. I probably won't have latest this long without them and there company. They all have such interesting stories that I had never know about them before. Most of my school went to Texas a and m which is exactly like my hometown. We all just needed something different and a place with a good sports team ",1

She has always been there for me, so it is actually kind of hard to make my own decisions. But it is also good, cause it is definitely time for me to grow up!  My brother came in town for the first time in several months and I did not get to see him, but it didn't bother me, because I know he didn't miss me. He was away for the Navy, and I wrote him a letter, and he never wrote me back. He has put my family through so much crap, that I don't know when I am going to be strong enough to see him. Thank god the rest of my family is so caring and sane!  Life goes on, and he will soon realize how important his family really is, especially after all we have done for him. At first, I was extremely nervous about school and Sorority rush, but now everything is getting better. I was so glad when I became a Zeta because that is what I wanted from the start. It was just kind of hard because when we were practicing for Phi Psi field day, they tried to put me up in a stunt, and made me feel soooo fat. I am already so self conscious about my weight, so it really hurt me. I really don't want to have an eating disorder, especially after a movie being made about my aunt and her failure as an Olympic athlete because of balimia. Well, now after almost eight minutes, my arm hurts so much, and all i am wondering is when this is going to be over with!!!  I also hope that my studies turn out ok because I really have to study to get good grades, like REALLY!  I am just not smart like everyone else, or at least that is how I feel. I mean I like all my professors except for Pre-Cal, which really pisses me off because I took pre-cal and calculus in high school and aced them both. but this adjunct teacher does not teach at all. He goes over the basic formulas, which I have known since like eighth grade, and then gives us the most difficult homework, which he has not given any examples for or ways to understand in class. He also words the problems in the most bizarre ways. All the students are so confused, and it makes me feel so stupid, because it is just Pre-Cal!  So, today I went to the University of Texas Learning Center, and it really seemed to help. I think out of my class of thirty, there was three of us at that moment in there. So that already says enough about our teacher. Also, I emailed him about it, and he made me feel even stupider. I mean if he wants respect from me, then he needs to respect me!  He told me he couldn't pat my hand to make me feel better, etc. , and I was like, yeah, but you could try and teach us, instead of going over 8th grade algebra!!!  But oh well, I am trying to fix everything!  I just decided that I am going to be on top of all my studies, and try to keep up on the reading and all my math homework. I hope that I never forget about any important tests, or assignments, or papers. I am super glad I am in a FIG, because hopefully that will help. I am just super horrible with tests, because I have a major test anxiety. That would explain my horrible SAT score. But whatever, it is all good, I mean look, I made it to UT, didn't I~!  Well, since psychology is my major I hope this class keeps me super interested so I don't switch majors like five times, like every other college student!  I just want to know what I want to do with my life, besides marry my sweetie, and be successfull with my family and money. But, so far, I am so glad I have chosen UT, because I absolutely love it, and even though there have already been those times when I have felt so fat, or so overloaded with sorority stuff or reading( which I am also very slow at!), i know everything in the end will turn out just how it is supposed to, because God is here carrying me through out all my good times and my bad!  I just hope I can figure out this pretesting thing, because that would be awesome if I didn't have to do five hours worth of experiments, ya know!! ",1
511,"god I can still remember it. the last time we did that was at our graduation party. one of our friends that night was a real bitch. the party even though their were 4 of us had to have it her way. but she is going to live ion McAllen for the rest of her life and  of course the next time I will see her is when she is taking my fast food order  I am so happy to be here the guys are a big improvement from where I'm am from  tall and cute a real McAllen novelty. oh and the cafeteria guy is the best so far. this Friday I have instillation for apo.

1951,"well let's see. when your trying to think about what your writing. all you think about is what your thinking. Which is kind of weird, all I can think about is thinking, so I don't think I'm thinking about anything else. But let me try and think more than think about what I'm thinking. ok, I'm listening to depressing music, that's is really the only thing I listen to these days, it helps me get through the day. I need another rainy day is a good lyric I just thought about. I'm in a band called furkloven. when I'm not with my girlfriend, I'm with the band. I love my band. someday we will be famous, we are just waiting for the glorious day. I've never heard the song that I'm listening to right now, it might be one of the best songs I've ever heard. it is called raining in baltimore if you ever read this and what to hear what I am hearing right now. this is my kind of music. if I could sit in this room with a guitar, a piano, and my music for the rest of my life I would be happy. the only thing I have left to look forward in life is music. I love music and music moves me. I'm not sure what to think anymore. lets see if I can get on another topic. I have no classes on friday's so now I'm out for the weekend. I just realized if I close my eyes and type it is a lot easier to think. so if there are any typos that is the reason. because from now on I refuse to open my eyes. let my type the lyrics of the last song I wrote. it was about my ex girlfriend to broke up with me for no reason at all. for the third time. I loved her and it tore me up so bad everytime she did that. and I took her back twice after she did it but the third time I had to let her go. she had issues. and she hates this song because she heard it for the first time at the talent show last year. it didn't go over too well with her. here is goes. this song is called late night song"" I wrote it really late the night she broke up with me. hence the name: I spend my time alone, I wish you know the sadness that has grown, I fell in love, and it only fell apart, I never knew, I could have a broken heart. and I hope the way we lived, follows you forever and reminds you of the times we shared and I wish the time was still, cause we don't have long before we're gone and this late night song is all you'll ever have. its been a week today, the time has gone and I still feel the same. so hear this song, and try to make it last, its all you'll hear, cause I regret my past. and I hope the way we lived, follows you forever and reminds you of the times we shard and I wish, the time were still, we don't have long before we're going to and this late night song, is all you'll ever have, and I hate the way we lived, and I want to know where I stand, and I hate the way we lived, and I want to know who I am. and I hope the way we lived, follows you forever and reminds you of the times we shared and I wish, the time were still, we don't have long before we're gone and this late night song is all you'll lever have. there it is. it is a very popular song anywhere we go. its one of the favorites on the cd because a lot of people can connect with it. I have gotten emails telling me that people play it for their ex-girlfriends for revenge. because of the 'I regret my past' part. that's the part that got my ex girlfriend too. I'm listening to a song called goodnight elizabeth right now and it reminds me of my older brother'x ex-girlfriend. her name was elizabeth and she was one of the prettiest girls ever. the song actually resembles their relationship. my brother went to college at tulane in new orleans. and this song said I miss you in new orleans, but now I'm the king of the rain. which is probably referring to the rainy weather in southern louisiana. won't you fall down on me know won't you fall down on me. I love that lyric. cz I'm alone and your comin down. we just settle down down down down into home. I really respect counting crowes lyrics. they are one of the best bands ever in my mind. once our band starts getting bigger. we will change music I believe. our lead singer is amazing. and he is not like all the other singers out there. it is unique and all his lyrics are from the heart. his mother died of brain cancer a few years back and ever since then he has written the saddest and most beautiful songs. I didn't expect to be in college this year because of all the record company attention we have gotten lately and my parents agreed to if we got signed to a label, then we wouldn't be in school. right now we are very close to the signing. and I'm not sure if I will finish this semester or go live the life I will live for the rest of my life. I just wish I could major in being a rockstar. beyond the band. I have nothing real in my life, my band IS my life, and if I ever lose the guys, I will lose my life. ",0
1117,"Well, hello Mr. Paper. I am so happy to be here writing about what is on my mind. Where should I start. ""Start"", isn't that a funny word. About as funny as the guy next door because he is singing to some girly song. Well, this might be pretty long because I type pretty fast. My eyes are so tired. Sometimes I think my mind purposely pushes my eyelids down, hinting at me that I need to keep them shut for more than a few hours. Sometimes when I take deep breathes it hurts. ""Why?"" you ask. Well it is a long story. It doesn't hurt, but it puts a sharp pain in my left shoulder due to my car accident ( I won't get into it). So, I am a college student now. What does that exactly mean? I think it means I can finally be myself. I don't have to worry about what my parents will think. There is only one restriction still holding my true self down. My girlfriend that I still have, even though she doesn't even go to school here. She lives all the way over in Galveston, and I can't stand the way things are. I say that I am in love with her, but is that true when I am so happy to be away from her? Anyways, I say ""restriction"" because that is what she is right now. I literally have to check in with her, and she has to know everything I do. So I guess in a way I didn't get away from my parents. She took their place. So, I figure that as long as she is in Galveston, and completely attached to me, I have to have my fun here and then lie to her. I know it sounds bad, but if I were to tell her what I actually do here, I would have to spend endless amounts of hours on the phone with her because she would be so upset. OK, I am sick of talking about this. The women at this University are the most amazing I have ever seen. And I guess that is why I am having such a hard time with my girlfriend. I have never seen so many good looking women. I feel like I am in a candy store. And it helps that I am a good looking guy, because I get their attention. That sounds conceited, but I am an honest man. I know that some women are attracted to me, and I am attracted to many women. Also, I am highly flirtatious, so my girlfriend gets real scared with me being here. I just tell here all the girls are ugly. I brought a camera to school. I have some incriminating photos on that thing. I need to get those developed and locked away. Nothing too bad, but bad enough to get me in trouble with my girlfriend. You see, why does everything come back to her. I hate it. I don't want to have to worry about a relationship right now! But what do I do? I respect and love her too much to hurt her. So, I spend a lot of time trying to figure out what to do. Yet another thing I should be having to do. I just want to be here at college, go to class, study, meet people, have fun, and NOT worry about a relationship. Seriously, I have to get off this. Let's change the subject. I want to talk about cheese. Cheese is really weird. It comes from a cow, but how does it get to be cheese. I know there is an answer, but it is still a mystery in my mind. And then where do the holes come from? Are they bubbles of air, or did they just appear there, or did some kind of bug eat the cheese away? Swiss is my favorite. American is horrible. It just shouldn't be allowed. to be made. Cheddar is enjoyable. There are no other cheeses as far as I am concerned. They go great on hamburgers. With lettuce and mayo and ketchup, I can have myself a meal. Well, it is late and those little demons keep pushing my eye lids down, so I will end it here. It was wonderful to type on this lovely screen! ",1
1355,"I feel that I am not very satisfied with school right now. I don't have that many friends but I am sure that I'll start making some soon. I miss my home and my miss my family and I miss my girlfriend who is also in fort worth. I always talk to her and I wish she was here all the time. I miss her a lot and all I can think about is being able to talk to her. school seems a little hard. I haven't gotten used to the studying habits yet. I know that I will soon get back into the grove though. I can't wait until I get to go home this weekend. I want to go home every weekend but I know I can't. it is so hot out side and I want things to cool down just a little bit. I want to be able to go out and play but I don't like going to parties and that's all people want to go do. so it seems like there isn't ever anything to do down here unless you go to a party. all I want to do is go home. it is a lot more fun at home. I don't understand why people say college is so fun when I haven't really had any fun yet. I don't want to join any frats because I don't think they're worth it. and I also hear that they make enemies also. and I don't want to make any enemies down here. my classes are kind of confusing. and since I don't know any body in the classes, I don't feel comfortable asking the people next to me questions. the weeks go by so slow. the only thing that I like about school so far is that I get done with school on Friday at eleven o'clock. that way I can leave for fort worth much sooner. my arms are starting to hurt and I still have just gotten started. time is going by so slow. I want to get out of my supplement housing. I don't like having a room with three other guys. and I don't like my room not having a sink or a mirror. I sort of like the big classes though. it makes class seem more fun. I am so sleepy right now. I don't know if I want to do my home work any more. I might just want to go home and take a nap. my room is so cold. we tried to get the a/c turned down but it still blows super cold air. and plus I sleep on the top bunk right by the a/c vents so it blows right on me. I always get a really cold nose in the middle of the night. and I also have a room mate with a really loud alarm. his alarm constantly goes off and he keeps hitting the snooze button. so every nine minutes it goes off again and again and again. it's so annoying. it's like just freaking wake up or turn off your alarm. I don't understand these people. and would be trying to sleep and then he walks into the room and turns on the lights which light up the whole room. and I'm trying to sleep. he has a little lamp but he doesn't use that instead. talk about no consideration. I don't like having to go down the hall to the bathroom just to brush my teeth. or going down to the bathroom just to put some lotion on my face. I want to be able to just wake up and do all that in front of a sink and a mirror that I don't have and what every body else does. I am getting tired of writing and I'm glad that the twenty minutes is almost up. I wonder if you guys are really going to be reading this thing all the way through. I wonder if you think I'm weird for saying some things that I have said. I wonder if I'm the only person that feels this way. last time I played basketball and now I am very sore. it's hard for me to walk around. I think I'm about to fall asleep on the computer. I can barely keep my eyes open. well sorry guy but my twenty minutes just about to up. bye bye and I hope y'all have a good day. ",1
1689," yes, here i am, finally. I never thought i would be doing this, ever. This is so weird. it's so weird, whenever i'm under any type ofpressure, i can never type well. it's so weird. but it's probably pretty common. everyone gets underpressure. i hate it thoguh. because i never feel like i'm  a good typist. i never was though. even when first started learning in 5th grade. i was always the last one to finish my lines, or whatever. 5th grade. that was so long ago. i was just thinking about that the other day. i remember that was a grade of so many changes. i just realized that i'm very nostalgic. i constantly look back on my past. maybe that's becasue i was sexually abused as a child. it's weird. i just read a quote a couple of weeks ago that said   life can can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forwards.  That's so true. because i believe that everything in anyone's life, the way they are, their personality, their mannerisms, their characteristics, everything- stems from childhood. if someone is abused as a child, they will either become an abuser themself, or even worse, a serial killer, or they will spend the rest of their life dealing with it as best they can, praying to god that it will never happen again to them, or anyone else they love. that's me, i think. i'm obviously not going to abuse myslef, nor bacome a serial killer. i don't think. haha. no, i'm just kidding. don't worry, it's weird how one's thoughts wander, isnt it? i could never picture myself being a serial killer. i just hate dead bodies. they make me have nightmares. well, not really. but after i saw that movie, seven. . oh my gosh. i think my brain even squirmed. it was a good plot, though. i will admit that. that's another thing. you know how people criticize people like eminem and marilyn manson, and other outreagous people in the media? sometimes they can't help their success. sometimes they are just stopped on the street, and some exec says, hey i wnat to make money off of your emotions. and that's just what they do. they make huge names out of these people just so they can money, and then the stars themslves are happy because they can express themselves and they make money. so tehir success is just plain luck ,a lot of the time. so you can't always blame those peolpe for their success. blame the people that signed them. . okay, my 20 min are up, so i'm going to go now. wow, this was very theraputic , in a way. i'm goi g to make chicken parmesan tonight!! yum!!

607,"But I guess I'm supposed to be trying new things here in college. What's on my mind right now is the question at hand. So I would say right now I am thinking most about what's going on with me socially. I feel like I keep meeting all these girls and I know I'm never going to become more than friends with any of them. People tell me I'm too much of a nice guy and not aggressive enough when it comes to getting girlfriends. But who  really knows what anyone else is thinking or what another person wants. I for one have no clue what other people want from a friend or what a girl would be looking for in me but I guess that's the mystery of life. But it sure seems weird how other people seem to have things all figured out. Like my suite mate gabe, I mean he doesn't have to do anything  and everyone is like I want to be your friend and girls are like please have sex with me. I have a lot of friends but Its like I really want one girl to be more and I can't seem to get from being  friends with a girl to more but maybe its because I haven't met the girl I want to be more than friends with, oh but that's bull shit cause I know I've met plenty of very attractive girls that I would love to get with but never have. but what can I do. It also seems like some weird forces of nature are working against me on the social thing when it comes to girls or I mean my own personal looks, cause I have had a clear of acne face for over 7 months and then right before I move to college KABOOM, it hits me after I go one week without using my prescription cause I ran out. I refilled it but then again it takes awhile to work so I was going through the transitional period then finally a couple days ago i'm truly completely clear and then the next morning I wake up with this huge cold sore on my lip. The biggest monstrous blister right on my lip. that's really going to make me look good for the girls. And right now I still have this blister. I fell like I have to wait for the blister to go away before I ask any girls out like this girl I met at this foam party this weekend. I talked to her on Tues. but we couldn't get together but now I think I may try to wait till this blister goes away before I try to meet with her again anyway. rrGeez, my back hurts right now, hold on a sec while I adjust my seat. there we go. I am really rambling on about the girls situation but I guess that's what's really on mind throughout most of my college days. I also have the work but that just seems like busy stuff to me. to tell the truth psychology is actually so far my favorite class. Not only because there are so many hot girls there but because the actual material I think is cool, like this assignment for one. I might end up writing for way more than 20 min without realizing it. Well in psyche I met this girl Becky and we were walking together to jester and I just truly wonder if we ever become friends, sure we happened to meet and walked together to class one day and sit together but I somehow doubt it will happen again and that's just another example of me just becoming friends, because if I do see her again we will probably only become friends that meet maybe to study or something but I guess having a lot of good looking friends is better than no friends who are girls. back to school though I cla isn't that bad of coarse math is one of my specialties, and chem I like cause I like my professor but physics seems to be the same as high school, a boring monotone voiced professor who doesn't explain things clearly in my opinion, and I know I could get good grades if they just taught from the books cause I have the ability to learn very well but tests don't come straight from the text books do they. so that may pose as a problem, but I have a class in 20 min that I need to start heading towards so now that I've typed for 22 minutes I think ill let you go now, Later.

151,"I just messed up. it has been a while since IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve typed. It probably won't turn out to good. I wonder what time it is. I am kind of worried about my friend from Sealy. I just got off the phone with her and she has lost twenty pounds. She looks really good but she wants to lose twenty more and I think that is a little to much . This assignment is so easy and I keep messing up. This keyboard feels funny. the backspace key seems further away than usual. I just stopped typing because I can't figure out why when you get to the end of a line it won't continue to the next line it just keeps going. My roommate is standing behind me reading what I am writing . I don't care if I misspelled something because they arenÃ¯Â¿Â½t checking on spelling. I am so glad Chase called tonight. It makes me feel so much better to know that he cares a little. If he didn't call though I was going to call him and figure out whets up between us. I can't believe it is ten o'clock. I have been studying since about six. I talked on the phone though with my friend for about 30 minutes. I wonder why the words skipped down to the next page. I hope I didn't mess this up. I cant wait to get y hair cut tomorrow. I hope it turns out good. I cant wait to see Chase. I hope I am doing this right because there is only two lines of words appearing on the page. I wonder who my roommate is calling. Maybe it is that girl he met this weekend. about 15 minutes has already gone by. I am going to go on a diet tomorrow. I wonder why he keeps pushing all the numbers on the phone ,I keep hearing that beeping noise. I don't have that much time left and then I am going to take a bath. I can't seem to capitalize my I's. I wonder what the next writing assignment is about. I think I am going to do it tomorrow night so that I can get it out of the way. I wish I could type really fast. I wonder how fast Mary can type. I need to do some more reading tonight before I go to bed and I really need to see my math TA before class tomorrow so that I can get some help with my math. I wonder why the e didn't stay at the end of the word it skipped down to the next line. my typing has gotten better though since I started this assignment. I wonder who just came in the door. I have about one more minute to write. I wonder what my roommate is studying. I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t know what else to write. I wonder if they are ever going to read this. If someone happens to read this HI!  I bet its pretty boring reading all of these. My time is up Bye! ",0
1510,"I have no idea wher to begin. Im sitting in my dorm and the sound of th a. c. and the fans is driving me crazy. Its like either be hot or be completely annoyed. Besides that, I have twenty different other things on my mind. Am I going to bo to the SI session tonight or am I just going to study so I can go out tonight? Should I even go out tonight? I feel so nervous all the time that Im not using my time wisely. I don't feel at home in this dorm yet so its hard for me to have an organized lifestyle that I am comfortable with. I am so hungry but if I take the time to eat I could be taking time out of other things and I still have another 15 minutes to write so I really can't stop to eat yet. Mainly food is on my mind along with allthe other things I still need to do. It seems like it never ends. Its wierd because when I am studying I feel so enlightened by learning things and I also feel like I am getting a lot accomplished but when I am not studying no matter what the reason, I feel like I am wasting time or getting behind. I wish I could know where I stand compared to the other students as far as knowledge and studying goes. I am so tired and overwhelmed and excited all at once about everything that my mind is going crazy. This whole writing thing is also making me crazy because at times I can't think of what to write and I feel like I have to be constantly writing. Peolpe keep calling my cell phone and I want to answer it but I don't want to loose my train of thought but I guess that doesnt matter because as long as I write what I am thinking its ok but whatever. I keep worrying that the thinking that the things I am writing are making me sound depressed and that along with prof. pennebaker saying that most college students are depressed really disturbs me because I am not one to be depressed and it doesnt sound very fun. I feel really bad that I am ignoring these phone calls because i always seem to ignore the person who is calling. ",1
807,"it is about 509 and my roommates comp is making some noise and it has stopped now. I am now thinking about what I will (telephone noise) do when it is 529. that is when I will stop typing. I am thinking a bout my girlfriend. she is at a and m. I have a yaga sticker on my cd case. I took my cds out of my chest the other day, I mean yesterday, becaues I am not really worried about people stealing them any more. I once heard tht people sometimes steal toher peoples' pilows. my gir(keyboard is on my lap but io just took it off because I don't like that) I wish I could type faster but I can type plenty fast enough to do what I need to do. I have not really been using a lot of instant messenger lately. there are some people that I think it would be awkward to talk to like my gf. we kind of left withoutut breaking up but we both know it will not work ou. when I told my friend adam that she felt the same as me but I showed him her email and he believed me. she is not really like most girls and I said that was cool and he agreed with  me. I like to abbreviate when I typ and that comes from working on emails. I stopped for a seconnd to scroll up on the mouse because it does not move down by itself. I am now thinking how I do not type fast enough to say exactly what I think when I think it but I have to remember things (other things) as I am typing the thought that directly preceded it. my roommates are now staring at me as I type this and I am writing about it because that is what I am supposed to do. I hve stopped for a second to tell them about what the prof said today about the guy copyin gand pasting the computer manual and I thought that was pretty funny. my cousin did one of these stream of consciousness things and I don't think that I spelled that correctly. I think that this is getting pretty long enough and I will prolly cut it short before my time is up because I can. I know that rice university has the honor system and I don't know whether that would be cheating or not . it is now 518 and I have been typing for about nine minutes. whenever I write numbers I think it is easier if I just spell the number out but thinking back to this writing assignment, I have been spelling the time, so I don't know what that means. the social security comment was funny today. I accidentally came late to my french class today, the first day of school of all times, because I was playing squash and I thought it started at three instead of two. I actually think the yaga thing on my cd case is pretty cool even though yaga is not really a well known brand anymore. I would like to go to the gym todya but I would also like to et a  head start on the homework because I am still pretty motivated toward school, and I hope I will keep it up but I'm really not that sure because I know that this is different thatn highschool and I think I will like it more but my french teacher today told us some fascinating things about how speech is first started in babies and I was fascinated but then I went after calsss and apologized becase I was late. there is some real audo stuff we shoudl do for homework but I would like to do it in my own room instead of in the library becaus I don't know if we have to talk in to the computer or what. I am going to go now and I'd lkike to play some squash because it is fun. ",1
1639,"Today I got a new washer and dryer. I know this is kind of corny to write about, but I am so excited. I won't have to use the laundry room for the apartment complex anymore, because now Ã¯Â¿Â½ have my own washer and dryer. It cost one dollar to wash and one dollar to dry, in the wash room. My clothes didn't event come out dry. I was so pissed. I am very very thankful for my parents. I would not have this BRANDNEW washer and dryer if it were not for them. God has truly blessed us as a family. My family is a strong, close family. They are always there for me and my sisters no matter what happens. Right now my nieces and nephew ar living with my mom and dad. My sisters are in the Navy,so their children stay with my parents. My mom loves it, but I know it is very hard on her. It is hard on me when I go home to visit. I never get any rest. I am always up around 7:00 in the morning. Someone is always crying at one time or another. Especially Zac, he cries around three in the morning when everyone is asleep. I love going home, but man I get so happy when it is time for me to com back to Austin. This typing thing is going by pretty slow. I swear I have been on here for ten minutes already. I don't even know what else to type about. I could type about my ex-fiance, that would take more than twenty minutes. I am still paying for my foolishness behind him. We were together for a long time, then he proposed. yeah, that same old traditional, only the right way to go kind of things. Anyway, we were together for a long time, about 2 yrs. He proposed in front of my whole family on Dec. 23, which happened to be the day my family celebrated Christmas that yeat. I cried, I said yes . Then all of the drama started, he wanted ot hang out with his friends all of the time , and I just got tired of all of the foolishness. I guess he got tired of all of it too. SO, he broke up with me. I cired for a little while, but my mom helped me out a lot. She told me,   Every woman has her heart broken at least one time, and baby this is your time  . I didn't want to believe it but it was true. I faced the facts, picked up my heart and moved on. It's not time yet!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ghosh the insanity. I guess I will type really slow so time will go by really fast. I never knew twenty minutes would take this long. Time flys by when you're having fun. I guess this is not one of those times. I'm almost there though. I wonder what everyone else wrote about. You know, I feel like I'm talking to myself or some kind of imaginary friend. This seems so funny. Well I guess I'll take these last few minutes to say my goodbyes. I'm just playing, wasn't that funny. No, I didn't think so either. It's only 9:57, I thought it was eleven o'clock. I did that eleven o'clock to waste time. TWO MORE MINUTES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I can almost see the light at the end of the tunnel. It's so delightful. I guess my fingers needed the workout. Poor fingers. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm what to  do, what to do . 10, 9, 8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,          ",1
1351,"I'm sitting in the library at 4:45am once again. Now I'm wondering why it is that I insist on pulling these all nighters constantly, and doing it without proper sleep or rest. Oh well. It's really cold in here, but it always is. I really shouldn't be getting distracted by the temperature in here. I should be more worried about the EE test that I have to take this semester or the CS class that I have to pass, although neither of them are weighing on my mind with the magnitude that they should. I'm begging to miss surfing again. I thought that the three weeks home this summer would help cure me of my love of the ocean, but it didn't. It never does. I need to be playing guitar more also. I've let it slip quite a bit here lately. I know the reason for that, I've let myself get too distracted with the girls around me. I allow them too much power over my life, and my actions. But that's ok because I'm done with all of that. I'm really going to try to cut my ties to all of what is negative in my life. Well at least as far as my friends go. I've begun to realize more and more how much people use me. The funny part of it is they all think that they're getting away with something, when in fact I'm quite aware of what is going on around me and what is happening to me. I guess I just give people to much damn credit. That's another thing I'm over. Despite how much I say I don't want those people in my life I know that I crave them being there due to my own insecurities and my need to have other gay people around me. But why the hell to I feel the need to have those gay people around me? They end up making me feel more ostracized than accepted. I'll never become what they see as normal. For that matter, I don't want to become that. I don't want to go out and sleep around, and do the drugs and all that other crap. It just occurred to me that who ever reads this will think that I'm writing this solely to seem like some good kid, yeah right. I'm not, but then again, they'll never know that. I find this assignment odd. I'd love to read what other students write, and more importantly I'd love to know how much of it is truly stream of conscious writing and how much of it is just premeditated butt kissing. Once again something I'm sure I'll never know. But sure enough something I'll ponder for at least a little while. I'm sure I'll be able to use that as an intricate procrastination method when I should be studying for one of the many classes that I'm taking this semester which are surely going to kill me. Man, I meant to pay my phone bill today. I've got to do that tomorrow. My credit is going to be so screwed. I've screwed up so bad as far as money goes this past few years, well actually it's been this past year. I just don't even like to think about money. It makes me sick to my stomach every time I think about it. If I were the least bit intelligent I would learn to budget or even better yet keep a check book like a normal person but oh no. God, there's that damn word again, ""normal"". I've come to despise that word. It seems like everywhere I turn I'm being bombarded with it, and what's worse is the fact that no matter who's throwing it at me I'm not fitting it. I just hate that word. Who's right is it to decided weather or not I'm normal. Who gets to decide what is normal. I think that's what I want to be when I grow up. the one who decides what's normal. No I don't want to do that, changed my mind. I don't want to put any more labels into this world than already exists. Speaking of things I've got to do soon, I need to change my oil. Since Chris and I drove to Dallas yesterday that put me nearly 200 miles where I was supposed to change it. I used to never let it get that far over. School has become such a distraction to my life. I know it's bad when my parents keep telling me that I'm working too hard and taking school too serious. I guess it all goes back to working hard at school as being a way of running away from everything else. It's just so much easier to come up to the library and work, and at least do something productive, rather than sitting around and dwelling over the drama and crap that exits in my life. Most of which I can't do a damn thing about. That's another thing I need to work on accepting what I can change and what I can't. I seem to get it in my mind that I solve the problems of the world. Before I do that I need to get my own life straightened out. I can't even get a date, and I think I can give the world leaders advice as to how to prevent war. Ok, sure Heidi, you can't even have a relationship with someone your own age who speaks you're language and you think you're going to go and create world peace with people who don't even speak English, sure. Talking about impossible problems I wonder when my new computer will get here. I really need to start on my program for my CS class. There's another thing that just makes me sick every time I think about. To think that I've got to get an A in that class to go to Germany next year just scares the crap out of me. Not much scares me. A lot of things will worry me. I worry too much. I try to deny it when other people tell me that, because common what the hell do they know about me? Well, Kid, a lot. I swear I get worried about the kid who's lonely their first year at college on the AT&T commercials. Alright that's a little overboard again, but oh well. I need to go buy some new study CD's this week. NO, NO. No more spending money. Where do I think I'm going to get this money from? DO I think it's just going to come to me when I'm not working or anything? And I know damn well that as soon as I get that new computer all I'm going to want to do is buy DVDs and programs for that crap. That's the last thing I needed to get on my laptop was a DVD player. That's just great. Now I can come to the Library to study and sit and watch a movie. And knowing me, that's something I would do just to show off my new toy. And I know that's part of the reason that I spent the extra money what to say that I've got a laptop with a DVD player on it. I say I'm not worried by what other people think, and I really don't think I am, but I sure as hell love it when they think I'm cool. Or even better yet, when they envy me. I think I get off on the whole envy thing because it makes me feel as though if there is a reason for people to envy me then my life isn't as messed up and pathetic as it seems most of the time. It's really not that bad, I just think I need to be on antidepressants. That's really common with the whole ADHD thing, but then again the whole ADHD thing brings in a whole new question of who has it, how to diagnose etc. It's really scary to see that these are the things that I think about when I've got free time to think. I really need to find a hobby of some sort. I mean I have one, I have several actually, but it's not really things I just sit and think about. Well music is, but I'm not going to sit here and write songs. I'm not in the songwriting mood. Although, if I didn't have so much work to do I wouldn't mind working on my comic book. I'm getting started on another character. I've got enough male characters the next one will be a female. Not quite sure any of the particulars yet. I'm sure it will be something along the line of goodlooking, selfsufficient, muscular, you know all of those things that most people don't relate to being in package deal with women. Ah, I like this song. It always reminds me of home. I miss my parents right now. I don't get home sick often but when I do it really hits me hard. It's hard to believe that I've been gone from home for two years now. It just doesn't seem real. So much has happened. This past year has changed my life without a doubt. I mean I never thought I would get the courage to tell my parents that I'm gay, or for that matter I never thought that I would get the courage to tell my sisters. What blows my mind is the fact that now I can sit and talk about it to my mom and dad more openly than I ever saw my sisters do with their straight relationships. Family, man. Another think that hurts to think about. I wish we could do with all the crap. I wish there wasn't the stupid petty shit that there is. I'd really love to know who is Waxahachie told my sisters that I'm gay. I mean someone else has to know from the way the whole town knows. I wish I knew that Sonja, my own flesh and blood would stand up for me, but then again I know that's never going to happen. I've sat though too many gaybashing sessions with her. That's another thing that just amazes me, how the same people can raise three kids, it what seems to be the exact same way, and they can turn out so different. Speaking of raising kids, I need to decide about grandpa's funeral. I really really don't want to give the eulogy. I had so much contempt for this man not 6 months ago, but then again I know that I should because it's one of his last wishes. Why should I honor his last wishes though? What has he done for me? That's wrong of me to say. I know that, and I know that in the end no matter how much I don't want to do it, I'll end up speaking at his funeral. That's right I need to call them tomorrow and see what the Dr. said, then I need to call the Dr. and see what they have to say. Never can get the same story from both. ",1
2245,"Today was a pretty calm day. Nothing outrageous happened. Right now I feel hungry, probably because the last time I ate was at 6:50 or so and I didn't have much. I tired this new stir fry stuff and some mashed potatoes. It was ok but I guess it was only filling for the time being. I almost forgot I had this assignment due tomorrow. I sprang out of bed as soon as I remembered. earlier my suite mates and I watched a movie at the union called Mean Girls. It was good and they showed it for free too so there were a lot of people there. They show a lot of movies at the union. The next dorm family event planned for us is to go and watch the movie Troy. My roommate's friend is going to make her and I watch the movie schindler's list sometime soon. He is a big movie fan and is going into the college of communication and he wants to be a director later on. He has already made a movie. He made it in high school and he went around and just videotaped the different events and people at school. My roommate said it was good. She just told me that her chemistry professor wrote the book they use in class. Its not just him but he has contributed to writing the book. He has his name on the cover of the book and everything. I'm going home to Houston next weekend to see my family and to attend this bayou bhangra competition that all my friends are going to. Its going to be really fun. I can't wait to see my baby sister she's just too cute for me. I love her and she's a miracle baby too especially because she serviced through my mom's accident and all the medication my mom had to take during her pregnancy. But I guess that's God's love and blessing and I am very thankful for everything he as done for me and my family but I don't know what to think of him after my aunt and uncle's freak accident and death. I don't understand why he sends us these extraordinary people and then just takes them away from us before its time for them to go. I don't know I suppose its just one of those things that happen and can't be explained. And I believe that things happen for a reason but I don't know how God can justify their death and all these things that have been happening to our entire family. Things haven't seem to be right ever since my grandmother passed away. Well that's all I can think of to write about and its time now too, how convenient. Bye ",1
23,"I'm feeling jealous right now. I got an email from one of my friends. She informed me that my x-girlfriend is now dating a new person. It makes me mad. I don't know why. I don't like her anymore. Oh, well, just forget it. I'm hot. maybe it has something to do with the recent news. I guess I just need to ""cool off"". I really like it here at UT. everybody is very nice. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m trying to think of what to type. IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve got this particular song in my head, and I can't get rid of it. it's aggravating. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m tired. I wish I could take a nap, but the dorms are to loud. wow, she's pretty. I wonder if she'll be my future wife. maybe, maybe not. I wonder if I should ask Emily to dinner tonight. I can't think of a way to ask her without making it sound like a date. I fear being rejected. I guess that's what pisses me off about my x. she ""just friended"" me, but I think the real reason was never mentioned. I hope she rots in hell. EmilyÃ¯Â¿Â½s really nice. she seems really mature. I almost consider her a big sister, but not really. she just acts like she could be. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m getting sick of jester food. it all tastes the same. like shit. she's attractive. every girl here is really pretty, with some exceptions of course. so far, it seems like college has been all play and no work, except for this of course. there's so many people here. sometimes it's overwhelming. so much diversity. and yet, so much organization. I really like the atmosphere. the game last night was a blast. IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve never had so much fun at a game. so much spirit and energy running through the air. being in the band is the best thing that's happened to me in a long time. it's taught me a lot. I think IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve grown up so to speak. the idea of a computer lab strikes me as funny. all these people here, right next to each other, but there's still a sense of privacy. no one ever seems to look at other people's work. so much organization in so much chaos. I like Macs better than PCÃ¯Â¿Â½s. I don't know why. they just appeal to me more. I wish I had a girlfriend. it's been a long time since IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve been with someone. I miss it. I like the fact that my parents live here. we don't always get along, but I think that if they lived in another state, or even another city, I wouldn't be doing half as well here. I like the security. it's nice not having to miss them. and to not be homesick. I wish I could stay here forever. I don't want to have to get a job. but, at the same time, I often feel bad that my parents have to pay for my education. IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve always been that way. I really love my family, I just don't know how to show it very well. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m ready to start doing more work in classes. they're starting to get boring. I wonder what's to become of Ginny. IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve always liked her, ever since high school. she lives so far away, Alabama. IÃ¯Â¿Â½d love to date her. maybe because while I was with her, I never got the chance. damn, I wish I had the opportunity now. girls are so pretty. why?  sometimes, they get in the way of more important things. sometimes I like the distraction, but sometimes it hurts me. I think IÃ¯Â¿Â½m going to do well here. no problem. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m very good at adaptation. I think my time's about up. ",1
158,""" Stream of Consciousness ""  Everyday about now, I am still sleeping. I feel good just having barely six hours of sleep. I thought I would be feeling more tired and exhausted, but It has not hit me yet. This morning, while watching CNN, and still seeing the coverage of Princess Diana, made me sad. It makes me think why everyone in that crash died and the bodyguard did not. He had ten hours of surgery. What pain I thought. I kept on asking myself why did G-d let him live. Why not someone like Princess Diana who did so much for the world and has two young boys to help grow up. She did so much for other people. She even raffled her dresses of for charity. What a women. I'm feeling a little bit tired now. The psy experiment I did today was a fun experiment. I enjoyed it. I sat next to a cute girl. I hope today's classes will go fast. I would like to take a nap today. Just to sleep and rest for an hour. It was nice seeing one of my brothers in my fraternity on campus today. It was a nice surprise. Also, I saw one of my friends from home on campus. It is exciting walking home from campus or going a different route because of the unexpected people you see or new or old friends you see. My mother went on business and I hope she is doing well. I hope she got well rested today. I hope to talk with my sister and she how well she is doing. I try to put myself in a better mood everyday. I think about a lot of things and it gets me worried. An example is I worry about friends, family, grades, whether I am behind or don't understand something in a class. I also do not like change. I don't like a change in atmosphere or any change whatsoever. Like going home this summer was hard because of a change in atmosphere and a change in obeying my parents again with a curfew etc. I try to get along with all my fraternity brothers, but sometimes I feel it is harder than normal. I spoke with my mother and she says you can't be friends with everyone. I have so much to thank for but I feel that I am always asking G-d to help me in a situation. I enjoy life and enjoy the pleasures it gives me. I enjoy school and friends. I feel everyone has there moods and their times they feel good and bad. I had a very rough summer due to the fact that I had irritable bowel syndrome. It was very painful and I did not like the pain. A doctor prescribed me some medication. What upsets me is that one of my friends I feel is rude at times. I feel this because last night he was rude when I went to his room and he started yelling that I was disturbing his speech. I continue to be nice to him. I am always debating whether or not to be nice to him. He can be nice at times, but a jerk at other times. I feel that he maybe insecure and have no real friends. Sometimes I'm angry at him and sometimes I'm not. Sometimes I feel sorry for him and sometimes I don't. I walked into my fraternity house this morning and saw our cleaning man. The fraternity buys all his children gifts for Christmas and I think it's nice. Sometimes I feel sorry for him. He is a nice man. I also feel sad sometimes because I wish the relationship with me and my father would be better. I do not get along with him very well. Sometimes I get very upset thinking about it. I often thank G-d that I have an excellent relationship with my mother and my uncle and sister. I miss my dog. He is so cute. I didn't spend that much time with him this summer and forgot to ask my parents how he is doing. Usually I hear him barking when I am on the phone with my parents, but I have not heard him recently. When I visit home in a couple of weekends, I would like to spend a little time with him. He is a very nice and loving pet. He is old but still wild. I hope my girlfriend comes home with me. She said she would. Her father is coming up to Austin on Thursday and we are going to dinner with him. This makes me a little bit nervous, but who wouldn't be ? I think. I miss my family. They are coming up for parents weekend which should be nice. I hope to go to the football game this weekend, some of my friends drew tickets for the game already. I have not given my ID to anyone. I will call up some friends tonight and see if they want to go. Sometimes it is hard to ask my frat bros if they are going etc. Maybe I won't go to the game-- it is a good time to relax. I will see. I hope to watch Melrose Place tonight. I have a lot of homework but I hope to watch it anyway. I have a lot of reading to do and I hope I complete. I think I will or come very close to it. I sometimes do not feel 100 percent. Right now I am getting a little tired. I think I might nap after lunch. I think we are having steak today. I usually think of steak for dinner but I guess it is okay. Yesterday I read for a long time. I didn't get as much reading done as I would of liked, but I am trying to keep up and I understand most of the information in the readings. I have to buckle myself down and get my priorities straight. Maybe I won't go to the game and instead study for my classes. I would get a lot done because no one would be here. I am more tired now. I hope today's classes go fast and I have plenty of time to do work undisturbed!! I hope to see my girlfriend and not argue with her. She is truly my best friend. Guy or Female -- I think she is my best  friend. Another best friend is my friend Traylyn. He is nice and I have known him since third grade. I am probably going to pray later today. I was hoping to do it this morning but couldn't get myself to wakeup extra early to do so. ",1
974,"as I sit here to begin writing, I was stood up for a date this weekend. I know this happens all the time, but still it hurt. and I don't know why. I mean its not like I need love and attention all that much. okay, so maybe I do. but is that so bad. but it seems that everytime I find someone who does love me I find a way to push them away. I don't know. maybe I'm not meant to be happy. I really do hate being so dependant. and I don't know why I am. maybe its genetic. maybe not. maybe I'm just becoming one of those messed up people I never wanted to become. who knows. usually when I write stream of consiousness it turns very melodic and down trodden. I guess this keyboard messing up might be helping things. I don't know. I'm not really tired, but I have so much to do. and I do want to get some sleep. maybe getting dumped on some is good for me, maybe it will wake me up. maybe I am dreaming too much. maybe none of this is real, and I'm jus+t fooling myself. who knows, I surely don't. but its kinda bad being so dependant, especially when you don't attract girls by the dozen. but I can not help it, its who I am. a hopeless romantic, lost in a non romantic world. oh, for the days of the cowboys. when men were men. or medevil times, with knights, and damsels. and fuedal kingdoms. and the plauge. ring around the rosey. ugh. I hated that game as a child. but now I think its kinda fun. I dunno, I jus+t want someone to share with, to be with. maybe thats too much to ask out of every girl's best friend. sigh. I really don't want to go to work tommorrow. I mean I do okay, at it. but I'm just not annoying enough to be really good at it. plus I guess there's no incentive. I don't know if I want to go back to dallas on the first. I'm not sure if I want to go back period. don't get me wrong. I mean I miss some of the people. but I want to get past Mesquite. to move on with my life. I guess I have a lot of trouble moving on. but somtimes people jus+t make it too hard. this is a very pretty song. I may ask Mandy out. as a matter of fact, I think I will. but is it wrong??  I don't know. I'm not s+ure if I'm qualified to say. I'm not sure who is. I've done so many things that I said id never do. oh man. am I messed up??  isn't that somthing we are always asking ourselves though???  or at least it seems I am. I mean I have never loved anyone the w4ay I loved Kara, since Kara, if that makes any sense. I'm just so utterly confused at the moment. I don't know. plus I have too much to do to be w4orrying about all this. life should be so easy right now. I should be having a ball. but I'm not. and I hate it. ",0
1822,"In about 30 minutes I have to start getting ready for work. I don't want to go, but I need to make money so I can go out. My mom called me yesterday and said that my bank account was getting low and she wanted to know what I was spending it on. I was supposed to use the money for a stereo, but it's amazing how fast five hundred dollars can go in Austin. I love Austin so far. Tonight I'm going to a Corry Morrow concert. I should probably stay home and study, but I would like to meet more people in Austin too, so I'll probably still go. My mom also griped at me about how I need to study more. I just spent seven dollars today on washing clothes. This makes me mad because I can think of much better things to do with my money besides wash clothes. Four loads of clothes costs seven dollars. How ridiculous. I'm going home on Saturday because one of my friends is turning nineteen and they are having a party for him. I just went back home like two weeks ago, but I don't want to miss his birthday. I can't wait to see everyone from back home. My roommate is cooking her some Roman noodles and I can't decide if I want to eat some or not. I don't think so. I really wanted to lay out by the pool today, because I really need to get a tan, but I spent the whole day cleaning house and washing clothes. What fun! I haven't gotten any of my checks in from work yet and it's making me wonder because I have been working there for a while now and only one check so far has come in. I guess they don't realize I'm a college student and I need money as soon as possible. I really want to get a tattoo and that is probably the main reason I want my checks to start coming in. If my mom knew that I wanted a tattoo she would kill me. Oh well, I'll keep it a secret for a while, and then by the time she finds out it will have already been a long time since I got it. My roommate wants one too, but she's already talked to her mom about it. I really need to go to an audio store because my system in my car stopped working and I can't stand not having bass when I listen to music. It better get done soon. I really need to read this book for a freshmen seminar class I have. The book is pretty boring, but it's easy reading so I guess I'll survive. I'm really dreading going to work in a minute. I wish I could just skip to tonight and go out already. That just sounds so much more appealing! I have to go to the bathroom, but I guess I'm not supposed to because I have to sit here and keep typing my thoughts. My roommate has the T. V. on and it's kind of hard for me to keep my train of thought, but I guess that is the whole point to just write down everything that is going through your head. The drive home on Saturday is going to be so long, but it will be worth it I guess because it is going to be so much fun. It feels so nice to have a clean house. I just cleaned my room for the first time in about a week and it was getting pretty bad. My roommates boyfriend is sleeping right now and I have the music pretty loud. I should probably turn it down. We went out last night. We went to someone's apartment and it wasn't that fun. Oh yeah! I forgot the cops came. Good thing they weren't coming for us thought because that would have sucked if the party would have been broken up. I didn't even swim with everyone else because I didn't bring my bathing suit. I hope I remember to bring it next time because it looked really fun to sit in the hot tub. I'm fixing to pee in my pants. I wish this timer would hurry up and run out. I just took that pretest for the experimental requirement too and that had to be the longest testing thing I have ever taken. I didn't think it was ever going to end. I guess the hour and a half of credit they give you for doing it is well worth it. I'm getting pretty nervous about all the tests that are coming up. It seems like they are all during the same week. That is  going to kill me I just know it. The more I think about those tests the more I think I should probably stay home tonight. Naa! I'll just go out. I find myself saying that more and more when I really need to stay home and study. I have to do good this semester though so I can keep my scholarships. I can't remember what GPA I have to have to keep them. ",1
2355,"     I'm thinking about what I need to do before classes start again, but every time I  get started, something interrupts me or I just don't feel like doing it. I'm sitting in my  room in front of my awesome new computer listening to the 'Wicked"" soundtrack,  it's amazing. my room smelled before, but I cleaned the kitchen so now it doesn't  smell anymore. stacy just walked in my room and I yelled at her because I am not  supposed to be disturbed during my writing assignments. I'm feeling kind of gross,  actually. I feel gross because it's the end of the weekend and I was out partying  the whole time. I hate when people are like, ""yeah I party"", but I seriously did the  whole weekend. now I feel dirty and gross. I also ate like crap this whole weekend. ew. during the week I'm so healthy and so conscious of what I eat, and then the  weekend comes and it's like I've never seen food before. what is that about? so  now I feel gross because I feel like I ate the entire state of texas and I'm disgusting. I'll get over it. I kind of miss camp right now, even though I would never go back. I  miss sam israel and hilly and weisberg. those three are like my favorite people in  the world. this time seems to be going by so slowly. I feel like I've been writing  forever and I haven't. weird. so back to camp. I miss it because I was so  comfortable and so happy. here, I'm not used to everything yet. and I miss those  three girls because I know that they will always be there and I've known them  forever. I'm still getting to know people here, which is fun because I love to meet  new people, but sometimes I long for that feeling of comfort and not having to  impress or look good for anyone. you know what I mean? and I also miss adam. this is something I could talk about for a while but I don't really know if I want to. it's  our 4 year anniversary in a couple of days but the card and present that I sent him  won't get there on the 8th, I feel kind of bad about that. what can I do? it was so  weird when ross called me the other night, what the f? I'm running out of things to  talk about. I love traci, my suitemate. I knew her from camp and I'm really glad we  decided to live together. despite what everyone said, I knew it would be a good  decision. we've been getting along really well. I'm thinking about ""friends"" right  now because it's my favorite show. I love it so much, and I'm so sad that it's over. but I'm excited to watch ""joey"" on Thursday. I'm definitely going to support him even if  the show sucks, though I doubt it will. this is random but I'm going to run out of soap  and shampoo soon, I'm going to have to go to eckerd's to buy more, and I need to  return some books to the co-op outlet because there were some books that I didn't  need. hopefully I'll get store credit, and then I can buy some stuff. that would be  awesome! I need to return my chemistry and old psychology book. I found out that  I was in the chemistry class for science majors, and let me tell you that I'm the  furthest thing from a science major. I hate science. well I don't hate it but I definitely  don't belong in that class. so I switched into chemistry in context which is for sure  more my pace. and I actually swtiched into this class after classes had started and  I found out that I bought the wrong book. I just figured something out about me. I  hate bad spellers. so random, I know, but I see myself typing and every time I'm  about to spell something wrong or I mistype, I get so angry. I don't know how  people can just leave words mispelled. I hope nobody reads this because they'll  think I'm such a weird kid. which I am, but not everyone needs to know that. my  brother, danny, always tells me I'm a weird kid. he's so funny. and whenever I talk  about him to other people, they always ask how old he is, and then they are  surprised when I tell them that he's 16, because the way I talk about him, it sounds  like he's older. danny always gives me orders and bosses me around, but in a  funny way, not in a serious way. people always make fun of our family by calling  us the ""brady bunch"" because  no one ever seems to fight in my family. I don't  know why, but we all just get along. my older sister is my best friend in the entire  world. sure, we get annoyed with each other every once in  a while, but she is  absolutely the first person that I go to with a problem and she's the first person I tell  things to. and danny is awesome. there's nothing not to like about him. he's so  cute, nice, smart, funny, he's a great catch. some day, girls are going to fall all over  him. they should. me and andi (my sister) always say that we would date danny if  he wasn't our brother. he's such a cute kid. I'm kind of mad at him though because  I haven't talked to him in a really long time and he said that he would call me and  he didn't. I hate when people do that. I really don't know what else to talk about. I  guess I can go through my high school friends and talk about them because then  I'll have plenty to say. I hope that's still following the assignment. so I'll start with  olivia geyelin. I don't even know why I'm writing about her because she sucks. I  mean, I hate this girl. she might be the dumbest person I know, and she's always  complaining and never knows what's going on. she gets mad at everyone for the  dumbest reasons. ew. but I kind of feel bad for her because she's got the worst  family life ever. ok I'm sick of olivia, now I'll talk about rikki spreckman. ok, I used to  love rikki, she was so sweet and nice and always smiling. and then I realized how  selfish and dumb she was. I hate sounding like a bitch but I' m starting with the  people I like the least and working my way to the good ones. ok so rikki, sweet girl,  adorable, but so dumb. and she's best friends with hillary, who I'll come back to  later, but it annoys me because hillary's one of my best friends and I hate how  much time they spend together. I'm not jealous, I just know that hillary could do so  much better than rikki, but rikki seems to need hillary. and I feel bad for hill  because a lot of people don't like rikki, and so they're always talking about her and  then people assume that because hill is so close with her that she sucks too,  which is so not true. but I've known rikki since junior high. ok now on to sarah  salon. I used to hate sarah. she's a bitch. not kidding. and she's intimidating as  hell, but only if you take her seriously. now I like her a lot more because I'm not  scared of her and I don't take her shit. she has two older sisters who might be the  meanest people ever, and she tries to act like them but she's so much better than  them. sarah had a boyfriend for a really long time, and so her and I were always  able to have really great conversations about boiyfriends and relationships. she's  always so much fun to be around. I like her. but her and rikki had this whole feud  going for a while and all she would do was talk about rikki and how much she  hated her. I'm wondering if this timing thing is accurate because I really feel like  I've been doing this forever and every time I'm typing, it seems like the seconds  don't go by, but every time I pause, the seconds go by quickly. maybe it's in my  head, I don't know. but it's weird. I'm going to start looking at another clock to see  how much time has gone by. ok after sarah, I only have favorites left. everyone  else left, I genuinely love, they're my best friends. I'll start with lizzie albert. Elizabeth Chandler Albert. I met lizzie freshman year and we were instantly best  friends. I'm not kidding, I loved her so much and we could always talk about  anything and laughed so much together it was ridiculous. and we were always on  the same intellectual level because we were pretty much the same (but she was  smarter). in our group of friends, we were the smartest. we were bff, I swear and  then junior year, our friends kind of got in this fight and we didn't talk for a really  long time. it really bothered me. I'm not joking. it killed me that she didn't want to  talk to me and I didn't understand. it was so bad. we were never the same again. but at the end of senior year, we got close again, and now I think we're really  close, like reverting back to three years ago. I miss her so much, she goes to  wisconsin. she's probably having the best time. I can't wait to go visit her. she's so  funny, I always have a great time whenever I'm with her. Love her. ok after lizzie  comes simone. I met simone actually a long time ago. Maybe in 1997. she came  to camp and we were good friends, we were in the same cabin. then she stopped  going to camp and I didn't see her again until I was in high school. then we  became best friends. I LOVE simone. she cracks me up and is so great. we finish  each other's sentences, she reminds me of my mom so much, she's like another  sister to me. we took this class together called 20th century history and literature,  and it was the best class that I have ever taken. I'm so glad that we were able to be  in that class together. I hate sounding cheesy but it's true. there's no one I'd rather  be in 20th with than simone. simone's dad died the day before her 5th birthday,  and so she lives with her mom. she has two sisters, so the four girls are pretty  close. her mom works all the time so I feel like simone's ahead of all of us, she's  already an adult. she does things by herself and is really mature. love her. she  goes to bradley which is so good for her. I really hope she's happy. she rocks my  world. after simone comes marisa. LOVE marisa. we always knew each other but  weren't really friends until about sophomore year. then the end of junior year and  all of senior year we were like inseperable. we were best friends. me, simone,  lizzie and marisa were a foursome. she's so funny, so sweet, loooooves to talk. I  love her family and going over to her house because I always have a good time  when I'm there. marisa was the kid who was on the fast track, if you know what I  mean. she had sex when she was 12 or 13, had a cell phone before everyone,  never really had any rules. Which the exact opposite of me. but she's great and I  love her. she has parties and her house is always the one we go back to after  dances and stuff. marisa and I went to breakfast every Saturday morning of our  senior year. that makes me so sad that I don't get to do that anymore. she goes to  indiana, and she loves it. both her parents went there and loved it. her mom was  president of aephi there, so she won't have any problems getting into the sorority. marisa goes with the flow, she's not uptight or anal about much. she's actually  underrated anal but I won't tell anyone about that. love her. and last, I'll talk about  Hillary. I love her. I've known her since the early days at camp marimeta. she was  always the little girl that everybody loved. we didn't become friends until we were  older and then became like best friends junior and senior year. she' so great. I  honestly love her and miss her so much. she wanted to go here so badly and  didn't get in. Ass holes. but I don't think she would have come here anyways. I can  talk to hillary about everything. I love her. she goes to illinois. I can't wait to go visit  her. she's so fun and we'll have the best time partying, but I also can't wait to just  talk with her and lay on her bed. she's so funny and a great person to be with. we're very similar in a lot of ways and I just think that she's great. the first time I  came to visit texas she came with me. and we were on poms together. She was  even my big sister one year. I miss poms. and I miss hill, I need to call her actually  because I miss her so much. she's so cute and so talented. she's the best dancer  ever and she has a really great voice but she doesn't really sing anymore. sometimes I make her sing to me, but she doesn't sing for a lot of people. ok so  now that I only have about a minute left I can talk about adam. adam jeffrey silver. I  met the kid the first day of high school. I was like, damn he's hot. we were in like 3  classes together and our last names are close so we sat next to each other. we  exchanged phone numbers, he asked me to homecoming and we dated ever  since. he's my best friend in the entire world. he knows me better than even I know  myself and more than my sister knows me. he's so special to me and I know that  I'm in love with him and that I will always love him. I miss him so much. sometimes  I don't' know what to do with myself because I miss him so much but I know it's the  right thing to be with other people right now. how else are we supposed to know if  we're really right for each other? this is the time to find out , you know? well, it's  been great. see you later ",1
1667,"     Just as i moved to this page my roomate came into our apartment and it appears that he has brought some food back from the grocery store. That is always a good thing. Now I'm thinking about how I can possibilly type my thoughts for this amount of time with out taking a break for some snacks and whatnot. Today has felt like the longest day that I can remember and I can't figure out why. When I was in my math class at 11 in the morning I for some reason it felt to me as if it was 5 in the evening. Now I am listening to the tv in the background and amthinking about how much I disagree with the news man. What is going to be typed by me in 5 minutes from now is flooding me with curiosity. I hope that this week goes by much faster then it is right now. I can't wait until Texas plays North Carolina this Saturday. Horns football is one of the top three reasons why I applied to The University of Texas and I am very glad that I got in. Now I am looking at a picture of the roadrunner from wiley cyotte however you spell it and it makes me think of apples and oragnges. That kind of scares me that random things like that just kind of pop up into my head, but oh well. Now I am wishing that I had started some music to play as a was writing this because I am almost always interested in listening to music. Yes my roomate is talking to me and he didnt know that I was home this entire time what a silly bastard. Now I am listening to Whiteny Houston who is a supposed crack head butthat doesn't really bother me because she can sing ok. I wonder how many times she does crack cocaine a day or use too. Sometimes I wonder what it feels like to be high on coke but I have never tried it. The reasons I haven't done coke is probably because most people I know that do coke are lost causes. My roomate thinks I'm an alcoholic because he heard me say I was drinking punch and I am but he thought it was trashcan punch which means his mind was on alcohol so maybe he is the alcoholic. I am not excited about having to go to three classes today because I am so very tired that I could easily take a nap and enjoy it a 100 times more. I have about 4. 25 minutes left, that makes me think about how much faster this writing assignment has gone thean I thought it would. What my life will be like 8 months from now is a random thought that just entered my mind. I wonder if I will still have my girlfriend, and I hope I do and I wonder if I will be less depressed than I am right now because at the moment I am at a time where very little makes me happy and I really didn't have that problem at all over the summer unless I was thinking about school again. I don't know exactly why but school changes my state of mind dramatically and quickly. I know I should be thankful to even go to school but how can I help the feelings that I have. now there are three two oh times up. ",0
1921,"Okay. this keyboard is weird. the buttons are all flat and wide and the mouse is part of the laptop. ergh this is going to be hard to get used to. why does Dell make their E crooked? Does it make it look cool to them?  Ugh. I have to stop backspacing that's not the point of this thing. ooh. someone's on their I'M. I haven't talked to Radhika in about 4 days. I wonder if she is annoyed that I still call at least twice a week. I need to get out more . I've only made 2 friends since I've been here. well not really, I guess Jaime and that weird girl across the hall from Michelle count. I haven't started getting friendly with anyone in any of my classes and that's going to bad when, my foot is asleep. studying crap needs to get done. Why does Brynn always sleep. I have to walk on eggshells if she is constantly napping. isn't the 20 minutes up yet?  This is taking forever and my hands are colder I wonder if that saying about guys being turned on when their hands are cold is true. This chair's uncomfortable. At least I organized my junk some. I need to buy paper towels next time I go to the store. I'm kind of hungry but I've already had about 700 calories today. these keys are so weird. I keep missing letters because they're not where they're supposed to be. good I wrote the right type of they're and not their. I hate when people mix up their spellings. I probably did in this thing. I hope no one reads it. I have nothing of substance ever going on in my head. I like the clicky noises the laptop makes. I wonder if I'll be able to connect wirelessly now that I bought that card thing. I'll have to find those place things where wireless can be used. I bet the school lied about them being almost everywhere. wankers. ugh I keep hitting the mouse thing. it'll take forever to get used to this thing. 9 and a half minutes to go. come oonnnnn. I don't want to do this anymore. at least I won't have to do a research paper for this class. and the writing seems to be easy so far. My shoulders hurt and my fingers are still cold. Will these people please stop loitering in front of our door. so freaking rude. Now the pain's spreading to my neck. I need a break . wonder if I'm getting carpel tunnel Not again. Damn computer. why did I want a laptop so much. not worth it. stupid Dell . need to stretch. 7 minutes. I have to do French after this. why is that class taking up so much of my time. I need more free time. why can't it be like it was the first week that was nice. Why does. oh crap this is showing up on-line. people are going to read this. What kind of loser would waste their time doing that. I sure as hell don't have time for anything much more than homework and trying to get in a nap somewhere. How can people sleep on the grass? Don't bugs fly in their ears and noses. don't they worry about the sun damage they're. am I the only one around here who uses sun block. why am I only writing in question form?  stop. stop. thinking about my fingers which are still cold and pretty dry looking. Now what was that? What are you doing computer don't disconnect my I'M! Damn you, I didn't tell you to do that. piece of crap. Still hungry maybe I can type and reach over for a granola bar at once. Do circus people ever get bored entertaining ungrateful idiots?  Do PeTA and those SpCA people check up on them to make sure they don't mistreat the tigers and elephants and stuff. Oh almost done thank you. woohooo!  Continue writing my butt! ",0
2417,"     Right now I am sitting here. The washing machine is very loud. My nose is  really stuffy. I really like that band brandston that I saw the othernight. they were  really nice and really cool. I can't wait until I get to hang out with steven. I really  missed him while I was in austin. stupid nose itches. I don't understand why randi  and I seem to not be as close anymore. Its kind of sad. She has been my best  friend for 5 years. Its really ironic that steven is now my best friend. who would  have ever thought? ""Don't come crying back to me. When you're lonely and all out  of love"" is a song lyric from brandston that is going through my head constantly  causing me right now to basically only be able to think about that one specific  song. Its a very nice song. Very simple, yet it manages to me a very interesting. I  can't believe that I still have 17 minutes left to type. Its usually very hard for me to  type stream of consciousnes, I've tried it before in a humanities class for some  reason. I can't ever seem to really put what I'm thinking on paper. that's why its  hard for me to write or keep a journal. I even lie to myself on paper. I wonder why. I also wonder why Mikey is the way he is with me. I can't believe I ran into him last  night. He completely ignored me. That really hurts my feelings because we were  really close. At least I thought so. I really need closure. I hate myself for not  hating him. My nose is running again now. It's getting in the way of my typing. I  am so stressed out right now about biology. The house is completely silent right  now except for the washing machine. The dorm is never this quiet. I think maybe  that's why I like the dorm. Because its loud. Ow, I just hit my ear that I just pierced. Its really sore. The pain only lasts for a split second though. Its not as hot here in  amarillo as it is in austin. the weather here for labor day is perfect. I think I will go  and walk my dogs. I just sneezed again. I am sick of sneezing. Stupid allergies. I  need to print my chemistry notes and my chemistry homework. I also need to read  chapters 3 and 4 for psychology. I am behind. I am so worried about my  biology. I don't understand it and because of that I am not focusing as hard on my  other classes. However, government should be easy. I've taken that class before. Psychology is fun, but I really do not know what to expect on my tests. I don't know  how I will do in that class. I thought chemistry was easy, but apparently it isn't easy  at all. someone is getting ice from the refrigerator. I can hear it. wow, does my  mind really jump this much?  that's really interesting. I guess I am sort of truly  typing in a stream of consciencous. am I even spelling that right?  I usually can  spell. I feel like everyone else at UT is smarter than I am. I am not used to that.  I'm always the smartest. No one here knows my reputation. no one knows that I  am smart. But maybe I'm not smart. Maybe I am just lucky. My little puppy shinobi  isn't eating anymore. Maybe its because of his shots he got yesterday. I really  missed my dogs. zeb was very loving yesterday when he saw me. He licked me  all over. I love dogs so much. but its ironic because my dogs aren't normal and don't  show me the same amount of love dogs usually show people. other dogs like me  more. just my luck. I had to explain what I am doing to my mom. this is all  interesting. the fan is on now. my legs are cold. I think I'm sick. I want to listen to  my new cd again. I can't believe that I got to talk to further seems forever and get  put on the guest list for another show of theirs. too bad I didn't go. I can't believe  mikey thought they were terrible when he saw them. oh well, he is probably just  tying to be ""emo"" and all cool and is just saying that to be different and to fit in with  the people  that he holds up on a pedestool. why did I ever date a guy like that?  and why am I still so attracted to such a stupid jerk?  I hate people like him. why  has he changed?  my stomach is hurting now again. I don't like being sick. I need  paper in order to print. and a USB cable. I hate that my printer doesn't work in my  dorm. I brought it for nothing. I bought some new cartridge too. its all a waste. I  can't return it. well for thanksgiving or something I will bring the printer home and  have my dad try to fix it. being home doesn't feel like home really. just feels like I'm  visiting. which is really what I'm doing. my nose is itching again, I think I am going  to sneeze again. I feel like I've been typing for 2 hours. someone just opened  something. I don't hear my dogs anymore. I wonder what they are doing. my  stomach is still hurting. the air conditioner just turned on. I heard it. I don't usually  hear these things. that's strange. my eyes are drooping. I'm tired. I haven't slept  well for a couple days. Why does he hate me?  I really wish I would just be brave  and confront him. I always say I'm going to, and I really think that I am going to, but  then I chicken out and if anything, I am extremely nice to him only to have him  ignore me. further seems forever was so good the other night. the energy  around me at the concert was so good. I was up in front. that was great. the new  lead singer was great. I need to go to more places like that in austin. I just typed  that sentence with my eyes closed. I am really falling asleep. my parents are  talking. I can hear them. my dad is selling my car. that makes me sad because I  really like my car. Even though I am getting a better car. ",0
642,"Why do I always analyze things to the point that I completely stress myself out about it?  I find myself doing this time and time again.   I feel stupid, I can't believe that I let Jaime set me up on a date with someone that I don't even know. To top that, I barely know her. What was I thinking? The way that she is talking, he is the most gorgeous guy she's ever seen; however, I am really scared that I am going to be really let down. I know that sounds really negative, but I guess it sounds too good to be true. It doesn't make sense to me how this whole thing works anyways. Your sorority tells you about a party that they are having, giving you only two days notice to find a date. To me that is completely weird. I just don't have the guts to go up to some random guy and ask him to go to something that I'm not even sure will be fun myself. Oh well, it will all work out.   Now, on the other hand, I'm all about going to the pledge line tomorrow. I couldn't believe that someone asked me. It made me feel so good inside to know that I was one of the few girls to get asked!    I don't know what my problem is; it just seems like I can't stop thinking about how much weight I think that I need to lose. It seems to be the only thing that I think about any more, and I don't know why. I don't think that there is anything wrong with me, but then again, maybe there is . You never can tell any more.   All I know is that there are so many things going on and not enough time. I wish that my body wouldn't go through such big ""swings"". One minute I am bursting with energy, and the next I can't even keep my eyes open. It is as if a person is holding onto my heels and making me drag them for hours on end. After dragging them for so long, you just can't drag any more. This tiredness that sweeps over me comes frequently throughout the day, but , without fail, it comes each day between 2pm and 5pm. I want to be like others that are comstantly energetic, skinny, and seem to get everthing done with no problems at all. I guess that is only a perception in my mind that only sees things from the outside instead of how they really are. Does that make sense?     Why can't there be more hours in the day. I feel like ever since I have gotten here, all the time in my day has flown by, and comtinues to fly by without even slowing down. Which is fine with me as long as I don't leace things that are really important to me out. Unfortunately, this is what I have been forced to do because I my new schedule.    Before I came to school, I worked out daily so that I could relieve all of my stess, and feel good all at the same time. Now I can't even find time to get to class--much less work out.   I wonder how Nolan is. Is such a sweet little boy. Ever since he was born I have loved those kids, and had a compassion for them that no one else could ever have.    I can't believe that Catrina came up to me and asked me about Ryan Murphy the other day. I mean talk about digging up painful things that have already been buried!! Whenever she said something, every bit of hurt and anger inside of me came back like it was just yesterday that it had happened.   I need to put it past, and forgive and forget. That is at least what I know I am supposed to do, but it is so hard! Why do I get attached to people so easily? That is one thing even I will never know. ",1
1211,"Today has been one of the longest days of my life. I have had only one class today so I am constantly looking for some way to spend my time. It seems that everyone I know here on campus is in class or at work, therefore I am left alone with nothing to do. When I sit there with nothing to do I become very homesick. If it were not for my Friday classes I would be long gone. It excites me however, that tomorrow I get to go home. I can't wait to be in my own house without a roommate or doors slamming through the night. One thing that I can't wait to see is my cousins. They are adorable. The oldest, Sydney, is like the sister I never had despite the fact that she is only nine years old. I enjoy being around her and it makes me proud when she comes to me to ask personal questions. I have three other cousins too. Leizl, who is five, is so cute and has such a wild imagination. It excites me to watch her imagination at work. She is one of the very few children left in this world that can entertain herself for hours with a paper towel roll. Next is Will, the little man. He is only two and is constantly making me laugh. He is in love with Blues Clues and Power Puff girls. He knows every word to the songs and has his own little dance for each of them too. The youngest, and I have to say my favorite, is little Miss Annie Makenna. She turned one on August 30. The reason that I think I like her the most or think about her the most is the fact that we almost lost her. She was born with the strep virus in her lungs and spent the first month of her life in the ICU on a lung machine. She is now a healthy little girl. She is now walking but it seems so weird to see her walk because she is only the size of a 6 month old. She is so tiny. I can't wait to see them. They are the world to me and I love them and miss them everyday. Just as I do my parents and my brother. That is on thing that gets me down about college. I don't like being away from my family. I love them dearly. They mean everything to me. Writing this paper has depressed me but I know that tomorrow I will get to see them all and spend the entire weekend with them. Yeah! My brother is cool. I am one of the very few girls in this world that got blessed with an awesome older brother. He is three years older than me and he has always been there for me, much like my two loving parents. I thank God everyday for the family that he has given me and the support he has surrounded me with. ",0
311,"today if the first Sunday that I have been here alone and it is interesting because I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t have my parents looking over my shoulder telling me what to do. I can just walk out of my room and go have a cigarette. this is different because before I would have to think up an excuse to go and have one. my feet are cold right now and I need to take a shower. I didn't get up till about 11:45. the MTV music video awards and not very exciting and I am tired of listening to all of these peoples memories about their favorite moments. they, the awards are just a simple kind of propaganda. Michael Jackson does like little boys and should stop trying to cover it up with all those insignificant women. the only reason he wants children are for the obvious. it sucks he has that kind of problem. many people do like to eat corn but they donÃ¯Â¿Â½t seem to serve it here in the jester cafeteria. I wonder if this is going to get through because I cant even send my mom an email. it would suck if it didn't. this is the largest class I have ever been in. I hope it is the most interesting. I need to check how much money is in my account. I came with alot and am still wondering how much I will leave with. Dana Carvey is a funny guy and I figure he had a bad childhood because his brother is a bearded man who rarely says a word. I miss running track. I need to go and workout but will when IÃ¯Â¿Â½m done. Hanson is the most ridiculous group in the whole world. if they can make it I know that I can. I am really infatuated with this girl and hope that I run into her again, actually there are two that I am. Eddie Murphy is a pimp. I cant believe that princess Diana died. I think that she staged her own death to get away from the photographers. she had been harassed her whole life and would have and could have been driven to such extremes. I do not know how long I've been writing but will keep writing for another ten minutes. I feel like Beavis and butthead because I am verbalizing all of my thoughts. I stayed up till three oÃ¯Â¿Â½clock last night and still slept nine hours. the song by Aerosmith, dude look like a lady, is it about a homosexual or a crossdresser. is cross dresser one or two words. I still think that notorious b. i. g. and tupac are still alive. I need to get the c. d. tom petty and the heart breakers greatest hits because I miss listening to them. I still seems I havenÃ¯Â¿Â½t written that much. van halen is so cool, not. this is ridiculous my thoughts. Daisy fuentes is hot and IÃ¯Â¿Â½m glad that she is not bald. what is Marilyn masons deal ?>????. he is a freak and I had the pleasure of meeting him and his band in the theatre. he was busy throwing gummy worms at the people attempting to watch star wars. he reminded me of a lost child. maybe thatÃ¯Â¿Â½s why he dresses like he does. he is a freak. the chocolate milk in the cafeteria is good. I kind of want to go to breakfast tomorrow because I have never eaten in the morning in the cafeteria. I have done absolutely nothing today and I thoroughly like it. I do need to go and take a shower because that would be proper. I wonder how many people only take showers every other day. I wonder if commercials actually do influence the ways people buy products. that's it has been twenty minutes. ",1
351,"I am completely computer illiterate and I never trust them. I have a lot of reading to catch up on and I am worried that I will not have enough time this week. A bunch of my friends and I are flying to Los Angeles on Friday morning for the UCLA vs. UT football game. We are only staying until Sunday evening but that takes away an entire weekend. I should probably bring some of my books with me on the airplane because I think it's about a four hour flight. I am also mad at myself because I took a really long nap today which wasted a lot of time. I think I really needed to catch up on my sleep though from this weekend. We stayed up really late after the game on Saturday and then I woke up early on Sunday to drive to Houston. I went in town to visit my family because I missed them and hadn't been home in a while. We went out to dinner on Sunday evening and then went to look at my Dad's new office. He just moved, it's a little bit smaller than his old one but he doesn't have a partner any more so he doesn't need as much space. Well, now I'm off to try to get on to the Pretesting page.   ",0
548,"Entering a big campus with so many different people, how interesting. This will be kind of a new experience, meeting other students just as smart or even smarter. I can bring ideas to this school and to others as well as the school and students to me. Hopefully, I do well, or excel beyond my potential where I can feel proud and to just prove my abilities to myself. Things now are a little different, where I live, what I eat, who I meet. But it seems that everybody has to deal with the same things or hurdles in that everybody are fighting, scratching, or just competing to be the best or is everybody just content to making to college?  Due to their being content, the race for those competing will be easier for them, but are we in a rat race to achieve greatness?  There are also other things in life other thatn to prove that one person is somehow better academically because of a test made by some professor and to the subjects covered by what the professor says, there's to find leisure time when not having to study. School can be easily sluffed off, but students are paying for classes in which makes a person certified to do a job in which that person studied. Money don't grow on trees; people gots to earn it, to feel good about oneself. But it's also the little things that can a person feel good like just getting together with friends and talking, to eat something that's very tasteful, to just observe how folks interact with certain situations and how watching or observing these things can help me without me having to go through, but somethimes some things have to experienced by oneself to fully understand. Things aren't what they always seem just by loooking. College has too much to offer, where everything arent' feasible to understand, and just let things be. ",0
1748,"     I thought that this writing assignment was going to be difficult, but it's actually not that bad. Actually, I kind of like it. It's kind of like writing a diary or journal. I feel hungry right now and am wondering what I am going to eat for lunch. I am tired of eating the same food at Jester again. The food there is always the same: pizza, chicken, burgers, etc. I can't wait until I go home to Dallas this afternoon and eat some real authentic vietnamese food. I miss my mom's cooking. Just a few more hours and I'll be on my way back to Dallas. I can't wait!  I miss my boyfriend so much. His birthday's coming up and I still need to get him a present. I don't know what to get him. It's hard for me because I don't have a car at UT. I wondering what he's doing right now can't wait to see his face. My friend just burned a new DJ cd that just released and some of the songs are actually ok but a lot of it is not that good. I miss my family. Its funny how when I'm at home I wish that I was away from home because my family tend to annoy and get on my nerves at time, but when I'm actually away I wish I was home. My roommate just finished talking to this guy she's dating. He calls her a lot. It's funny because that's how it was with me and my boyfriend when we were 'talking. '  He would call me all the time. My friends are studying in my dorm right now. I feel so lazy. I'm behind in a lot of classes and I havn't been doing a lot of studying this week. I need to push myself to study before I screw up my GPA again. Speaking of school, it's only my second year in college and I wish that it would over. I mean I like college and all like the friends you meet, the parties, and the school spirit. I just hate classes and studying. My friend is singing right now and it's so hilarious because he has a monotone voice and when he sings you can't tell that he has a monotone voice and when he sings its like he gives it his all. Its so funny. By the way the DJ cd that we burned is called DJ Prada G. It's like the DJ is trying to make his name unique like making it sound like 'prodigy' but spelled differently. Hmmm. Twenty minutes sure is going by slow. I have an ortho appointment this Monday so I'm going to miss calculus which is'nt too bad because I can borrow the notes from my friend. I need to go shopping this weekend; I am so out of clothes to wear. Five more minutes. This assignment isn't too bad. When are we going to eat?  I need to start packing. I am such a procrastinator, I wait till the last minute for everything. I need to stop that. I wondering what my boyfriend's friends are going to do for his birthday this weekend. I have a feeling that they are going to get him drunk. We are about to leave for Dallas soon since one of my friends decided not to go, so we don't have to wait for her. When are we going to eat?

306,"Wow, I really don't know what to write. All I know is that I'm kinda behind on  my studies. The bad thing is that it's only been the first couple weeks of  school. I know I shouldn't procrastinate like this, but I just can't seem to help it.  That's why I'm doing this assignment at the last minute. Bad, huh?   Hummmmm, this chair is kinda uncomfortable. I just took  a shower and my hair is still kinda damp. I have really long hair, so it takes quite awhile for it to dry completely. I really miss my boyfriend. The funny thing (at least it's funny to me is that I'm Vietnamese and my boyfriend is black. Well his father is black and his mom is half Arabic and half French. My boyfriend,  Mohamed, was born in Africa but moved to Paris when he was only one years old. He's lived there for the past 18 years or so and have been here in the U. S for only two  years. He speaks five different languages. Pretty impressive, huh?  I have no idea why he hasn't called me yet. I haven't seen him in two weeks. I miss him sooo much. I wonder if he misses me or not. What do you think?  My problem is that  I'm not calling him until he calls me first. That's just the way I am. The guy always has to make the first move. I guess if he really wants to talk to me or hear my voice, then he will sooner or later pick up the phone. I really hope he will call soon. I really, really miss him. I guess it has to do with the fact that he is my very first boyfriend. If my parents ever find out I'm seeing a black guy, they would absolutely FREAK!  That's how they are. Actually, that's how  I kinda was. I told myself I would never ever like anyone but Asian guys. Boy, was I wrong. You know what, my arms are kinda getting tired now. For some  reason, I'm sitting real straight up in my seat. I never do this when I'm just  typing for the heck of it. Maybe the fact that I know this is for a grade makes  me a bit uneasy. Oh well, I don't mind. There, I kinda sat back a bit and it  feels a little bit better now. I just yawned. great, I need to stay up kinda  late tonight to do some other homework. I have ten more minutes but I don't know what else to write. I guess I type kinda fast, and so it seems as though I'm  writing a whole lot, huh?  I don't know how you are going to grade this. I know  it's gonna be a completion grade, but how are we going to benefit from this. I  bet you're just making us do this so whenever you don't have anything to do, you can just pull these up and give yourself a good laugh at our expense, huh?  NO, I'm just kidding. . Oh, Oh, OH, OH, yeah, yeah. I love you more than I can say. , I'll love you twice as much tomorrow, Oh, OH, I love you more than I can say. OH, don't you know I  need you so, OH tell me please, I gotta know. Do you mean to make me cry?  Am I just another gal,  That was just a song that I usually sing when my mind has nothing else on it. How do you like it?  It's kinda funny how sometimes I think of myself as pretty decent looking and at other times, I think I'm the ugliest troll. Why is that?  One day I would have complete confidence in myself and the next day I would feel so small and vulnerable. Why is it kinda weird for me to meet guys, especially Asian guys. Well, I kinda know the answer to that question. Since I'm Asian and I want to meet an Asian guy, I tend to feel more self conscience when I'm  around them and that results in a behavior that's not really mw. I've noticed lately that most of my guy friends are white guys. Because I don't really see them as a potential romance interest, I am very relaxed and calm with them, and I guess we just click like that. I know I should do the same with Asian guys, but it's hard just b/c they're Asian, also. Why is it so complicate, man?  Well, tomorrow, my friend Cheryl and I are gonna take a bus to the mall. I've only been on the  bus twice here around campus. I've never taken a bus on a highway before. I  have a feeling it's gonna be quite an experience for the both of us tomorrow. Wish me luck. Man, my whole arm is aching now!!!! Isn't that weird?  Okay, I'm gonna stop Bye-bye. . . . . . . . . .              ",0
287,"Boy am I hungry right about now. I sure do miss mom's cooking, even though the whole eighteen years I've been eating it, I thought it was gross. Computer are cool. Internet is awesome. I like being a guinea pig for psychology class. Jester food stinks. Man I really hate it. However, the pizzas okay. Wu tang is cool. I wish I hadn't lost the CD. Racquet ball looks interesting. I want to play intramural Basketball. I wish I had a Car. I wouldn't mind having an S-Class Benz. Is twenty minutes over yet?  Guess not. I love UT. I love                                        Bevo. I don't really miss Houston that much. I could live here forever. Man, I'm hungry. I could go for some fried chicken and biscuits with mashed potatoes and gravy. I wouldn't mind have some Cajun rice with that. I want to go  jogging,  but I have too much too read tonight. I should not have registered  for morning classes. It sucks having to wake up at eight in the morning and  dragging myself to class. Wow it has been exactly ten minutes. Apples are good when they are crunchy and sweet. I miss Houston Radio stations. I can't seem to find a good club station in Austin. I miss the clubs at Houston. However, the ones here in Austin Aren't that bad. Corn dogs at Jester are nasty. So far  my classes have been easy, but I haven't had an exam yet or even a quiz. I  don't know what to expect. I had a weird dream last night. I was at a party and every one who was there was a person I had met but not really was good  friends with. However I did not feel uncomfortable,  I even felt like I had  known them my whole life. I like Cajun rice. Red beans and rice is good too. I feel like getting something to eat. I'm starving. My stomach is telling me  to run to the fridge, but my mind is reminding me that it is just empty. All I have to eat is ice cubes I made last night. Man, I'm starving!!!   ",0
2369,"It seems like everyone has gone home for Labor Day weekend. Lunch was really uncrowded but the food was good. We had grilled chicken and mashed potatoes. I really don't normally like mashed potatoes but I always just get them anyway. A couple people started playing Coldplay on the piano which was obviously in the wrong key. Procrastination is the worst thing to do when writing a paper for a class. The more you think about it, the more unflowing the paper will be. This dorm room must have thin walls because we can hear everyone thing that is said around us. At night, we can hear all the people coming and going through the main entrance. They tend to yell and be extremely loud. Our room is due to be cleaned tomorrow. It would have been done today, but all of the workers for the dorm have the day off. There are so many more months before the semester is over!  I'm sure it will go quickly though. Twenty minutes seems like a long time right now. I still have to go to Wal-Mart today because we're completely out of snacks in the room. I'm also out of pepsi which is a must for me. Our cafeteria only serves tea, water, coffee, and punch. I've been watching way too much of ""The Real World"" in the past two days. They've been playing reruns nonstop since like Wednesday. This week is going to be a lot less stressful than last week because Monday and Wednesday are my busy days. I want to get out of the city next weekend. Maybe I'll go visit some friends at Texas State or go to the lake. I haven't been swimming in really long time. I remember swimming in my neighbors pool as a kid more than I remember swimming in my own pool. Maybe because it was more exciting since my family didn't have one at the time. Our dog would always run around the pool and bark at every splash we would make. The trees in our backyard would always have bees buzzing around it but I never once got stung. The lotion sitting on my desk is about to fall over but that's ok because nothing can spill out. Well maybe twenty minutes isn't a long time because I'm over half way done. The game on Saturday was really fun. Once the sun went down it was much more enjoyable. UNT didn't do very well. I almost went there instead of UT just because its close to home and my sisters went there. On the other hand, it was maybe a little too close to home. I don't know why I bought a thesaurus and dictionary for college when I have a computer sitting right in front of me. Its about twice as fast to look up a word on google than it is to look it up in a book. I hear a lawnmower outside. I feel sorry for whoever has to do gardening on Labor Day. My neck is starting to hurt from staring at the computer screen for so long. I should trim my fingernails. They keep getting in the way while I'm typing. I haven't seem a movie since I came to Austin. I don't even know where a movie theater is around here. Better yet, I don't know what is playing right now. I haven't seen any previews either. Someone must be sick because I keep hearing coughing coming from the hallway. People go out way too much. I can't go out on a school night without feeling badly. I always want to wait for the weekend. I'm sure that will change shortly though. This has been a very long weekend. I  think I'm actually ready for school to start again tomorrow.      ",0

I only had two classes (Calculus and my favorite class with my favorite professor Mr. Pennebaker, who is an inspiration to me and an overall wonderful, smart, and funny guy). Do I get an A?  Anyway, my friend and I are waiting until about 11 pm so we can go to Blockbuster to buy ""Titanic. ""  Yes, we're crazy girls.

I told her ""No. ""  She is trying out for rowing and another girl said that there are a lot of lesbians that are on the team. It grosses her out, but she's still curious and thinks it might not be that bad. I think it's perfectly normal, especially in college, to be curious about those kind of things. I am. How many movies have they made about college kids trying out new stuff?  Now is the perfect time to explore our sexuality. It does bother me that she thinks she will ""turn into"" a lesbian without her consent. Is that even possible?  I don't think it is. Some people say that you're born gay and that it's not their fault. I don't know. I wish I did, but I don't. I guess I'll just have to see what happens.     ",0
2104,"Right now I just sat down to type this psychology paper. This is the first time I have ever typed a paper like this before, with constant writing. I am used to gathering my thoughts, thinking before I speak but now I am writing whatever pops into my mind. I am thinking about how much this different from something I would do in high school; being able to submit a paper via the internet that is amazing. I am hearing the faint sound of the Houston Astros baseball game in the background, I love baseball so much, this the pennant races are incredible. Hopefully I will  get to broadcast the game I love in the future. Well I have an hour until its time to go to work, its nice that the clock is ticking down on my first major writing assignment of college. Astros, I think still losing 3-2 someone just flied out. I'm enjoying the fact that I am able to do this from my own computer, god I would hate to live in a dorm. Sharing and small places are no fun for me. Looking forward to this weekend, big barbecue put on by my friend Mike; we always have legendary times at those. Its just starting to sink in now as I hear God Bless America in the background that today is September 11. It's hard to believe that our country was attacked only two years ago, it seems at least to me that it happened an eternity ago. I really don't agree with what is going on in our country right now, by the way. The wind is blowing pretty good outside right now, for some reason I have not opened the blinds in the house yet. I get really lazy when I am at home. Anyway, this a little easier than I thought it would be. It has really gotten me thinking. I mean how often do we really pay attention to what we are thinking, and are we thinking about something all the time? Consciously? Well I think we got our lead off man on in the 8th we are still down 3-2, I really hope we don't lose to Milwaukee. Man I don't want to go to work today, although 4-9:30 is not that bad, better than 12-9:30. I feel like I am writing in a journal more than doing a project, that is cool that there is actually a clock at the top of the page. Big props to the person who set that up. I was actually considering putting a stopwatch next to me for this assignment, but I quickly realized that was not necessary. I just found out I have discussion section class for geography. I don't get that if you understand the material why do you need a discussion section? I don't get what that is all about, is it for the TA's to feel important or something? Must be a college thing, I guess. It seems like a lot of this stuff is over my head right now. I just quickly glanced at the clock and saw that I have about a minute left. I hope I did alright on this, I mean I wrote what came into my head and luckily avoided any sick and twisted thoughts. P. S (I submitted the paper erroneously earlier today under the wrong class code. My class code is 316 not 315) ",1
2281,"ok so I'm doing this stream of consciousness writing thing and its a little weird, but then again I love to type and just let loose on the computer what my mind is thinking. so this is kind of fun. I just wish that my strep throat/tonsillitis would go away so that tomorrow (Thursday) I can do well in the challenge. and so that I can play well for the clarinet sectional Friday night, because I need to pass off the pregame music by memory and personally, I haven't memorized all of it yet. I guess it comes from being an alternate, because half the time we practiced pregame (which hasn't been much) I was forced to sit on the sidelines and watch. oh boy, don't I love watching. I really hate just sitting there as an alternate, because I feel like I'm a cheap addition to the band. like I wasn't quite good enough to deserve a marching spot. but on the flip side, they must think that I'm good enough because I'm expected to jump in on game day and march pregame if someone is sick, late, drunk, or too hungover to march. I feel bad for thinking this but I kind of want Kelvin's knee to keep him from marching on Saturday. maybe he'll have me march pregame for him, since taps stride is a lot more painful. I don't want to wish that pain on him, though, because he's a sweet guy and deserves to march every game. plus he's a 5th year and he doesn't have many more games left. thank god this room has finally warmed up. or maybe its because I put some pants on. do I smell smoke?? that wouldn't be good. Maybe Gina and I shouldn't leave the towels over the vent. even though it is blocking the freaking cold air from coming through. Oh my goodness this room is so cold in the morning!! holy cow you would think its January, not September! man, sleeping over at rustic's place last weekend was awesome. I was warm the entire night, and when I got hot I just kicked the covers off until I got cold. I guess the fact that I was wearing his pajama pants helped. no nothing happened. he's a really good guy. A Christian. his mom has a funny little story about premarital sex. it has to deal with a unicorn. Yeah I wont go into details. but it proves that he's a good guy. not to mention I spent both Friday and Saturday nights at his place. he didn't try a single thing! funny how dad thinks I trust guys too much, and make myself too 'available'. if only he knew me better, he would know that I'm VERY skeptical with guys. especially after so many of them lying to me. I'm sick of being cheated on and lied to, so I basically play hard to get. I don't think id consider it that, but I don't go easy on them. I'm not the stupid blonde you think I am. I really wish I was one or two steps up on the ladder. my whole life I felt like I wasn't quite good enough. I never won any student council positions, never quite made it to area band, made first chair wind last year on account of a new director but lost it the next semester, made alternate up here at UT, and wasn't elected as Newman representative. I don't understand it. I work my ass off to do the best I can, but that never seems to be good enough. why? my dad was valedictorian at his high school, and if I had good grades in elementary school where did the smarts go? why did I all of a sudden screw up math class in 7th grade? granted mrs glover refused to help me, and probably told me the wrong way to solve problems, but still. I did awesome in 8th grade prealgebra, and then algebra and geometry in high school. but once I hit algebra 2 and precal, shit hit the fan. I just hope I don't have to take calculus in college. but since I don't know what I want to do, I may have to. I really need to get that career test done. I've got to figure out what I want to do with myself by next semester. unless I stay in liberal arts, this whole semester has practically been a waste. not quite, because bio psy and band count (for nursing at least), but other than that. I don't know what I want to do. what do people do if they can't decide? take a lot of random classes I guess, but that's not me. I'm coming in with so many hours that I was hoping to graduate in 3 years. that way if I go to law school I can get in and out before I'm 30, ugly, and still single. I hope I meet someone up here. I'm not built to be single or to date for years to come. ahh nose needs to stop itching. why the heck do I have to be sick? I hate this! once hell week was done I got sick. yeah, that makes the first week of school start off real good. let me tell you. oh well. at least I did all the partying last weekend, before all the symptoms hit. and before my parents decided to come in. dangit! rustin has a kappa kappa psi thing at 8am Sunday morning, which means he probably wont party after the game Saturday night, which means I wont get to spend the night at his apartment because he wont be able to get up and take me back to my dorm at that obnoxious hour. oh but maybe after we paint his living room on Monday I could stay over. I don't have a class until 12:30 so that might work! jeez I'm a dork. I need to stop reading into things like this. the time will come when it decides to come. until then I got to sit back and watch things happen. oh look, I have 10 seconds left. dang ",1
932,"My first reaction to this assignment was to just write that I felt nothing and perhaps continue writing that for 20 minutes; however, I am interested in where this is going. Right now my boyfriend is poking me as he displays how I can touch-type and he cannot. The other day, we went to go and buy fish. We drove around Austin I don't know how many times just looking for pet stores. We drove to Highlands Mall, Lakeline Mall, Petsmart, and Petco. I finally, after searching and carefully chosing, found fish that were supposed. It really upset me that out of the 4 fish that I bought, none of them adapted well in the fish tank environment I previously had. The sole fish that I possessed in that tank ate all of the food I would drop into the tank continuously. It really began to bother me when I saw him nipping at the other fish's tails. So, I took matters into my own hands and separated him from my new, smaller fish. I understand that these unpleasant changes were my own fault. I knew that I was supposed to introduce the new fish into that environment slower and in a certain, specific procedure. Well, I finally figured out that things wouldn't work out between my old fish and the new fish, so I eliminated the problem by flushing the big fish. I am really suprised that I did this because I am such a humanitarian. For example, whenever my other fish would die, I would get other people to remove them from the tank because I couldn't deal with the dead fish. I always felt as though they were looking at me. There is one instance where I did flush other live fish, but once again, it was for the good of the aquarium. I don't know, I think I have always had such a problem with death. It scares me, but it doesn't. For example, I used to work at a hospital in San Antonio, when I was a junior in high school. This is where I had my first real encounter with death. I never had to experience death in my family, in friends, or aquaintences. However, since then I have had to deal with it several times. I guess I take that back, I have had to deal with death one time before, but it was in eighth grade. I can't remember all the minute details of it, but it really brought me and one of my friends together. Anyhow, this hospital death experience really opened my eyes to the whole death scenario. And I know this sounds corney, but every single time I have had to deal with death since then, I have seen a little yellow butterfly. This spiritual experience has consistently happened to me on about 5 or 6 occasions. Well, my 20 minutes is up. ",1
1726,"     i'm thinking about how if i do this all the way through, i'll be late   in meeting my girlfriend because i still have to shower and change.  my clothes are in the dryer, getting wrinkle free because i'm too lazy   to iron them. i'm thinking about last night and how leah and ia have   been having some weird moments lately, but i think that i can   attribute them mostly to stress. yesterday in dr. boetcher's office, she   mentioned dana and him being the one that leah was dating. cat's   out of the bag. i know, of course, and i've known for a while, but still   to hear someone else say it. i wonder why she never told me right   out that dana was her ex? its not like i'm stupid and i wouldn't put it   together. alicia is IMing me. . i haven't talke to her in a while. i   wonder how her friend fran is. she was cute. alicia says that she's   well and that NT hasn't changed. i don't miss it. or denton, really,   which makes me wonder why i'm going back there this weekend to   visit. i guess i just miss the people, but somehow i suspect that it   will be weird to see them. to be so removed from them for months,   it will all feel alien to me. i can't imagine myself there anymore. and   teaching today. . ugh. i'm not really looking forward to it. i'm afraid that   i won't remember my shit, that i won't be able to help these kids,   which is what i'm getting paid to do. its kind of silly to worry though,   after being surrounded by math and science for the past two years, i   hope that i'll remember something. and i'm hungry. it weird seeing   tamsters around school. its almost like they shouldn't be here. like   when you see random people in a dream that creep you out   because they don't seem like they should be allowed to invade your   mind. i'm not used to all this reading in school. i wish i had a   snickers. i'm used to math homework and bs like that, not actually   having to read and digest stuff like that. i like it, just not used to it. i   need to shower. i'm worried that i won't be able to finish this.

1675,"Right now I'm sitting in my dorm room. The TV is on and the band called   The Calling   is playing. I really like they're music, they kind of soothe my thoughts and put me at ease. Music plays an integral role in how my attitude is for a certain day or time. Many times I'll listen to something that is very hard and angry and it will put me in a bad mood, however, that rarely happens. I'm really kind of worried about my laundry at this time. I have honestly never washed any clothes, so it presents a particularly daunting task to myself. I have just realized how long 20 minutes is, and it seems a lot longer than what i figured it would be. Although this task isn't particularly challenging, it's interesting to try to think about what i'm thinking about. Many times I think the things I'm thinking of are reflected by hearing as well as sight. I've noticed this because I'm listening to music now and the song is a mellow number that is making me really relaxed. I need to make some Gatorade, because I drank all of it yesterday. Reese Witherspoon is really hot, there's a picture of her in front of me, and she is beautiful. Now there's two songs playing at the same time, and that is sort of bothering me. First of all because i like them both, second of all because it's hard to keep up with both of them. Earlier I mentioned that my laundry was bothering me, well that is really a trivial task. More precendent on my mind is making good grades in my classes. College is easy so far, however I haven't had any tests and just one quiz, in my Spanish class. I think i fared ok on that quiz, so I'm happy about that. However, I'm still very curious as to what I actually made. When i first got to Jester my allergies acted up really bad, due to the inordinate amount of dust in the room. After the first week I got acclimated to it, I guess, and now I'm doing just fine. I had an appointment at the SSB to get my allergy shots this afternoon, so I treked over there after I ate lunch. When i got there the lady informed me that she had double booked the nurse in charge of giving shots. She was paranoid that I would be mad at her, but of course I wasn't mad. It takes a lot to get me mad, and something like that is just a minor inconvenience to me. So I just went about my way. I am also happy that I got my computer problem resolved. Seether put on a great show at Ozzfest on Saturday. Their lead singer sounds a lot like Kurt Cobain, who was awesome. All of Seether's songs were really great, they impressed me. Chevelle put on a good show too, as did Lost Prophets. Wow, I find myself continually looking at the time above, to see how close I am to getting finished with this assignment. I'm really thirsty. Another thing that perplexes me is the experiments for this class. I suppose I'll try to sign up for something after I finish this typing assignment. I'm really kind of worried about getting all those experiments done and all that. I guess that worry stems from not knowing that much about the experiments. Lately my feet have started hurting a little bit, well, i guess it's not really a   hurt  , but more of a burn. Perhaps my soles are giving out. Wow, I'm almost finished, I have less than 15 seconds left. This was really kind of cool, the 20 minutes went by pretty fast, bye. ",1
736,"Twenty minutes seems like a very long time to have to write about what I am thinking in my conscience. I just got a letter from my aunt. She was writing to see if I was ok and whether or not I like UT. So far I do like UT. I just wish that I had the social skills to make friends easier. I am not a very out-going person and it takes me long periods of time to become good friends with people. I am very picky about the type of people I hang out with. I especially dislike snobby people. I realize people are all equal and that under no circumstances should anyone believe they are better then someone else. Although sometimes I do feel I am smarter than other students here at UT. Everyone always tells me I have a huge amount of potential, but that I need to motivate myself to use my potential. Sometimes I feel very lonely. I am an only child and my parents divorced when I was five. I have never really had a real relationship. I want so bad to have someone in my life that will stand to hang out with me twenty-four hours a day. This wish makes me seem very needy and I hate to think that I am a needy person. For some reason I think being needy makes me weak. Oh, well, on to something else, this so far hasn't been very fun. I am not sure what I want to do with my future. I am undeclared in the college of natural sciences. Undeclared could be used to describe my entire life. I try, subconsciensly to avoid any huge decisions. I sometimes think that I want to be a psychiatrist. However, this is for selfish reasons. I believe that I am self-sufficient. I don't want to let someone else fix my problems. If I became a psychiatrist then I would be able to analyze myself and determine why I am screwed up. At the top of this assignment it said not to worry about spelling. I guess it's the perfectionist in me, but there is no way I could leave behind a trail of mispelled words. I realize though that there are some mispelled words in this paragraph though. I wonder if someone is actually going to read this. I keep having to look over my shoulder. I am worried that my roomate is going to read this and think I am some kind of weirdo. Is weirdo actually a word?  For some reason I don't think it is. Weirdo makes me think of Gonzo from the Muppet Babies, also that blue guy from Seasame Street. I haven't watched those shows in years. It's funny what people think of sometimes. Actually time is slipping by pretty fast. Ummm. I can't think of anything to write. My schedule is so screwy. I have four classes on M, W, F, and then one on T,Th. It gives me plenty of time to work on homework or prepare for classes though. My mom is susposed to get on Instant Messenger tonight so we can chat. I miss her and my best friend a lot. My dad is an asshole. Can we curse on this assignment?  I was never able to before. College is so different, people actually treat us like adults. I want to get an apartment. I don't like living in the dorm. Not enough personal space. I also want a dog. My favorite breed of dog is the chow-chow. However everyone always tells me they are very protective of their owners and can become aggressive towards strangers. I want two so that they can keep each other company while I am at school. That is a dream though. I have to decide whether or not I want to get my car fixed or sell it. I am leaning towards getting it fixed because it is a good car, Nissan Stanza, and there is no way I can buy a new car. The only problem is that it is an '87. That is really old compared to all my friends cars. My best friend drives a '99 Tahoe. Lots of people call him spoiled, but I don't think so. Well time is up, I'm not sure I got the point of this exercise though! ",0
969,"Ok, it is 2:02 in the morning and I don't even know why I am doing this assignment --- I just spend over an hour doing the experiment pretesting and I should have gone to bed before I even started doing that, considering the faxct that it is not due for a while. but, I guess it is good that I did it now cause I tend to procrastinate and I probably would have ended up on the due day trying to get connected to the sight and have 40 million other people trying the same thing --- connecting to these sights are so ridiculous - it was impossible to get through the ut main sight to register for classes -- I'm spelling sight the wrong way, I think - spelling is one of my worst subjects, derek always makes fun of me for the way I spell and how I am the only graduate of high school who can't spell the simplest words (for example, that one!)  he also laughs cause I always say periferial vision the wrong way --- he's so smart, he makes me sick, I don't know what I would do if I were that smart - I guess that I could do anything that I wanted to, and I guess he sort of does too, he went to school last year and partied all the time and still got higher than a 3. 5 - that's what I got in high school, and I admit that I didn't study, but I also didn't go out every night - I guess I just procrastinated and pretended like I had more to do than I really did, but then all of the work piled up and I really did end up to have lots to do, but I also let the work pile up because I was talking to derek on the phone ---- my parents almost killed me because of the phone bill, and made me pay for it - and it was so expensive! my phone bill is already going to be skyrocketting and I have only been here for a week and a half, but most of it is to my parents, so that will be acceptable to them cause they were the ones who wanted to find out what rush was and how it went and they wanted every single detail, so I guess I can't really get in trouble!  ok, it is 2:09 and I don't have anything to write about already - I guess I have a short attention span casue this was fun at first and now I would rather go and call derek and talk to him on the phone, or check my email or something - I am so proud that I am actually trying to do my work ahead of time, then again this is the fun homework and I always get the fun stuff done first and then have all of the bad and boring stuff left till the end - if I type fast, which I think I do, I am going to have ended up typing a lot more stuff in 20 minutes than other people would have, and that's not really fair, but that's ok, cause I talk a lot and am sure that I will find stuff to talk about even if it is not in any kind of readable and understandable form ---- I don't like puncuation - I just like dashes like a thought afterwards or something, though that is normally what it is, I also don't like to capitalize a lot if I am writing something really fast and not stopping, so that is why this is not capitalized and has lots of hyphens, they are just more fun --- I wonder who was the first person who evewr thought to make little faces out of the symbols on the keyboard, I mnean, who sits down at his/her computer and looks at all of the punctuation keys, ect. and thinks, oh that would make a smiley face, ect?  the icq smiley faces are better than the ones on aol cause they automatically turn into the stereotypical yellow smiley face instead of the actual punctuation marks - derek bought boxers with me that were joe boxer once, and that was kind of embarrasing cause there was an old lady right there and I didn't want her to think that we were doing inappropriate things and that I was just used to seeing his boxers all of the time, so I pretended I was his sister, though that's what I feel like anyway - we have known eachother for so long, told eachother so many things, and done so much with each other that we are just like brother and sister - I don't know what I am going to do next year, I guess I can just I'm him, but that's never as good as talking on the phone and the international calls would get me killed, but I can't stand the thought of not hearing his voice and all of the different inflections therein!  how sad! I guess I won't think of that for now, but that's just going to make it worse next year, but then again, maybe we will have gotten in some huge fight and not be talking by then, which would of course e bad, but on the other hand, it could be good cause then I would not be wishing that I was talking to him - ok, I forgot what time I started writing this and it is 2:18 I think it was 2:05 - oh no I think it was 2:02 --- I am going to cheat and stop to look at what time it is for the sake of my poor hands that are getting ready to fall off - I need to get back into the habit of typing, though it was so hard for me not to be typing in classes today and yesterday - I have no hope of keeping up while I am taking notes by hand, I am just not used to it - there was one guy in my chem class taking notes on his laptop, so maybe I'll bring mine next time so that I will actually leave with good notes, but chem is the worst class to bring the laptop to cause there are lots of charts and drrawings ect. that take me too long to do on the laptop that I would have to do on paper, leave space on the word processor, print it out and then copy the picture back to the other sheet, but I don't htink I would do that, or I guess that I would wnat to - iam getting sleepy and want to go to sleep - my roommate goes to bed too early and has classes too early and I feel badly keeping her up, but she said that she was a night person and I todl her that I definitely was, and I guess she'll have to get used to it, but I still feel badly --- it is now 2:22 and I forgot to look and see waht time I started so I guess I willl look now and if it was at 2:02 I will not write any more and if it was at :05 then I will have 3 minutes left to write - is that right? I am so bad at mental math - derek is so good at it, he makes me sick - I can't do anything in my head and he can do more in his head than I can with the calculator, but that's ok I can do things that he can't so I guess we have to even out sometime - I guess that I will check the time now.

1269,"As I begin writing this I am a little annoyed because I'm doing it on my friends computer mine is broken. I wish I could just get my computer to work and be dependable. Also as I'm typing I'm thinking ahead as of what to say I guess I shouldn't do that or maybe that's just the way I think. The phone just started ringing but I'm not even going to answer it. I've been laying around all night watching a movie with a girl I used to like a lot. She's a beautiful girl and part of me still likes her but oh well. Things are different now and I don't really mind that. Also I've recently decided that I didn't want to be in a fraternity. I always thought I would, but really it just wasn't my thing. Right now I'm kind of kicking myself because I'm missing out on partying, but at the same time I hated the amount of time I spent doing stuff at the house. I felt like every one was here to party and study on the side. I wish I could do that but I can't, I need to do well in school. This weekend is Dave Matthews and I'm very excited. The concert is two nights and I'm going to both. Dave is my favorite musician and I've been looking forward to it for a long time. Also it is very hot in this room where I'm typing I wish that I could just some how make it like fifty degrees in here. I really like the cold weather and am looking forward to a break from the heat in the upcoming months. I think I like the cold because I'm hot natured, but also because I have good memories of winters. I love to reflect on the Christmas with my grandparents. As I glance down at my watch I see that my time is almost up so I guess I'll try to muster something great up. I don't know I'm a blank. I do however miss my family a little. I really miss my brother. It's odd because we always used to annoy each other but now I'd really get a kick out of seeing him. ",1
1121,"Entering college is a whole new experience that is new to me. One that is unique in its own right. An experience that begins a new transition from the home to a life of individuality and freedom. Being only three hours away from home, it didn't seem like I was breaking away on my own, but in actuality this is only the start of creating a new life for myself. After high school, everyone left there own way in seeking out a future for themselves. One friend would move to New York and another would move to California. The once click of friends that you grew up is now a long distance relationship creating friends coast to coast. Although UT is a new change for me, it is one that is welcoming because it begins a new chapter in your life and basically gives you a clean slate to work on. From this day forward, I am able to become whatever my heart desires and whatever happened in the past I can put behind as memories. The challenge is a great one however with its competitive nature. Back in high school, I would hear stories of friends failing out of UT due to its luring temptation of the atmosphere of clubs and alcohol. Everyone seemed to be lured into the trap and go deranged when they got on their own. I would hear stories of friends messing up in school and having to return home. These stories although depressing helped me however in establishing the goal that I would not be like the rest, but an individual. That's what UT is basically is, just a group of individuals all with the same goal, a goal of succeeding which is sad that some take it lightly and begin to ruin their lives. Its like its own community at UT. All students relatively the same age trying to create a future for themselves. I sometimes wonder if I have what it takes to succeed at UT. My mind is still in doubt seeing the enormous campus each day as I walk to class. But all I can ask for is for my best and that is good enough for me. Even though UT is a different city than my home town Dallas, I still feel like I haven't left Dallas in a way. With all my friends attending this University it just seems like Dallas all over again which is one of the reasons I was considering going out of State. It seems great to have a large number of your friends close to you, but in a way I have a desire to start totally fresh. Throughout campus, I would see students from my school walking up and down the street and sometimes wish that a whole new atmosphere was around me so that I can begin a life that is not attached to my old one. The University of Texas does however let you become any kind of person you desire with a new start even though it is kind of mixed in with the old. As for home, I sometimes wonder if my parents are doing well without me. With their constant calls and visits, it seems like they lost a part of themselves when they had to let go of me. So along with the stress that comes along with being a student at a UT, my stress also comes with the worry of how things are back home. Seeing my mom cry, tore my heart apart with the goodbye that completed my transition to UT. I notice how people don't show how lucky they are that they have an opportunity like going to UT but instead take it lightly as if its nothing when in fact thousands of dollars are being invested in you in hopes that you create a successful future for yourself. College is a whole new experience that allows you tremendous independence. It is my job that I spend my time wisely and take advantage of the situation in creating something out of myself. I see some of my friends just wasting their lives away on drugs and partying. I would like to do something for them, but their destiny is their own fate of what they and make out of it. All I can offer them is my support. Although fear did strike me before I entered UT, it now has turned into an excitement of a whole new world. ",0

SO anyway. its been real. I'm actually sad to go. I've become so attached. talk to you later!!! love y a more!!! ~~~~~~joshua ",0
1366,"right now I'm thinking about how I don't want to do this I just want to get to new mexico and start hunting. this is the fifteenth year me and my dad have been doing this. it all started when I was 3 I can remember my first time of course I didn't shoot anything that year just kind of watched but it was still fun. I'm also excited that my best bud justin gets to go with us I met him at church camp my freshman year of high school. he's not from kerrville he's from boerne but after that first year we were always kicking it together every weekend. we have had some fun times parties, going wakeboarding at the lake, snow skiing, spring break at south padre. its all good. well back to hunting now, its a good drive and here I am stuck doing my homework instead of driving in the car, I wish I had a lap top then I could do this while I was driving. I almost got one, but my dad changed his mind and got me the box. I'm not complaining because I have a burner and did and its real fast and all but a lap top just seems more versatile. dang how long is twenty minutes. when your sleeping twenty minutes goes by SO FAST but when your doing homework or sitting in some boring class, IT TAKES FOREVER. funny how that works. any way I wish the twenty minutes was over and it almost is just a few more minutes left. at least this was an easy assignment, not some hardcore 235346 page essay you wanted typed out single spaced font size of 9. I have to do one of those for English and I haven't even thought about. I'm a procrastinator it will probably be the night before and I hadn't even started on it, oh man I just got a big time hunger for ice cream, chocolate ice cream that is. after this maybe ill go get some, I hope you don't take off for grammar or are expecting proper English in this thought page. because I'm just writing what comes to me and my thoughts move faster than I write so its kind of hard because I have so many thoughts yet my hands can only go so fast. dang there are a lot of hot chicks at UT I'm glad that me and the girl I was dating from home decided to date other people before we went away to school, because I would be a bad boy and want to mess around on her, but I'm not like that, I have real guilty conscience. any way back to those hot chick, dang so many girls and only 4 years of college to get to know them all. I hope I can fit them all in to my busy schedule, you right like they would give me the time of day well actually a real hot chick asked me the time but that's about all she would give me dang like I said twenty minutes is a long time and the clock is going very slowly I swear it hasn't moved since I started. now I'm thinking about ""what's going through my mind what can I type to take up space maybe I should just start typing long words but then I wouldn't spell them right so its no use. any way back to school and back to this 20 minute writing assignment. I don't know what to right, I'm drawing a blank, dang its like my mind is running black. well now I'm worried about not having enough crap packed. I can't wait to go to new mexico, its my favorite trip of the year, its all I can think about right now because I'm leaving right after I finish this. only a few more minutes. I'm going home and I can't wait to see my dog. of all the people at my house to miss, I can't wait to see my dog, he probably doesn't care but oh well, I can't wait to see him. ",0
514,"I think that I am a pretty friendly guy who is fun to hang with but no one ever calls me. I don't know if its because I get decent grades and look studious that they figure that I won't want to do anything or if its just because they don't like me and they are just pretending to like me. I used to think that I had good judgement of people but after finding out that all my friends in high school basically used me in class and ignored me outside of class, I have questioned in from then on. My quest to find a good group of reliable friends always seems to come to a dead end. I look at both of my sisters who are always getting calls from their classmates and friends and I never get any. They don't help much either because they are always reminding about the fact that I have no friends. I know people and I say hi to them in the hallways and class and they talk to me normally in class but outside of class I have no touch with them. I admit that I have done the best of job of keeping in touch with anyone, but I've started to this year but with no results so far. I always end up doing the calling and asking what people are up to. No one ever calls me. It just makes me mad. While people are complaining about all the junk mail and excess mail they get, I basically hoping or looking forward to getting one message per day. Lately, I think I'm so obsessed with it that I religiously check my e-mail hoping that something new happened. Other than that everything so far is going well. I've already joined a couple of clubs, got some leadership positions and will be volunteering. My resume is starting to shape up. Now if only my grades would follow, a decent grade on the MCAT would give me an excellent chance of getting into a decent medical school. Before none of these things bothered me before, even in high school. Just like in high school I see other people doing things and never cared that I never did. But once I came to college, it just started bothering me. I don't know if its my sister's influence or what its become a problem that last year kept me from doing good in my classes. Whether its same or not this year, I'm not going to let it ruin my grades. I hope to get a 4. 0 from now till I graduate. I tried talking to people, opening up about my problems and things like that because some people told me that I was to closed and that they didn't feel at ease with me because it looked like I was too serious. Everyone that knows me never seems to think that I'm serious. They don't think that I give a care about anybody or anything but myself. I don't mean to come of that way but I'm just good at expressing my emotions. When I do, the response that I've gotten from others is that I'm stupid if I can't even figure it out by myself. I figured maybe I caught them at a wrong time or something and would try again but same thing happens. After a while I feel like I'm starting to bug them and just let it go. I think that I am a good listener but no one ever tells me about their problems. I think they think that they can't trust me or won't be able to help them. I wish they would because I truly do get a rush out of helping people for some reason. I'm not saying it because I'm egotistical or overwhelmed by myself but I really do enjoy helping others. If I didn't become a doctor, I really wouldn't mind becoming a teacher. I don't know if its because I get to showcase what I know and understand or if its because I just enjoy making someone else understand but I just like it. I would hate it if it was an ego thing, because I always tried to fight against the ego thing. Sometimes I can be at certain moments but later after I think about it I usually apologize for my mistakes. Most people get on me about being egotistical but if they ever looked at themselves objectively they would find that they have a greater ego. If I point that out to them they'll just ignore and say that I am wrong and give me longer lecture on me being egotistical or something else. I try to use their own words, conversation, statements examples whatever but they just deny it. I'm not strong willed enough to continue the argument so I usually give up. I lose a lot of arguments. I think that humans generally think that if they win an argument then they must be right and not necessarily because they just talked more than the other person. I find or observe a lot of ironic things about humans and wonder how the things can co-exist. I find them very interesting. Just the possibilities even the slightest that something every is against is actually the right way. When I try to discuss this someone else, they just look at me as if I'm just crazy. I have a lot of curiosity and like to explore but at my own pace and not at societies beckoning. Maybe that's why I have a hard time fitting into society. I haven't found a group of people yet that are categorized as me or have the same ironic interests, at least ironic according to societies view. I'm a mix of several things both culturally and socially. Well that's about 30 minutes now think I'm going to go on to assignment two. ",0
409,"I mean, there were many questions about over eating. of course everyone wants to lose weight that is a given. and the thing about the spiders is just plan dumb. oh but my friend on the fourth floor asked me to go up and kill a lizard for her. when I went in to the room she was on top of a chair with a flashlight shinning at the lizard. it was hilarious. and it wasn't like the lizard was huge. she was just really really afraid. man, I  have a lot of homework and studying to do. I came here in the summer and I always had reading to do and now it is like I have 3 times the work. it is very cold right now. my room always stays below 60. oh man, I woke up at 11:00am to the sound of someone drilling!! I was very upset. it lasted about an hour and a half. I have a lot of laundry to do. my clothes are all strung out on my floor. I wonder if anyone is going to read this besides the psychology department. I don't think any normal people would want to read this. you know it wasn't until this previous year that I learned how to spell psychology correctly. weird huh? I just never took the time to learn. my sister went and watched saving private ryan. she said that it wasn't any good and that she hated and the killing. and now she will have a test over it on monday. she said it was hard for her to pay attention. for her sake I hope she paid good enough attention that she passes it. I had the same english teacher that she has right now. I won't mention any names but she is a really hard teacher. she started out as a dean of students at sul and then she went to my old high school. she was really hard and expected a lot out of us. I found that I like the challenge. I think that someone just had a wreck. I'm sitting here typing and I heard screeches and then a bang. I heard that this morning, only it was a bigger bang. I didn't get up to look. I was very tired. I hope that everyone is okay. my room is very cold!!! I wonder why they set the thermostat so low. here it is in the summer and I'm sitting in my room with sweet pants and a long sleeve shirt on. I normally have on a sweater. you know, I wonder what everyone else will be typing about. I decided not to worry about capitalizing my words because the instructions stated to not worry about grammar or sentence structure, which is great because I'm not that good with grammar and sentence structure. I wish we didn't have to type for 20 minutes. I have been going for 13 minutes now. I hope that the next seven minutes go by fast. to whoever is reading this, how many have you read? I wonder if there are any interesting. I think that psychology could be interesting. I just don't like some professors. for example, in my exercise physiology class I have this proff that just kills the class. not literally, but it is a very interesting class and I have trouble staying awake. I wonder if I chose the right major. I mean I like physical therapy and all, but I think that I would rather be working with cancer patients. I wonder what people are writing on this thing. I wonder if someone is treating it like their own personal diary. I have four minutes now. after these four minutes are up I'm going swimming. no not really, I have to do homework. I have a big concert to go to tomorrow and I'm trying to finish all my studies. you know I use to never use the word studies but for some reason it just came to my head. I like to write papers like these, no grammar, no structure just typing. I like to type I can type over 70 wpm. I'm currently looking for a job. and so if the person reading this knows of any available positions that I might be good for, you just let me know. I have one more minute left and I plan on finishing at the time I am suppose to. I bet that some people don't type for twenty minutes. I could have typed for 10 minutes for all you know. for some reason at the beginning of this assignment I was thinking about things to type but not any more. obviously. well my time is up. peace out.

2256,"So I have no idea what I am supposed to be doing with this. just typing I guess. Damn aim. No one ever wants to instant message me until I start doing something. There are so many times when I am just sitting here playing on the computer and doing nothing really, and no one wants to talk. The minute I start doing something productive, there is like five people trying to talk to me at once. All that typing and its only been two minutes. I have no idea what to type. Can your mind really go blank?  I mean, I want to use the expression right now, my mind is blank, because I'm not really thinking about anything, but obviously I'm thinking about something because I am typing this stuff. So my mind really isn't blank then. So I guess your mind doesn't really ever go blank. My roommate is funny. I keep picturing her when I walked in the door from class earlier. She was asleep on the couch but she had the pillow on her face. How someone can sleep with a pillow on their face is beyond me. Its looked so funny though. I should have took a picture. I'm really sleepy already and its only going to be seven o'clock in the evening. I am still not used to this getting up early for class stuff. Ah. The new real world is on tonight. I absolutely love watching that show. All the drama. Its interesting to watch. Its kind of sad though I think, the way people love to watch reality shows. I mean, they are not really a true picture of reality. They film for hours and hours and hours, but the show itself is usually only a half hour episode, and they usually only run for a few months, once a week. Can u imagine how much film ends up on the ""cutting room floor"" as they call it. All the drama and stuff is pretty much made up by producers if you think about it. If not made up completely at least embellished. And its all because of editing. Birthday. Someone on TV just said the word birthday. I'm so excited. My birthday is a week from tomorrow. Yeah!  but I also have my dad's birthday next week and my boyfriend's too. And I have no idea what to get them. Actually what to get my boyfriend. My dad is easy. A gift certificate for tools or golf stuff and he is happy. My boyfriend. I don't know. He already has plenty of cologne (did I spell that right?) so I don't want to get him that. And I always buy him clothes. I want to get him something different this time but I have no idea what. And he is going to be 21. Lucky. Everyone is leaving me behind. I am the youngest of a lot  of my friends. So now they can all go out to the bars. Without me. So sad. I still have a whole year to go. Bleh I hate waiting. Bleh. Is that a word? I type it a lot on aim. Its my way to say yucky or boring or I don't know. I heard it from somewhere though. I can't remember where. Ha-ha. My roommate is up. I wonder if she knows she was sleeping with a pillow on her face. Because it fell off when I came in. Bleh. I am not looking forward to waking up early tomorrow again. I think we should have a fall break. kind of like spring break. I need my rest. Its only the third week of school and I'm already so exhausted. I need a break.     ",1
313,"Well, I figured I should write this right now while I have time. I am really busy lately. It kind of seems like I have no time for myself anymore. I am trying out for crew. There are a lot of people trying out though. I think like 130 people are going for 32 spots. I hope I make it though because I don't deal well with failure. I tried out for the soccer team and did not make it, but that was a little unfair because I did not know the work out to prepare for and everyone else did. So now everyone probably thinks I just wasn't good enough when that really was not the reason. I was just too exhausted after running to play with any skill. Oh well. I guess it taught me how to cope with failure. But it really hurts every time I fail. I tried to get into the business school and was denied. That got me so mad. There are all of these total morons in the business school. I know because I take classes with them and always make better grades than them. But alas, they can do what they want with their lives they entered right out of high school. Oh well. I am still going pre-law so it doesn't matter. Unfortunately my roommate and a lot of my friends are in it, so it is a constant reminder that I did not get in. But I think that all of this just makes me a stronger person. I am trying to be really involved this year. I am lifeguarding for the rec center. It is kind of fun, but I kind of dread going to work all the time. I just seem to have a lot of things on my plate. I had a fight with my boyfriend the other day. I am not sure if it was his fault or if I caused it because of all the stress I am under. Oh well. I think that things have really changed between me and my roommate too. Last year we used to be like best friends, but now things are different. She seems to be really distant. I am not sure what is wrong with her. Maybe it is my fault. I am not around as much as I used to be, so maybe she just wants more attention and is finding it elsewhere. She also has a boyfriend, so she spends a lot of time with him, which is fine with me. I just feel like things have totally changed. She went to a party last night and didn't invite me. Weird. I think I am really different from most people. I always seem to put everyone else's feelings before mine. I just don't understand why people don't do that. Or maybe I don't understand why I do that. Like, I would invite everyone to come with me if I was doing something cool. But all the people around me just I think are selfish. Maybe I just need to find a whole new group of friends. I mean, I had my first day of tryouts for crew, which was a pretty big deal to me. And when I see my boyfriend, he doesn't even ask how I did. He totally forgot about it. That gets me so mad. He seems to forget about everything. He then says how he is a bad boyfriend. Unfortunately, I have to agree with him. But don't get the wrong impression of me. I am actually a very happy person. I am just going through a lull right now. Once I get into a normal routine in my life I think I will be a lot happier. I just wish that my family was here. My parents live in Virginia, and it is hard with them so far away. At least my brother is here with me. That makes it a lot easier. I don't know what I would do if he wasn't here. I never realized how dependent I was on other people. I always thought of myself as a kind of loner, but I guess I really am not. I like being around people, and maybe I do get jealous when they do not choose to be with me. I think I really need to work on the jealousy thing. That is probably why I am having problems with my boyfriend. He finally made some friends here, so he hangs out with them. I think I also don't really trust him. I don't want him sharing intimate things about us to them. He was asking me the other day why I back away from intimacy and am afraid to talk about it. I just don't like talking about it. I consider it a private thing, and should just be shared between two people. It is nobody else's business. But I guess since we are in college, that is the way things are. Sex is on everyone's mind. But it just doesn't really seem to be on my mind very much. I would much rather just cuddle that have sex. Maybe I am weird, I don't know. But that drives my boyfriend crazy. He want's to have sex all the time. I think that is a major problem in our relationship. Oh well. Well, I guess my time is about up. I now have to go to crew again. I should do good today because it is strength training. I am pretty confident about that. Well, I guess I only have one more of these to write. That relieves some of my stress. Actually this was pretty cool doing this. I could just write down what I have been keeping inside. Pretty neat. ",1
1812,"     Hello. I'm not quite sure what to think about this. I love to write, but I write in such a way that I can always go back and correct it. it's almost like I find myself having to check everything I do a million times because I never like it the first time. So to sit here and write for 20 minutes, knowing that it has to be continuously. . that's almost too much. And another thing. I don't really like not having a topic. I find it's not kind organized, and I'm not sure where to take the topic. Maybe I'm afraid of what I'll say the first time around, which could be interpretted to me that I'm afraid of my true feelings, but I think when I type that, everyone will think I'm only saying that because this is psychology. That's not true. I supress everything. Everything. I don't think anyone knows the real me, because I've never really let anyone in. I would love to, however. if I ever felt like they truly wanted to be let in, but as it stands, none of it matters. Man, I am sounding like a real nut. This is not cool. I am crazy, I think. And now, my mind is thinking about the cowboys game I was watching before this. It was in the 4th and it was going nothing but downhill for 'em. I like the Cowboys a lot, and I hope they win, but school is important, and besides, I couldn't watch them lose like that anymore. Boo to football. Boo to losing. It all sucks. And now, with that wonderful segway, I guess I could talk about other things. things not so trivial. Man, 20 minutes is a long time. I wonder if any of this will make sense, if it can even be read on a scale or whatever it will do when I click finish. Man, I wish I could click finish right now. No such luck. No such luck. No such thing. Isn't that the name of the song that John Mayer sings?  He sucks because he's going out with Jennifer Love Hewitt. I like Jennifer Love Hewitt a lot and I like typing her name because it's so long that it passes the time. Jennifer Love Hewitt. Jennifer Love Hewitt. . and that makes me out to be a freak too. . how many times can I type her name. isn't that a waste of time. isn't cheating?  Why am I talking this way?  You know, I want to get a poster of Jennifer Love Hewitt for my bathroom. I've never really put up posters. But now that I have my own apartment bedroom, I think I should. It's a good expression of me, but I wonder what everyone who enters my bathroom will think. Will they think I'm this big horny toad who likes having her in my bathroom? Well, not having her, but you know. Speaking of which, I need a girlfriend!  My shower curtain is so clear, and the mirror is right across the bathroom. It's kind of weird washing my hair to look over and see myself. washing my hair. Imagine the possibilities. Now, if I had that poster of Jennifer Love Hewitt, I could look out and stare at her. Only, it wouldn't really be her. I don't know what I'm talking about. I bet if I start talking about girls I actually know, when I click finish, I'll find out a lot of stuff. Which brings me to this girl I like. I don't understand how I can have so much with her. No, wait. I take that back. What I really don't understand is how a girl can have so much fun with me, and be so comfortable around me, and still not want to go out. I feel like the girl of the friendship. I want the serious relationship, and she doesn't want to be tied down. What is tied down?  Why look at something so negatively. I mean, if you're happy with someone, why should you obsess over what might tempt you in the future. Planning out your future is one thing, but planning to stray or be attracted to someone else is quite another. I've been told I'm too young to love right now anyway, and I should wait, but I don't think anything changes. I mean, I know myself too well. and I know that I would be so happy to be in a relationship that everything else would subside; it wouldn't matter. Happiness isn't easy to come by, and I would hold on to it like nothing I've ever held on to before. So, yeah, I just. I'm just so confused about everything. I've never been in a serious relationship, and I've been told that's why I want one so much. I don't know. It's kind of like. of course it's what I want. We want what we can't have. That makes me feel even worse, but old sayings like that are around for a reason. I just. wish I had something to offer that could win her over. Something, besides everything else I offer to her, to make her see that it's all worth it. That she shouldn't worry about the future, because I will take care of everything. Of course, thinking about it like that, I have to totally become unbiased: if she is not wanting to go out with me, because she doesn't want to be tied down, then she is planning on going out with several guys in the meantime. I guess you could say that means I'm saving myself a lot of heartache, but it also means that even though she's planning this multitude of guys over the next few years, she still won't choose me. I'm still just a friend. I know guys hate that. I used to tell my friends that were in the same situation that   being friends was great. You still have the girl as a friend. So what if you can't go out?  You can still hang out, and you can still talk.   Well, then I actually found myself in their shoes, and I understand. It's so much clearer. From the outside, it looks good. When you get there, not only does it feel gut-wrenching, it also feels like everyone on the outside is laughing at you, like they can't understand any of it. And I don't understand that, but it's like, you're screwed even though you know better. I knew better. I know I lose a friendship that is extremely important. and maybe it's a risk that I shouldn't take. I say that because I can't take it; otherwise, I would have already, and I would probably be somewhere crying right now. Not that I cry. Not that that's bad. I just. always find a way to hide my emotion, which may be part of my problem. I'm not crazy. I just. I'm a big fan of fate. I think what's meant to be is exactly that, so if this girl and I are meant to be then we will be. And if not, I'll just sit around and wonder why. 5 seconds. By the way, John Mayer is a cool singer. Just sucks he's going out with Jennifer Love Hewitt!  The End. I went over. Wow that was fast. Bye. ",0
786,"I feel kind of nervous right now. I have never done anything like this before. at least not as something to turn in for a class. lately, I've been thinking about school and how this semester is going to. I need to start looking for a job sometime this week. one of my best friends is coming back from Sacremento, CA this weekend, so I'm really excited about that. I haven't bought all of my books yet, so I'm hoping to do that soon, especially for this class because we have a test pretty soon. I took this class last semester but I totally slacked off and got a D in it, but I need to take it again in order to get into child psychology. I don't want to let my parents down again. my sister took this semester off because she got bad grades last semester. I know that I can do really well this semester if I really want to and I think that I do. I just really hope that everything works out ok. I guess you've probably noticed by now that I ramble on and on. I think that stream of consciousness is really cool. I think it was Virginia Woolf who made it popular. I think it was her. I  loved the way she would start talking about one thing and then that thing would remind her of something else and then she'd go off on that. I don't know how much I'm supposed to be writing . I think this assignment is neat. I hope that I'm going to be able to handle working and goingt to school. I worked at late night at jester last semester, and I think it was the hours that threw me off because I would work from 8pm to 1am. I live at kinsolving this year and I think that it's a lot better than Jester. I think I've been writing quite a bit already and I think that this is my stream of consciousness. all that I really do think about is doing well this semester because I want to be an elementary teacher already. so I guess I just hope.

1958,"Well I just got don't talking to my brother. He is doing well. That is good becasue I worry about him, and I don't even worry about him that much until I hear him say that he eats lunch and dinner alone. He is only a freshmen at UTA and it's only been like a week and he has to have time to make friends but he is just not as good as I am at making friends. My mom worries about him too, so that makes me worry even more. It is cold in here. I wish it was warmer, but I have one roommate who likes it hot and one who likes it cold and the one who likes it cold is in the living room and I can't exactly argue since she pays rent here too. oh well. She is watching CSI, which is not something I terribly care for, its an ok show but I have different things that I watch. Her and I tried to go to the gym earlier to play racquetball bt all the courts were full, so we reserved one for tomorrow, but who knows what is going on tomorrow. We rode our bikes there and it is so hot outside, I cannot wait until it gets cold, although I will complain then too but at least the cold is more easy to deal with then the heat at least to me. god the TV is loud, I don't know why its so loud, its just me and her in the room. I have a lot to do and I am putting it off. I have math homework due next wednesday and I need to get it don't before this weekend because my boyfriend is going back home to houston and he is my help for that class. I understand just about nothing in that class and it scares me. He is very patient with me and I love him and are very grateful to him that he takes time out of his homework to help me with mine. right now his roommates are mad at him because all he does now is hang out with me and they don't understand why, well they understand but hey don't like it and I cannot help it, its his choice. I am worried about chemistry, I understand nothing in that class either. I thought I was good at chemistry, I wanted to be a pharmacist but now I just don't know and that scares me too. I am feeling extremely overwhelmed with everything right now. UT is a lot different from UTSA. my neck hurts and I don't know why, I didn't get to work out today, since the racquetball courts are full. my roommate just asked me if she could use my garlic. I don't really mind but she always throws a fit when I ask to borrow her stuff, not like its a big deal or anything it just gets on my nerves every now and then. I am so scared about chemistry, I have to ask my boyfriends roommate this weekend to help me figure it out. we have a quiz on tuesday over the stuff we have been learning although I feel like I have not been learning anything. it worries me so much, I feel like I have no direction again. I don't know what I want to be or what I want my major to be and my parents kept asking me and my advisor told me to just choose so I chose pharmacy and now with the chemistry part being so hard and I thought I was going to be good at it, I am scared that I won't be able to be a pharmacist anymore and that will only disappoint me and my parents. I feel like I have no direction and I can't just force myself to have one. I wish that I had something I was REALLY good at but I don't. I have a lot of things that I am good at but not one thing that I really excel in and sometimes that hurts my feelings and makes me feel bad about who I am. wow already been 13 minutes time goes by fast when you just keep typing. I need to shave my legs, now it smells gross in here because of the amount of garlic my roommate used. my arms are starting to hurt because of all the typing only 6 minutes to go. this writing thing is not that bad I think its a good idea I hope thy don't mind all my grammatical errors and or misspellings, why does my neck hurt!  I need to repaint my toenail, I keep messing them up because I won't let them dry all the way before I put my shoes back on. I wish my boyfriend would hurry up and come home at work no actually I am glad that he is working , he needs the money. our three year anniversary is coming up and I have nothing to get him, no idea whatsoever and neither of us have the money to do anything really special so I don't know exactly how this is going to work this year. man I wish I could get motivated to learn that chemistry stuff but I already feel so behind that it makes me discouraged to even try now. I know I will try but I just don't know I just wish that I knew what was going on in there. I was so good at it in high school and that was back in 10th grade and I remember some stuff that he has talked about but not hardly most of it and now I feel behind like I am not going to be able to catch up. I wish that it was not in such a big room I think that is part of my problem, I am not getting the basic review that I need to refresh my memory form so long ago but I guess that is partly my fault, I should be reading, and I am going to as soon as I can motivate myself and tell myself that I can do it and that I am good at it and that I do have a future being good at something.

810,"Right now at this moment, I am thinking about what I am doing here. This whole college thing is still new to me. My roommate is getting drunk right now with some guys, while I am in here writing this. At least she is meeting people. I wish I could go back in time, and be in high school again. I know that probably sounds stupid and immature,but I had a lot more fun in high school. I had friends all around me, I was popular, I was really close to the cutest guys in our school. Now, I do not know anyone. I am used to going out like everyday, so it is really weird to be actually doing my homework. You know what I really miss?  This guy back in Arlington named Luke. He was a complete ***hole, but I was and still am infatuated with him. I guess it is infatuation. I would like to think I love him, but I know that logically it is not possible for me to love him. He was my first you know. I am one of those Catholic girls, and I never thought I would lose it to some stupid high school boy. But, it happened. I wish that it would have happened, and I would not have had any feelings for him, but I do. He has a girlfriend who is younger than we are, and I am insanely jealous. Why could he establish a relationship with her, and not me. And why is it that he cheats on her with me?  These questions boggle my mind and make me upset. I know I deserve better. I am one of those Catholic, upperclass, spoiled girls. I have everything but what I want. Luke goes to Pepperdine University and is far away, but no one here has even caught my eye. I thought once I went to school, my life would just be incredibly better. Well, it really has not. College is not what I thought it would be. I know it is only like the middle of the third week, so I need to give it time. Freedom is great, though. I like not having to check in with the paternals. What is the great thing about that if I never use that priveledge. I am also thinking about how my psychology class is during a bad time. I mean class is at 3:30 and that is about the time I want to go to my dorm and sleep or just relax. I wish I could change my time, but it is too late now. Oh well. Also, I think that Burdine Hall is the hardest building to get to. I missed class today, because I could not find it. I hope we did not do anything important. I hate Chemistry!  Dr. White goes too fast and does not make sense. I don't know if I can survive that class. It is going to be tough. I am used to sleeping in all my classes, never doing homework, and just getting by. That was high school, this is college. How I miss those good old days. I really do not think I am ready for college. Everybody here is just so smart. I really miss having people who are dumber than I am in classes. Now it seems I am the dummy. The next time I do this, hopefully I will be in a better mood. My twenty minutes are almost up, and I have ran out of things to say. I hope this was interesting and different from all the other assignments that you have recieved. Bye for now. ",0
836,"Ever since I came to Austin about three weeks ago, the way I think has been sort of different than it used to be when I lived in Houston. I feel more free and independent physically and emotionally. Now that I am no longer in high school I feel that I can be my own person and that no one is judging me. The only time I feel like I have to put on a fake persona is when I am around some of the sorority girls in my dorm. A lot of them seem to be superficial like some of the people I knew in high school. Maybe I just care too much about what other people think about me. Hopefully being in the UT environment will change the way I feel. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, I feel that my mind is freer. That makes me really happy. My roommate just walked into the room, and I am really glad she is my roommate. She is probably not someone I would have hung out with in high school, but since I've been hanging out with her for the past few weeks, it makes me wonder what I maybe missed out on as far as friends are concerened in high school. For example, she is a liberal and I am a conservative, which has begun to make me more open-minded in some of my views. I've also realized how much my parents have been an influence in my life. It feels so strange to not see them everyday like I was used to. I think it is good for me though because separating from them is helping me mature and grow emotionally. Overall, I love college life so far because I am discovering myself and learning about different values that I am glad I am becoming familiar with. I am really glad that I am a motivated person who wants to learn and wants to be challenged. It gives me a sense of reward when I accomplish something I have been working hard on. My favorite subject to study is Calculus because it makes me feel content when I complete a homework assignment and I understood what I did. Especially when I learn and apply a new concept. Even if I didn't understand everything I learned, I go to prof or TA and ask them how to do it. Then I understand the concept and I am satisfied with myself. I don't like English, because sometimes I never feel good about what I wrote leaving me with an unsatisfied feeling. I guess I'm just one of those people that feels complete when I conquer a task. But maybe that's how everybody is. Sometimes I base my self-worth on if I did a good job on something or not. Its self-destructing at times because I am a perfectionist and I tend to have expectations too high for myself. ",1
382,"He'll never live that down  I'm glad I finally got to this website so I can get these essays over with, I still have to write the other one before Friday--I can't wait till homecoming, Natalie is such a sweet girl--I wonder what color her dress will be?  Who else will I know there?  Is it wrong that I'm going back home after just being there this weekend?  I had so much fun with Natalie but I'm very upset with Brooks. I just have to forget about him and continue reminding myself that he's a jerk and Natalie doesn't like him  how could she ever like such a loser   he can't get along with anybody and he brags all the time. If I ever get like that I hope someone tells me and I hope I listen to them. Wow, this is really neat- it's like getting all my feelings out and it's really relieving some stress. Can I swear, I'd better not, I don't want to get in trouble--this is college you don't get in trouble--Tomorrow is my birthday! actually my birthday is in less than an hour--18 years old means I can buy cigarettes, dirty magazines, get into clubs, get into bars--of course, I would never do any of that stuff--only perverts get dirty magazines and I hate smoking--It would be cool to go to a club sometimes but most of the girls you meet there are pretty easy---I like Natalie so much--I was going to be really upset if she didn't ask me to homecoming--Even though I'm at college and surrounded by a bunch of really cute girls, I would rather be talking to Natalie than any of them. This was the first time we actually spent multiple days in a row with each other. her mom is so old-fashioned--""you saw David yesterday so you don't have to see him again for a long time""  Well we went to a football game Saturday, Chili's on Sunday, and bowling on Monday  I bowled so well 156--that's like the highest I've gotten in 2 years--she's just good luck I guess  I'm so lucky to have supportive, caring parents   they have taught me that school comes first so it is not really that hard for me to be away from home and I don't have too much trouble getting myself to do homework. that stupid lab stuff is due tomorrow. no maybe it's due Friday   I wish I didn't have to take ch 204  it looks like it's going to be the class to give me the most homework   I heard it was a weed-out course for Chem E  I don't really feel that much stress right now--I should be really scared about not making it as a chemical engineer because my dad, uncle, and sister are all chem e's but I know I can do it and I know the only way I won't make it is if I don't  study   I can't wait to be 18  I can finally get a credit card-- if I get a credit card will I spend more money?  I doubt it I have check cards and they're the same thing  I've got to stop eating out so often   dad is paying for all my meals at doby and if I'm too lazy to walk over there it's my own fault ---lazy--am I gaining weight?  the freshman 15--would Natalie still like me if I were fat?  I don't think I'll get fat--I can always diet  I lost 20 pounds just 2 years ago    boy I hope my parents buy a smaller house so they can get me a car  I wonder if they'd ever get me a camaro  probably not ""no 2 door cars you can't get groceries in them""  how often will I be putting groceries in my car anyway?  boy I type pretty fast  I could be a court whatever it's called who types what everyone says--that would be such a scary job  if you ever got behind how would you ever catch back up again?  has it been 20 minute yet  I think so  ",1
961,"This assignment is kind of hard. I'm not used to just writing doen wat comes to me. I'm sitting here trying to write every thought in my head but my mind seems to go blank when  I don't want it to and runs a million miles a minute when I;m trying to pay attention in class. I should be in Clarksville with friends a beer and bbq. I need to go skate more. School is to time consuming. I don;t even Know if I really want to do it. The work is frustrating. I don;t mind going to class but I hate all the outside reading and homework. It's not even that I dislike reading I just want to read what I want to read not some course related book. The Story of B is one of the most intriguing books that I have ever read and I havent even gotten through 1/4 of it yet. Maybe I like it so much because of the character. He's not sure of many things and that's exactly how I feel. I want to be liked but at the same time I hate contact with most people. I think most people arent worth talking to. Theyre dumb, they have nothing to say. ITs pointless. People suck. Writng this out is strange, these are things I should keep to myself because I don't even know if I truly believe what I'm saying or if I;'m just getting angry again. I do get angry to much. maybe I should quit smoking. I know I should but its hard. I had no problem on the trip but that was because I couldnt get any I just can't do it around the ville, we smoke to much for sure, throwing money away but fuck money I sit here and stress on how much money I take out of my savings and then in the same instant say to myself I don't give a fuck about money fuck money I should have been born a long time ago when you provided for yourself and if you couldnt hunt of fish then you were in trouble fuck vegetarians self righteous think that because they don't eat meat they are somehow above me fuck that If we didnt eat meat id die I need to stop worrying about girls so much to I always say I don't give a fuck  whether I'm seeing anyone or not but I'm always thinking about girls typical I need to get out on my own and figure all these things out I should not worry so much but I do at least I have music and my boys and skateboarding who cares I don't go out as much I still love it just as much at least I think I still do but I can definitely see myself drifting away its probably because I smoke to much that shit kills you, your energy and your drive yet I love it so much and I can't quit obviously this is a big thing to me because I'm always stressing on it and fuck stress wwhereever it comes from I wish I could destroy stress does nothing except cause problems I try to be stress free but its impossible especially with school always looming over how much do I reaaly want to go to school I don't know I know I could go and make a living without school and maybe I shoul because I'm tired of getting all this ""knowledge"" that isn't applicable to anytihng outside of ut of course the shit is expanding my mind and view of the world right fuck that I live in texas and I don't really care about to many other places why should I  ",0
1575,"     I am feeling a little worried right now about my classes and how well I'll do on the tests and other assignments. I'm used to the class settings now but it's still a little strange to me to be in a class with 100 or more students. I wonder how I'll do in my biology and chemistry classes next semester because I've already heard how difficult it is. I'm stressed out with college work due to the daily reading assignments and I have to take notes over the material for my future exams. I wish I was a senior so I can get out of this place and not have to study ever again! I miss home and I wish I could go visit sometime soon. But of course I can't because I have tests and other things coming up. I can't wait until Thanksgiving so I can go home and relax with my family and friends. I wish I knew more people here or at least have some close friends. I haven't been able to start a conversation with anyone in my class. It's probably because I'm shy and afraid to go up to a stranger and just casually start a conversation. I really do miss my high school friends and I just wish I was back in high school. It was so much easier and more fun. Oh well. . everyone said college is going to be the most fun and memorable part of your life. After attending the Tuesday night bible study, I felt really happy and greatful that I got to meet such nice and open-hearted people. The praise was great and I liked the prayer time too. I haven't prayed to God recently and it gave me the opportunity to communicate with him again. But I felt guilty because I don't pray to God like everyone else on a regular basis. It seems as though I only pray to God when I need help or feeling worried and sad. I should continually pray to him from now on because it's important that I establish an existing relationship with him. I'm glad tomorrow is Friday! Yay!! I only have 1 section tomorrow and then I'm free until Monday. Hopefully I'll have a fun weekend unlike last week when I just stayed in my dorm and study. ",0
1011,"Right now I am feeling very tired. I have a nervous feeling in my stomach probably because I am going to meet a guy that I've had a crush on this friday. I am kind of upset that my friend from chicago hasn't called me. I am also nervous about the semester, because I am hoping to bring up my GPA since I didn't do so well, last year. My second year and already I feel like my classes  are just going to give me a lot of trouble. I'm still on basics and at times I feel dumb because I should already be in my upper division courses. I am motivated again to do well and I feel that everything I am doing so far is going to get me to where I want to be. I have exercised, studied, relaxed, etc. What else do I need to achieve my goal. I want to get into med-school and become a doctor. But, I also want to finish as soon as possible. I miss my family, but I don't miss the rules that they give me. My parents are good parents, don't get me wrong, but I still disagree with a lot of the rules. I guess everyone raises their kids differently. But in a way they have me scared. Scared, to go out to clubs with my friends, or parties or any other social activity that happens at night. Mainly because they would always tell me that it wasn't me they didn't trust it  was the ""people out there""  So, that freaks me out and whenever I do go to clubs or anything I'm always paranoid that someone is going to have a gun and just start shooting. Or an even worse thought is that I might somehow get hit by a drunk driver. Whatever happens in the world that makes the news and freaks out my parents is what I'm afraid of. Maybe, that's how they wanted it. I'm still a pleasant person to hang out with, don't get me wrong, but sometimes I just worry too much. Back to the feeling tired bit, well this past weekend I went home for my sisters birthday. It was a surprise. She gave me a big hug. And it made me feel really good, because me and my sister are always fighting. And going away to college has brought us closer. She is 15 and I'm 19 so it's a big age difference. Anyway I went to her party that my parents had for her and I slept about 5 hrs. the entire weekend. I got home Monday morning and slept all day. And about being nervous well, sometimes I always have that feeling. And usually I can explain it, but there are times when I don't know why. I like this guy James from Chicago, the one who hasn't  called. And since I've met him, I can't seem to stop talking about him. I catch myself talking about him as though he's made a big impact on my life. And really he hasn't. So far everyone I've met has heard about him and my roommates are tired of it. But I can't help it, so lately for everyone's sake I've been keeping quiet and trying to talk about other things, but I still have him on my mind. ",1
801,"well I don't know what to say but I think I should start by sayin I'm really beginning to appreaciate the little things of life. I always have but learning about the body is facinating. the brain especially. there have been times when I feel things and wonder, but I'm now getting some answers due to this book. the class we havnt learned much but the book I've gone ahead. i think about all kinds a things. mostly music and social justice. besides psyc, I got bio which is boring so far but I know I like it . my other classes r mexican american study classes which are all intertwing, or overlap. i think college is coo so far, but for other people I'm sure its harder for others. u se e I've always pretty much been alone, besides my mom. my parents divrced when I was 3, and ever since then my father figures have been in a almost constant shuffle. from my stepdad, to my uncle, to a rapper that I consider my biggest influence, and the last 15 years later my dad. i feel alota anger deep down but have always been able to control it. most of the  time but we all have outlashes I guess. now I am just starting to reach a stable state,,I'm here finally,,no more anticipation,,I'm off weed and drinking,,but the main issues are always family and my lady. shes still in san jose, ca where I'm from. i don't know if I should be faithful or what but I think so. weve talked about a lot a things in our year together and I've taen a lot a shit out onher. i miss every1 a lot but I'm a strong person that can overcome it. always have. adversity is a part of my life that I take in stride. u have too. i see all these others here adapting and hardly any look happy,,they look all fake but maybe its just cuzz I'm on the outside just the way I like it. i'm a chicano here and it seems 90% are all white and 5% asian, 4% black , and 1% other. i also don't like it cuzz I havent really been far from campus cause no car and its to hot to take the bus. I love the bus cause I get to see all the poor people that I love associating wiht. the other homeboys and girls in the struggle or the older mexicans. u can learn a lot from talking to strangers or just observing. thats what I've always done at home and I look forward to doing it here. thats y I came here instead of miami,,cause theres mexicans here. i got a lota pride and love for my people. thats y sometimes my relationship tears me apart. my lady is white. i don't know how it happened,,we started as nothing and ended up being perfect. but llike everyhting I think theres a reason and I know if its meant to be I can work through it. i liked the part of the text that talked about anger and the balence of hapiness we all achieve,,,money doesn't make any1 better. in y opinion its almost like it makes potentially good people worse. but theres always exceptions. power is the other main curropter. or do people currupt power,,,who knows. i've always known that sensations were the vary things to guide ur life. they come from somewhere and I couldnt say where. i think god. gods everywhere. i don't go to church but in my heart I'm going the right direction, doing the right things. thats y u feel what u feel. ur direction and what u want to become. people don't realize that. and sometimes unfortuanatly people are very impressionable. especially in our society, putting aside color, gender, socioeconomic, everything,,,theres very few people that fight through it. i know iam 1 but I also know its harder to stay on top than just getting ther . i look forward to proving that I belong here ",1
1627,"     I was a little nervous about writing for this assignment because I've never really done anything like this. So i decided to put it off until the last minute. It is now twelve twenty-three on the night before its due. Im really beginning to get nervous about the whole college experience. So far I havent really met any new people that I would actually fraternize with on a regular basis. I think the main reason for this is that so many of my friends from high school are attending UT. It is a lot easier to just hang out with them all the time than to bother with the trouble of making new friends. Although I know in the long run this will not accomplish one of my goals in coming to college, which is to make new diverse and long lasting friendships. I don't know I guess will just have to see how things turn out. One thing that I am really happy about is the fact that my girlfriend also goes to college here. In fact she is a mere stones throw away in LLD. She means alot to me and during this time of insecurity it makes things a little easier. I mentioned LLD well that is a girls dorm, near LLB which is my dorm Whitis court that I now call home. Whitis is a nice little community although I don't much enjoy some of the company here. The rooms are nice and very spacious unlike in Jester. However its still kind of hard to think of this room as my own. It seems like a room in a hospital or some mental institution, with its industrial white painted walls and linoleum floor. I guess its just one more thing Ill have to get used to. Not only is the new college experience making me uncomfortable right now. I am also planning on joining the Marine Corps and going to the PLC course this summer. It is a big step  in my life and im a little unsure about it right now. My father was a marine and his father was in the army and I feel somewhat obligated to serve my country. One thing that I would like to accomplish in my life is making my father proud and i think that is perhaps one thing that could. Me and my father didnt have the greatest relationship this past summer before i went off to college. It seemed like he was pushing me away and out of the family. I know he loves me but i guess thats just the fathers way of letting go. Hopefully this time apart will do our relationship well. He came into town for a job interview the other day but i didnt get to see him, it was a little upsetting. I really do love and care for my family but I believe they think much to the contrary. I guess I don't show it very well, or give them much common courtesy. This short time away from home has made me realize how much they do for me and how much I miss them. ",0
1001,"Assignment 1 It is 12:00 am and my mind is very tired. It has been a very long and exhausting day, and I can't believe this is only the second day of class, I have a long way to go, hopefully Ill be able to handle it. It seems as if I don't feel like thinking, my mind feels lazy as if it has been asleep this whole summer--I need to wake it up and make it start thinking again--like I did back in highschool. --or at least back before my Senior year when I didn't really do much thinking at all. I hope tomorrow goes good and I am able to get all the stuff I need to get done. I'm kind of worried that I am not going to be able to manage my time while I'm here--like sitting here right now at midnight where no one knows where I am, kind of scares me. I have the freedom to do what I want now, and I hope I can still make myself do all the things I need to. I am also worried right now--walking back late at night by myself. It scares me to think of what might happen to me. But some things have to get done, and you just have to do them. I really would like to go to sleep right now, I think my tiredness is interferring with my ability to think about this writing assignment. Maybe I should have waited until I was a little bit more awake. Or maybe, I think better when I am tired. I don't know. My mind is blank right now, and I am feeling a little anxious that I am not writing what I need to be writing about,and that some how who ever is reading this will not give me credit because I didn't follow the assignment. I wish I could go home and sleep in my bed and my house, I am getting a little bit homesick. I already miss my family at home and all my friends. It gets lonely up here, when you don't really know to many people, sometimes I feel like I don't belong here and that what I am majoring in is totally wrong for me. I feel like I won't be able to handle Calculus and some of my hard classes. But, I know I have to. I don't really have a choice right now--I have to at least finish out this semester and see how things go. I hope my roomate isn't worried about me, she left here about and hour ago and I told her I would be there in a little while. Oh well, she probably just fell asleep or something. I am feeling kind of anxious right now--I don't think I like being here by myself--I don't know what it is. I feel anxious a lot--I should stop worrying about things so much. Well the 20 minutes is up. The End ",0
263,"Okay here I am after I've been spending tons of time trying to get a book I need. I'm not worried about it anymore. I will focus on my other homework. I need to go to the lounge and get organized before lunch. Maybe I won't eat lunch. Tonight I have a party to go to and I am excited. I need to tell my friend what time we will leave. Where will I park? Maybe we should walk, but it will be late when we come home and very unsafe. The radio is on and I'm listening to country music. It's so great and calming. comforting--reminds me of home. I am going home tomorrow. I can't wait to see my two dogs and possibly go swimming in the pool. I will also help my mom get the new restaurant organized. Sleep is a priority as well. Oh, and I'll see my friends and be able to talk locally on the phone for a change. Wow, I forgot about the chance that I will get a home cooked meal. I need to get some more clothes from home and do my huge load of laundry. I'll come home Monday evening. I need to wash my car while I'm there. I hope my roommate is occupied enough while I'm gone. She can come home with me another time. I hear people in the hall all the time. It's amazing how many are up as early as I for an 8 am class. No one talks, it's like a march to a funeral or something. without the tears and gloom, just the silence. My eyes burn because I'm so tired. I took an hour nap yesterday, but I don't have time today. I can't get my Ethernet hooked up right and it really makes me mad--I'm VERY frustrated. very chapped! I am getting uneasy now; sitting here typing this is making me realize all of the things I  need to do. I know though that I can get it done, just one thing at a time. Plus, I am doing one of those things right now. I wonder how many people here are close enough to home to go visit. I'm an hour away, not bad. I hear this song ""looking for love in all the wrong places"" and it reminds me of Eddie Murphy on the old Saturday Night Live. He did Buckwheat impersonations. I have an ache in my neck either from lack of sleep or carrying heavy books. I hope this doesn't sound like a letter. I am beginning every sentence with ""I"" but that's okay because I am supposed to notice how ""my"" thoughts flow. I wonder who ever got this computer stuff--internet, websites, etc. --started in the very, very beginning. Hmm, well, it doesn't matter that much to me. I just wish I could get my Ethernet hooked up. I like America Online, but it's tying up my phone line. That is also making my anxious right now. I guess the faster you type the longer the paper. I wonder what the other students doing this have to say. I wonder who will take their classes seriously and not. I hope I get some mail soon. I check it everyday and it's sort of depressing. I know people are writing/sending mail, but it just isn't here yet. That's my optimistic side. I hate the cold floor under my desk. I'm in jester, but I have carpet that I brought to go between the beds. I'm thinking of my friend in Alaska that will come at Christmas time. Will we have time for me to show the good stuff about Texas? My throat tightens to think of it. I stress easily. I feel a pressure to make his time here the best and to make him leave here thinking that Texas is the coolest place to be. It won't be as pretty in December though. Great, I have about 5 more minutes. My hands are slipping off this  tiny space. I have no room on my desk. I want to get a huge piece of plywood and cover it with contact paper and make a huge desk--like the people down the hall. It would be so ideal. I am getting really anxious to go to the study lounge. I feel like I'll lose the urge to do my math homework if I sit here any longer. Oh, I can't wait until the party. Matchbox 20 ( my favorite group) is going to be there!!!!! I need to remember to take my camera. I also need to iron my shorts and pick out a shirt to wear. All of this by 4 PM--I believe that's when we'll go to the sorority house and hang out a bit, then get our wristbands and head over the block party. Well, my leg is falling asleep and my eyes are really getting tired now. I wish I could go to sleep. I hate it when I can't focus because I'm so tired. I value sleep more than money it seems. If that makes any sense. I am ready to go now, I feel the pressure of having too many things to do. I will take care of my math homework first. Then biology and art history. Psychology is halfway done now, but I need to get the book. no one has it. That is also causing a little aggravation. I hate to not be fully prepared for everything. Okay, my 20 minutes are up, I feel better having done this. ",1
2130,"wow I really need to shower but I'm going to go work out later so that is ok. maybe tim will come and abbey and mike, they would be so cute. I don't know though but I'm glad tim called me yesterday. the flowers aunt michelle sent me are getting old where should I put them, I guess in the waste basket thing by the stairs. I wish I could use those but every time I go down for lunch you can't get in from that staircase, its annoying. I'm really hungry. I was not supposed to eat the snickers and kit kats but I mean I practically had vegetables for lunch so its ok, plus its the weekend soon and I don't want to waste it. I forgot to go draw my tickets, I never know when to go. I should look it up soon but I can't go now because sunny and abbey have not given me their IDs and its probably too late anyway. and lets see only like an hour till psychology, I want to sleep but ate the candy so I'd stay awake and its working I mean I'm a little tired but not too much. I went to bed around like 1 last night but I wanted to study more, but my roommate was sleeping and she gets mad or annoyed sometimes when I turn on the light, like its a spotlight on her or something. anyway kinda pisses me off and I have to do everything in the dark which takes forever, I have to brush my teeth, take my pills, do my nose drops, lots of stuff. and then she wakes up really early - well she had a class, but she didn't wake up to her alarm and I did. and then when she left it went off again and I still had an hour to sleep before I had to get up to get dressed. it was cool though. my room is nice and clean now, the maid lady came because she forgot to come yesterday. I can't really do this if my roommate is in here, oh well. she is about to come in, I hope I can focus! this is really hard to think of things to say because I have never really paid attention to my stream of consciousness. I don't know if I'll be able to draw my tickets tomorrow because my classes are in the morning and I don't know what time it closes. probably all sold out anyway, so many people here. but its funny because I'm not meeting as many people as I'd like to, but I have only gone to like one frat so. I'm glad I met tim though, that was kind of random and he is really cute. and abbey seems to like mike, who really likes her, and they would be cute too. but abbeys is either changing a lot or living a lie, she goes to frats like 4 times a week, its crazy. and I have been friends wither her for like 10 years so I know she procrastinates so I hope she gets her work done. I don't think she is though because she always says she has hw and then leaves to go party or something, whatever though. we might go get coffee later at barnes n noble, its such a far walk. I don't need coffee either but I think abbey thinks I'm mad at her so I'm going to go anyway and just study I guess. I mean I knew college was a lot of studying but I didn't think it'd be this much. maybe because I'm such a slow reader. I only read about 20 pages per hour. and in the textbook its only 10 per hour. its so slow and so many pages. I finally finished the psychology homework like 2 hours ago, it was sort of interesting but I hope the next chapters are better. I don't think I'm retaining anything. which is bad because I read for so long that you'd think I'd be learning it. I get psychology confused with philosophy and then can't seem to remember either of them. but in class I listen and I get it, then after I try to think about it and all my classes run together. yesterday was especially bad because I got my first grade on a calculus homework assignment. I made a 71 and it really pissed me off because I worked so hard and asked the teacher assistant for help but he gave me the wrong answer and I trusted it. he also didn't do some examples on the board correctly, which made me get another one wrong. today he was all ?oops? yeah it made me mad. but oh well I can drop it according to the syllabus that I don't have printed out. I hope whoever reads this does not think I'm a psycho or anything, or can't spell because its either a typo or I just don't spell well. I really am a good student though and I'm really sad about the calculus hw because it was my very first college grade and I have been waiting for all my hard work to pay off, and it sucked. I was in the bathroom at kerby lane and I cried when I told my dad, I always do that. its good that I have bangs now because if I were to cry or not pluck which I need to do, you can't tell that much. I'm funny about crying, I do it when something really touches my heart, which is kind of often I guess. but pain wise I'm pretty tough, I played basketball for so long. I'm so accident or injury prone. I swear I always get hurt. at the football game that hurt so much when I stepped on that glass I think there was still some in my foot but beth said there was not. it does not hurt anymore so that is alright. I just hope everything goes well for me I mean I really wanted a 4. 0 gpa but now I'm scared. maybe being scared will hinder my performance, so ill stop worrying about it and just trust that I'm smart enough. twenty minutes is almost up.

2120,"So I'm a little nervous because I don't know what to do about my fig meeting today. I'm supposed to have it at 3:30, but last week no one was there. I can't decide if I want to go back  out into the heat or just skip it. I wonder if it can count against you if you skip a fig meeting. I feel so stupid about being nervous to email the instructor. I am so excited about this wrist band thing. I wonder who I will go with to the OU game. I can't believe it is so soon. I'm freaking out. I hope I get a date. Lets see. I promised to get me, Patty, and Kelly a ticket so I can get three more for other people. I can't believe I am actually seventh in line. I hope the guy wasn't tricking me or lying to me because then I would feel really stupid since I've told a lot of people. Oh well. I don't even know what to right on these things. I really wish I was taking a nap right now. My thoughts don't flow as easily when I am being forced to right about them. And I really don't want to say something that could some how embarrass me. although I do that enough anyways. hmmmmm. This class seems like its going to be really hard. I am so confused about what my major should be. Why in the world did I choose advertising when I really don't think I have any interest in it at all. I wonder if its ok that I'm not capitalizing my I's"". I'm so used to instant message typing. it gets hard to used apostrophes and capitalize words. oh well. I hope my cousin is doing ok at her new school. I feel so bad that I haven't talked to my parents so much since I've been here. I don't know if I have even called them twice. That makes me sad, I just feel like I don't have any time. Man , I really want some Kerby queso. maybe I'll get some later. I need to get this printer fixed if I want to be able to print anything out. Dang it. I wonder if I need to print out a confirmation sheet for this. Wait that is just for the pretesting. which was extremely long. I wonder if we can backspace on this thing. hah. I'm so excited about this weekend's ""white trash party"" my phone is ringing. I wonder if I should pick it up huh. I guess Ill just let it ring and listen to the answering machine and see if it is someone important. dial tone. ok and now my cell phone is ringing. ill just look and see who it is. of course its patty. its always Patty. I can't believe I got a yellow wrist band!  Its so awesome. It really annoys me how I always press the Caps Lock button when I'm typing. I think I do it like once a minute. I must be the worst typer in the world. It really grosses me out to find my roommate's hair all over my floor. I don't know why she can't just pick up the dust buster once in a while. Oh I need to unlock my door so patty can get in. Oh well, next year's living arrangements will  be better. But that really stresses me out! I can't believe  I have to get my roommates together like before October. How do you even know who are your good friends yet. Well at least I will be with Kelly. I wonder if Patty is going to want to room with us or if she is just going to want to get her own group to room with. I'm sad Kristin is not going to get an apartment. I don't know why she wants to be an RA. It just seems like way too much responsibility. Oh well. Man I'm hungry , and it is a long long time till dinner. That sucks. Oh good, I thought I lost my Advertising syllabus. but its on my desk that is good. OH yah, I have to go do study hours tonight. That is good. That means I don't have to do my homework now. Maybe I can get in a little nap. Or maybe I should see if my fig is meeting today. I really should work out some. I have totally fallen off track on my working out. It totally stresses me out that I'm probably going to gain like the freshman 45. That is going to sucks. Oh well at least its better than being 85 pounds like last year. Maybe I shouldn't write that on this. Oh well, I tell everybody anyways. I just have like absolutely no motivation to work out. They are right about one thing. Gregory might be close, but your bed is so much closer. I hope my parents aren't like shocked when they see me again. lol. Where is Patty. She called like five minutes ago and it definitely doesn't take that long to ride the elevator 4 floors. Maybe she wanted me to bring her down my book. I need to tell her I will need it tonight during study hours. She will probably be upset. Its my book though. I really need to put away some of this clean laundry. What am I going to wear at the White Trash party. I don't know if I really have anything for that. I guess I should go to Walmart and get a wife beater or something trashy like that. I really want to wear a trucker hat. Ill borrow one. Okay here she is. F ",1
415,"I already wrote a 20 min passage for this assignment. Unfortunately, when I tried to submit it, it didn't work. There was some sort of error and now I am having to redo the entire thing. So basically, I simply feel frustrated that I have to redo this assignment when I could be using my time for something much more useful than this. Beyond that, my thoughts are concentrated on my future. I am currently trying to decide what I am going to do with the rest of my life. I feel as though this is a very big decision. well, it is! My decision today is going to affect the sequence of events for the rest of my life. My career choice will determine what kind of people I meet and what kind of contribution I make to the world, and what the value of my work will have. It is important to me that I make a good decision. For this reason, I feel a lot of pressure to choose wisely and not rashly. I want something that will be viewed as impressive and intelligent. I suppose this shouldn't really be a factor. After all, isn't the most important thing that I am satisfied with my job? The opinions of others shouldn't influence me. And yet, I want people to think that I am intelligent. I can't help it. That is just the way I am. Perhaps I have a bit more of Peter Keating and a bit less of Howard Roark in my than I would like. Another important factor is the value of my work. I would like to have the satisfaction of contributing something useful to the world. For example if I were a microbiologist, I could work in the medical field to find a cure for a disease. Another important factor is money. I would like to say that money isn't important. However, this is a lie. I want very much to make enough money to be able to enjoy life. I want to be able to order food at a restaurant without considering the price. I want to be able to go on vacations every year. I want to see the world. Of course I need someone to have fun with while I do these things but that would fill up an entire additional 20 of writing if I went into my thoughts on social and antisocial feelings. The underlying point here is that I want to have money to do things that will help me enjoy my life. If these were the only criteria, I think I could find a job fairly easily. The real clincher is the next criterion. I want to enjoy my job. I know that some people think this is not important, my dad being one of those people. However, I don't want to spend the rest of my life in a job that I am going to hate. I don't wan t to get up in the morning and dread going to my job. I don't want to have to drag myself out of my bed. I am going to spend many hours every week at my job and so I want to make sure I enjoy it. Not only do I want to enjoy it, I want to make sure I choose the career that I will enjoy THE MOST. Perhaps this is the reason that I find it so difficult to make a career decision. I feel as though I am currently being productive in my career quest. I added a class this semester that will allow me to explore engineering and determine if I might possibly love a career in architectural engineering. If not, I have determined that I should remain in the college of natural science because that is where I will find a courseload that interests me the most. Surely if I choose a major that interests me, a career that interests me will be a corollary. ",1
1099,"I feel so tired. I was so awake until I walk into calculus in which the voice of the professor just made me want to close my eyes and fall asleep. Then my mind kept wandering. The year has just begun and I'm realizing that work is just going to get worse. I have to write a rough draft for RHE 306 that will be due next Monday. I have to start working on that. Then I have to remember that after Rhetoric and Composition that I have to cross the South Mall and go to the Mezes building so I can sign up for some experiments for Psych class. I would rather do experiments instead of writing a 5page research paper. Then my mind always wanders to this weekend. It will be a special weekend because it will be the onemonth anniversary of my boyfriend and me. I don't know what to get him. I have to remember to ask my best friend for suggestions. He's my first boyfriend ever and he has done so much for me. I don't know what I would do without him. I am so happy that my first boyfriend is someone special because I've heard of first boyfriends that don't mean much other than they're their first boyfriends. Then again, most girls have had their first boyfriends when they were as young as in grade school. I'm in college now. It's a little different I would think. Now, what do I get for him? It's such a hard question to answer and I'm low on cash. Well, I'm not low on cash, it's just that I'm given a $20 allowance for each week and I've already used up 3 weeks worth of allowances in less than a week. I need to be able to budget my money more. Then I've been using up my dining dollars faster than I should be. I'm about $40 under than where I should be. I'm really not good with keeping track of my money. Then I have so much reading to do in all my classes. The only class that doesn't require much of my time is calculus. Unbelievable! I'm so thankful that I took calculus in high school or I would be so lost because it's hard to understand everything the professor is saying. If I go back to visit high school, I'm going to go thank Ms. Hall for being a great calculus teacher. I went looking through my psychology book and there are so many interesting things in there. There are some funny quotes and cartoons in there. I always found psychology interesting thanks to my psych teacher in high school. That reminds me, I'll have to thank Ms. LeClair too for being a great psych teacher. Oh, looks like time is up!  ",0
358,"I just finished my last class for the day. I sit at he computer for almost two hours without knowing what I wanted to do or where I wanted to go. This is my first year here at UT. My mind is very messed up today. I don't know what I want to do. I would say that I'm kind of lost--confused, worried, and depressed. Usually, the first day of school always seems to be the best day of school for me throughout the years from junior high through high school. However, today, I'm finally in college and for some reason I don't feel any excitement at all like I used to. Perhaps it's because something that's bothering me inside. I don't feel like talking to anybody. I wanted to go to class yet when I arrived to one class, I just want to lay down on the little desk and rest. The day is almost gone by and I still don't know what my destinations are. There are so many things that await me. I don't know whether I should go to parlin to pick up my English portfolio, to go to the library to do my homework, to go to the bookstore to buy my books, or just go home, take a shower and jump right into bed. I don't even know what I'm writing now. I'm just simply typing in what I have in mind now. All these confusions that I have right now. Well, I'm thinking what am I going to do tomorrow. Should I wake up early or should I sleep for another few hours?  I mean I don't have to come to class until half an hour after noon tomorrow!  I hope I could gather my thoughts together soon so that I could determine what is that, that I really want to do. ",0
2149,"wow I didn't know it was going to time it for me that is awesome. I'm just kind of tapping they keys waiting for something to enter my head for me to write down. I'm really getting tired of hitting the backspace key because I keep typing the wrong letters. I wonder if I will get anymore mail, hopefully. Its  kind of fun opening the mail box and actually having stuff in it. I didn't know where the laundry was until last night. It sucks there is nothing cool in the north tower everything is in the south tower and that is too far for me to want to walk. The light in my room is really big and the papers on my bulletin board are waving around from my air-conditioning. Its hella hot outside, I can't wait till october or november when it will cool down. The animation on my beer poster sure is shitty, I definitely got to cover it up with other pictures, I suck at spelling, its only been 6 minutes this really does feel like forever, I really just don't have a lot to say. HA the radio just said hello to me its so polite, I'm trying to decide whether or not to turn it on. For some weird reason my roommate but an empty water bottle inside a drink cup, it kind of reminds me of abstract art, like when homer tried to build a barbeque and ended up with a big pile of bricks with an umbrella sticking out. I wonder if the McLaren really is the fastest road car in the world. I'm pretty fast I think I could beat it. Al pacino looks a little up set its ok though he is about to snort a whole big pile of cocaine, what a crazy guy, all this typing is making me thirsty again. Bottled water is so stupid. Why would u pay for water that somebody else just filled up out of a tap in the backroom when u can get a cup for free. some people are just idiots. People really do look funny when they cross the finish line in races. It really is a lot harder then it seems to put the top on a bottle. I wonder if I will ever use this stapler that I brought. It does make my desk look very professional though. I ate way too much pizza, rolls, fettuccine alfredo and chicken, they all really don't mix. A blue viper is cool. My hair is getting long again if my dad sees me he will be like so son when do u want me to set up an appointment for you to get your hair cut. just because his dad was a barber doesn't mean that he knows when other people need hair cuts. But my grandad did have one of those cool barber poles and my grandma always tells me what each color stands for and says one day when I'm on a tv game show they will ask me that question and I will win lots of money I think the white is for the skin, red for the blood and blue for the veins. I think. I just spilled water all over my shirt I need to work on my mouth hand coordination. but I suppose water is better then throw up. Stupid reed throwing up on my only UT shirt down in cancun. my roommate sure has some girly colored push pins    they are all pastel colors. the freeway is pretty busy right now, I wonder where everyone is going. I really did eat to much, just sitting here typing is making my stomach hurt. I need some tums. They taste like chalk though, yuck even though I have never eaten chalk before I still know what I would taste like, All dry and chalky. it really would be funny if david still went by texas time instead of Maryland time.

8,"I'm really unsure about this assignment because I'm afraid I won/t be able to think of things to say for 20 minutes so I'll start off with why I'm so mad right now. last night Allison, Rebecca, and Stephanie and I went with Paul and trey to go coon hunting because Allison and I went with them last weekend and it was fun, so anyway we drove for an hour to get to Killeen over this bridge that they hang prostitutes from no that was later first we went to this house that was so trashy that Rebecca didn't even want to go inside to use the bathroom so she went outside thatÃ¯Â¿Â½s gross then we drove to the place for hunting and  they made us get in the bed of the truck and trey drove about 50 mph and we were flying all around we played this IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve never game I didn't realize that Rebecca and Stephanie are just like me thatÃ¯Â¿Â½s cool so then we go over this bridge that smells like shit or rotting carcasses or something and we were so scared because Stephanie was telling a ghost story abo9ut a bridge and then trey turned around and we went over the bridge about 3 more times we were so scared then we get to the field and Paul was already being an asshole and they took the dogs out Allison had begun Paul had Jodi and trey had flip and they left the walker bitch spice in the truck so we start walking toward the creek which turned out to be raw sewage and I refused to go any further and Paul screamed at me that I was a bitch and he didn't give a fuck what I did so I went back through the woods with no flashlight so I could get in the truck I have never been more scarred in my entire life I prayed the whole time and I took spice out because I was afraid that I was going to get raped and murdered or something I was bawling and trying to tell my parents through telepathy that I loved them and that I would miss them because I was going to die then I heard a voice yelling my name and asking for help it was trey he was coming back to make sure I was okay I was so happy then about  30 minutes later the others came back, they looked like night of the living dead with briars and thorns all in their hair they told me they wished they'd stayed with me then they got in their bras and panties because their clothes were soaked with sewage and we drove home the whole time Paul is bitching to Allison about everything and treating her like shit I think she could do so much better but she's in love and I told her that but we didnÃ¯Â¿Â½t get home until 4am and I had a 10 class that I've missed too much already but I made it and that has basically what has been consuming me today IÃ¯Â¿Â½m sorry if its not what you wanted.

Why did I pick the keyboard with the loudest keys, oh well can't stop now, There are layers of thought purple dragons just popped into my head when I tried to clear my mind and let the next new fresh thought come in why there are purple dragons lurking in my sub consciousness? I'm not sure maybe it has something to do with the little dragon on my amp, I named him puff, he sits up their and guards the amp, this is sad just looked up and realized how little I've typed, even though it's been constant typing, I had a thought when I was typing that but it got lost when I was typing it, no just remembered, it's that thought are so heavily influenced by environment. and yet they aren't, so many times your thought return to a constant theme that is prominent in your life, for me mainly my music, some other more personal things too, but they are usually shorter term. so many people walk in and out of this lab, probably not the best place to write this but who cares yay, Creed concert in Alamo dome October 5th, Thursday, hmm let's see today is also Thursday I get off at 3:00, it starts at 7:30, sweet, won't have to skip class to go, good thing to cause the class I'd have to skip would be a fish seminar with like 15 people in it and attendance is mandatory. Got to get more people for the geology study group, I just told that girl I was starting one so I could meet her, so I better get one together quick, probably shouldn't tell you that but hey, it's one of the blessings of confidentiality right, ok started at 12:10 it's now lets see (glances at watch) 12:24, six more minutes hmm goes pretty quickly I should do this more, actually I do this just in a different form, Writing lyrics so that they tell a story and yet still rhyme but aren't in a meter but are musical is cool, think third eye blind the last tracks on the first cd, I can actually just get pages and pages of lyrical content that's singable by writing shorthand and tracking emotions pretty nifty stuff, I haven't slipped into that mode in this twenty minutes yet, usually it's when I feeling something or am just pondering something like why something is what it is, mmm want food ok 3 more minutes, whoa the person next to me is a really friggin fast typist the real way to do this would be just to write for 20 minutes down on paper shorthand, you can actually record the thoughts better, how boring can it be to read all of these, actually I wouldn't mind reading a couple, just see what people think and stuff, but I wouldn't want to do 540 of them, yucky. ulp, my time is up, wonder what the next writing assignment is, oh well got to go eat. 12:30 ",0

I'm not overweight, but I really havenÃ¯Â¿Â½t felt good about my body for a couple of months now because I've been away and too busy to go to the gym as often as I used to.

It's been over two weeks since I talked to him last and he had promised to call the next day. I don't even have his phone number so there's no way I can reach him. I swear, that boy drives me mad!  Oh, well, I'm not going to think about him any more. I'm really glad to finally be doing this assignment. I've been meaning to but my computer isn't set up so it's been impossible to do. I am so frustrated with this whole Ethernet thing. I've been to the store so many times and they never have the part I need. Finally I thought about using the computer lab here in Kinsolving. It's really nice as a matter of fact. It feels good to be on a computer again. I miss mine from home even though I wasn't on it very much. I wonder if anyone will ever really read this paper. I think I would laugh at half the stuff I've written. I don't know why I'm telling you these things, you don't even know, or care, who Joe is or that I have a computer. This place just got really full, it's weird how people seem to come in clumps. Have you ever noticed that at places there will be no line and then all the sudden there's a huge long line? That's weird, I think. I miss my dog. He died this summer while I was away in Germany. I just wish I'd given him more attention when I was home. I knew he would die some day, but I just never thought it would be so soon. I miss the meyers. ThatÃ¯Â¿Â½s the family I was with in Germany. They were so nice to me, I felt like part of the family. Not many people get to do all the cool stuff I've been blessed enough to experience. I love to travel, but it's always so nice to be home. I was never bored this summer. That's a first for me. I'm almost always bored. I didn't get any letters today. That's the first time I haven't gotten any since I've been here. It kind of sucks. Sorry for swearing, I don't usually swear. I still have ten minuets to write. I'm running out of things to say. You must be so bored by now. Someone is playing music in the lobby. It's really annoying me. I can't wait to go to sleep tonight. Why am I always so tired. I don't even care if I go out anymore. I'm so jealous of my roommate. She is always doing cool stuff with her sorority and I haven't done much yet. She's really cute. I love her curly hair. We tried to make mine curly but it was more of a wave. It looked good, but I didn't know what other people would think about it. I just realized people could e-mail me down here  That's good because people have been bugging me for my address. I can't wait until my computer is running. I'm so excited for the football game on Saturday, I just hope it's not too hot. I hope we beat UCLA because a lot of my friends are going there and I know that they'll think of me when they see UT and I want them to be jealous that the Longhorns won. That's bad that I want them to be jealous. It's not really what I want, I just want them to think of me. It would be really neat if I could get on TV then they could see me here and know that I'm okay and having fun. I really am having fun, but it sounds so fake when I tell people that, like I'm just pretending or something. ljliujiojkl ",0
427,"What time is it. I need to be at the house at ten. My mouth feels like the sensation you get right before you throw up. They say that Gatorade is a thirst quencher but why does it make your mouth so dry. It is so quiet right now. As I stare at my roommates applied calculus book I am lost in the colors. The bright colors formed in various shapes and sizes make a maze for my wandering eyes. I wonder what I have to write for the other assignment. God, I could really use a shower. It seems like I have been sweating all day. I wonder where my roommates are and what they are doing?   My roommates are slobs. I feel as if I am in a sea of clothes as I sit here on my roommates computer. I wonder if that picture of Bevo was ever really a picture that was taken by somebody or was it all just from computers. If it was a picture that was taken I wonder what that bull was thinking. he was probably thinking how ridiculous humans are. Actually, he was probably thinking where the best area in the pasture to eat grass is. I don't like this assignment very much. I feel like some druggy. Look at the colors man, and all the shapes. I don't know. It's kind of cool to put down on paper the th9ings you are thinking. ",0

1447,"Well after Labor Day weekend I had come to the conclusion that I disliked the college life. Everything had gone so wrong that weekend. The book store sent me home with the wrong book, I didn't have my ""IF"" account so I couldn't check my email, and I bought a twenty dollar calling card that is supposed to be better than the one I had been buying and it was a rip off. The tendollar card had more minutes on it than than the twentydollar card, and to top that off the darn thing only had sixteen dollars on it. So my weekend was just a bunch of carp. I am not exactly home sick, but I do miss my baby brother and my fiancÃ¯Â¿Â½. I went home this past weekend, missed the first football game here, and saw the two people I missed most. It was so cool to be home everybody was so happy to see me, it was great. I am planning on joining a sorority here to keep me busy so I won't get home sick. I haven't really met anyone here yet. The girls on my floor aren't very friendly. When I first got here I was bored out of my mind, but now things are looking better. I am not real in to Sixth Street, but the first week I was here some friends that live here took me there. I got my tattoo on Sixth Street when we were here for orientation. I keep saying we, my best friend and I that is. My best friend is my roommate and she is trying to get me to enjoy it here and not miss home too much. I have to say I do like the fact that my parents can't tell me what to do, and when to be home and all the other things that parents tell their kids to do. I was ready to get away and be on my own. My fiancÃ¯Â¿Â½ is at home going to school there. Hopefully he will come up here next year. We are supposed to get married this summer, but I guess we will have to see what happens. It is so weird to see everyone outside smoking in the middle of the night, and to see people going out at three in the morning. At home we have a curfew, and they are real strict about it too. Other than all that stuff, I am adjusting pretty well to the college life and am learning to love it. Things can only get better, right. I know I made it sound like I just hate it here, but I don't. The weekend at home was enough to hold me off for awhile. That one bad weekend made me think that it was always going to be like that. Next time I will be writing about how much I love it here, and I won' t have anything to complain about. ",0
121,"Okay. I'm in the stupid SMURF lab. there are so many people here. I saw Brian downstairs. Sometimes he worries me. He met a new guy the other day and already had sex with this guy. I don't know if he used protection or not. but it worries me. He's so. so. spontaneous about things. I don't ever really know if he thinks things through. He just does as he pleases which isn't a bad thing. but it can be dangerous. I wish he'd just look at himself and what he's doing and decide if it's the right or wrong thing to do. He doesn't need to be going around having sex with whomever whenever. He knows and I know that he's a whore. It's not a surprise to anyone. But, he doesn't care. so it seems. Of course, I call him a whore jokingly but in a way I'm serious about it. He knows what can happen to him and it sucks that he doesn't care. Man. Men!!! Men suck! Josh needs to realize that I will never be with him again. He thinks things will change. he's so wrong. For two years I had to put up with his shit and all his lies. There is no way in hell I'd ever even give a second thought to going back out with him. He knows he's an asshole and I let him know that a long time ago. How dare he even bring up the idea of us getting back together. He's a 12 year old trapped in a 24 year old's body. He has no idea what a good relationship is and he doesn't know the meaning of trust. He needs to grow up and realize that he can't always get what he wants. and when he can't get it he needs to just give up and move on with his pointless life. I've moved on and he needs to realize that. I'm not there to be at his beck and call and I'm not there to just be there when no one else is. He lost whatever respect I had for him a long long long time ago. Why is it that I always seem to get stuck in the worst situations when it comes to relationships? Hell. let's see my record thusfar: hmmm, Josh is the asshole, Jay was just a jerk, Seth is the only man I ever loved and he's in California, Craig was someone that I could consider a ""summer love"". but he's at another college. Well, screw it!!  I need to concentrate on getting all A's and B's this year so I can get that free plane ticket to anywhere in the US. Plus, I get $50/A!!  I need the money. I'm poor now and I have bills to pay!  Damnit all to hell. bills!!!  Responsibility!!  Yeah, I have responsibilities as an adult but I don't think the 'rents realize that. I'm 19 years old. 20 in April. yet I'm still a little girl who can't do anything right for shit according to them. What the hell do they know?  I'm not living with them now and they don't see how hard I work to get where I am and how hard I try to be social, to get the education I need, and to get a job worth having in this freakin' town!!  It's hard to find a job. but I've done it. And what do they say when I tell them this?  ""that's nice"". What is that? Why don't they just tell me how they really feel. ""Oh, well, that's still not the real world so it doesn't count""  I swear they piss me off. My mom is the worst. She wants to lecture me about dishonesty and all that shit. Well, HELLO! Guess who's fixin' to eat her words!! I caught her smoking this past weekend. Yep. right there by the side of the house puffin' away like a chimney. What was that you said mom?  You quit smoking?  Right. and I was so proud of you!  All that's blown to hell now. So, I caught her. and what did Miss ""Liane, I can't trust you"" do?  Well, she decides to kiss my ass to try and make up for her lie. Yes sir! She bribed me with four 60-minute phone cards and $50. OH and she even told me that I could just pay for my speeding ticket without having to take the class. . Yes, that means it would go on my record but ""oh, that's okay. it's not much more on your insurance. Besides, we just got a load of money back from the insurance company because of our good  driving records"". Oh yeah. she was brown-nosing BIG TIME. I have lost a lot of respect for her for doing that. I don't know whether I should just forget about it and let her do what she will or tell my dad and have him deal with it. I swear. this world is nothing but a big mass of contradictions! I'm not saying that I'm perfect. but I've learned over the past few years about what I want out of life and what I don't want. I'm living my life the way I want to. as stress-free as possible and as happy as possible. When I'm put into these stupid situations it just makes life that much harder and it sucks!  I'm so tired of looking at this computer screen. I think it's about time for me to stop thinking. Yep. it is about that time. Thank God. Now I have to go help Brian with his Spanish work that he swore was gonna be ""SOOOO EASY"". I knew he'd have trouble. and I knew he would turn to me. I'm no bilingual. but what the hell. I do what I can to help my friends out. I've been called ""too nice""? How the  hell can someone bee ""too nice""????????? ",1
2058,"I have a Campbell's soup can on my desk as a pencil holder (a tribute to Andy Warhol) and I am watching it now. My desk is a bit cluttered. purses, markers, papers with assignments that need to be done, a Dr Pepper can. I am unsure what to write. I began a painting today, and did not finish it. my dorm doesn't feel as though it's a creative environment, but I suppose the dorm won't change. so either I have to change my perspective, or not paint at all. My eyes are heavy, and I am cold, because my hair is wet and squeaky clean. My hands are warmer than usual (they are usually as cold as ice, or very near as such), and I shall have to remember to tell my mother, because she would be proud that my blood is actually circulating. It is ten to midnight. My mind is active, but I lack in motivation. I am excited about this new life I have, as a college freshman, but I am also extremely nervous. I MUST do as well as possible this year, so that I won't have to return back home to a run-of-the-mill local college (as my dad has threatened if I don't succeed in producing a pretty-looking GPA), and also my future as an architect (the career which I would like to pursue) is depended solely upon my performance this year. I did not get into the architecture program this year, and should like to transfer in as a sophomore. I have run out of things to discuss. I miss the clutter of my bedroom back at home. I had every possible wall and floor space covered with furniture and the many trinkets that I have hoarded throughout my years as a packrat. I brought only the bare minimum of books with me, my art books, of course, and my absolute fave novels, one of them being A Wrinkle in Time. I am fully aware that it is a young adult novel, and not nearly adult enough to be considered a very intelligent favorite, but it remains dear to my heart nonetheless. My room smells of the body wash I use (Energizing Citrus, I LOVE it) and stale mr. gatti's pizza. there is a faint tinge of acrylic-paint smell. My roommate is also attempting to do her homework and simultaneously clean up our room a bit. My bed is full of pillows, two black hearts and a red furry one, and a very bohemian rainbow patchwork pillow that my mom made for me. I am, for once, not hungry. but merely satiated, as I feel neither full nor the pangs of hunger. I have less than seven minutes to go!  I wonder who the poor soul is who must read this worthless mumbo jumbo. In what way do you benefit from reading this?  I can't imagine how anything could come of this, except perhaps extreme boredom, or maybe resentment. There is this girl that stands at the entrance of my boyfriend's subdivision in Georgetown, holding up an ugly old sign advertising the homes and such, and every time we drive by her, I think: That has got to be by far the worst job in the world. She stands outside in the offensively hot sunshine with a stupid straw hat on, holding a bent sign and a jug of water. And I can only wonder what she must tell everyone her job is: I am a pole. ""  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, with one simple gesture, a stick could be stuck in the ground, and the sign pasted onto it, and it would serve the same purpose as she does and probably do a better job, and yet that poor soul has to spend her day holding it up, and it just kills me. And I am glad I am not her. I am glad I am not a whole bunch of people. The End. ",0
1505,"At the present time, I am content to be writing. It's almost time to go to sleep, and this is very relaxing. I am listening to eminem on mtv. I do not like eminem. I hate to cough. I am coughing because of this stupid dorm room and some studid mold that they think is just the paint doing wierd things. I think that my throat is doing better though, the medication is kicking in finally after about 6 days of torturous soreness. I just talked to Jonathan, he is the greates guy in the world. But i don't want him to think that I am the only girl in the world for him. I think that it is funny that a lot of girls thought are about boys. I just want to have fun this year, and not have a boyfriend. I think it is important to just meet people and have connections with each person you come in contact, but they don't have to be any thing more than at that moment. Its really late, I wish that I wouldn't put things off till the last minute. I have had such a long day, and am ready for bed. My bed feels so good. I love the fact that I am so comfortable in my dorm with my roomates. They are so great, and fun to be with. Chaps is my roommate. I think that name is kind of different, but she like it so I just call her that. I love this song by Michelle Branch. She ironically is talking about saying goodbye to a boyfriend.  That is what I have had to do for the past year. It was incredibly hard. But I hated the way he acted when he left for college my senior year. I felt so guilty for wanting more out of my senior year than having a boyfriend 300 miles away. He wanted more, and I feel so bad. He has some self-confidence issues. I think the fact that I actually was dating him was great for the self - confidence thing. But once we separated, it just hit him so hard. We are really good friends, but I really think he still wants more. Someday, I might also, but not now. I love that the Zeta's symbol is the strawberry and the queen. It is so exciting. I am so excited about organizing my New Member book. I love organizing. It almost gives me some kind of high. To be totally organized, and know where everything is. I need that kind of stability in my life, because I do so much and stretch myself in so many difections. I don't know how I am going to do Sororities, get my GPA up to at least a 3. 8, and do two organizations outside of school, (which is required by Zeta sorority). But I perform best under pressure, so the more the merrier. I am so excited about Texas Spirits, that is the organization that I hope to join, as my organization to have to join. Jessica is in Texas Spirits, and I love her. She was the person that made my decision for Zeta Tau Alpha so concrete in my mind. I dreamed that I was a Zeta the night before i found out which one picked me. I think it was a sign or something. Jessica means so much to me, but she is always too busy with Katie Johnson. Today, she did give me a card with a picture of us in it saying that she is sorry she hasn't been there to hang out with me as much as she wanted to. Zeta is going to be so awesome to be a part of. I love the friends that I have made so far. I just really think that the parties that are involved are a little too numbered throughout the week, I mean they want us to get good grades, and be in all these organizations. Yet they give us all these mixers to go to to meet people which I love to do, but they are on week nights. Oh well, I just am going to have to limit my participation in them. I miss my high school friends. I haven't talk to Rosie in ages, and Casey didn't even say goodbye before she left. I am going to have to send them an email pretty soon. The sound of the mouse and keyboard are such wierd noises. And so are the sounds that come out of the actual computer. I always have wondered what makes the little clicking noises in the computer. I mean is it gears shifting, or electrons being shot out of some kind of machine. I want to know. That is interesting. And I am glad to be done.        ",1
759,"well, today is a pretty easy relaxaing day. I've kinda gotten into the school mood now so it's not too hard to sit down and get stuff done like it was a couple days ago. when I got here I had no clue it was going to be just what I thought is was going to be like. needless to say, I'm happy. it feels just like a movie or something. I'm so lucky to have such a great roommate. she's so awesome. we knew eachother in high school but we never were great friends so it works out perfect. we always can feel free to go our separate ways and always have someone to come home to and share our nights with. we are so much alike and so much different that God sure put us in the right place. we make eachother laugh. she even hooked me up the other night with one of her friends and I had a great time. we were discussing something last night though. we haven't seemed to find our nitch yet. we've met a lot of people, together and separatly, but I guess it just takes awhile to find your friends huh?  I'm not too worried or depressed about it yet. I'm busy as it is. friends will come. I wish matt from orientation calls me. I think we could be really good friends. I'm pretty upset with some of my friends right now. mainly blake. my old best guy friend. we used to be so tight but now he's changed. all he cares about is partying and drinking and keeping an image. it's so not him and he knows it. he is so much better than that and we've even talked about it before. I just care for him and miss him but both of us are too stubborn to call first and stuff like that. we've always been that way. let me tell you, senior year with him was pretty stressful. I just wish sometimes things were what they used to be. don't get me wrong. I absolutely love college but I guess I miss all of the tight friendships I had and my little group at school. but I love everything about college (except for the showers) :)  well, that's it for now. besides the fact that I wish I had some significant other. or maybe I don't. sometimes I wish I did but I still enjoy looking at other guys and flirting and I'm still meeting people now so I guess it's good I'm not tied down. and I'm really excited I found a theater club I could join here. and I don't have to major in theater. I did a lot of that in high school (hated my teacher) but I was a role model to a lot of people and that made it easier to cope with her. I'm so glad that we have email today. it makes it such an easier way to talk and communicate with people. I miss my friends and family the most. I'm not really homesick yet, which is good I think. I think that shows a sign of maturity. I'm not going home this weekend. I know my parents would want me to but I don't really feel like it yet. I propbably will the next weekend maybe. I know I am for our high school's homecoming for sure. I think that everyone from my school that goes here is going back. I think that it will be fun. I loved high school football games. I went to every single one all four years but two of them my senior year. well, it's been past 20 minutes. until writing #2. ",1
1855,"     Today is a very stressful day, I just studied for the first time and it makes me so mad because i am a perfectionist and when I don't understand something perfectly I get really frusterated. My boyfriend from back home has not called today because we broke up last night and it was for the stupidist reason. Why can't he just let me do what I want? I'm kind of homesick lately. People know all their friends from high school and I'm just alone from Wisconsin, besides Shane who is not being very nice lately. Well actually it's me not being very nice. It's really weird because my friends and I all have birthdays this week. Mine's on September 11th and it's not going to be a very fun birthday. It never really is. Two years ago my party got crashed by Richard and then last year it was 9-11. Hopefully it'll be really cool though with everybody remebering 9-11. I think it will. The fact that I have so many classes that day kind of sucks though. Oh well I think I've officially decided that I'm changing my birthday to september 12th. My friends and I are all going to Hardrock cafe that night to eat and then we might go to sixth street and party afterward. I called my mom today just to chat and of course she makes me mad and says basically that her and my dad thought I was going to drop out of school. They wanted to make sure that I had been studying. they don't realize that I am on my own now and that I can deal with my own problems myself. Janelle and I just found this new diet. You eat a lot of fruit in the morning and veggies and then at night you can feast and eat whatever you want. You have to eat in a certain order though at night. kind of weird and who knows if it will work but it better because I'm not going to gain the freshman fifteen. Thats going to be hard because the cafeteria food is so damn good and you can keep on going up for more servings. I palyed on a soccer team today. Our dorm got a coed team together and we all went to practice together. It was a good workout because it was so hot out. It was alot of fun, I scored three goals and I broke Darius' toe. OOPs! I feel kind of bad. I hate the fact that the last 2 weeks all I've been doing is having fun and not dealing with school. Now I realized that there's going to be alot of school wrk involved. I also want to prove my mom wrong and get a really good GPA. I set goqals for myself today because I was reading a book at   Barnes and Noble and I said that I was going to do good in school and study at least an hour a night. Hopefully I can do that. I think I will be able to. I can't believe that Shane hasn't called yet. I either thought he'd call at 10am or not at all. Oh well there's more out there. I am having a lot of fun here though, so I don't really care if we break up.   ",0
2340,"     I smell soy sauce in are hall some girl spilled it all over the place and now you can't be anywhere without smelling the nasty odor. Well I got back from a bible study got to see some people that I haven't seen in a while I suppose it made me feel at home and I actually made plans to hang out with someone I met this summer and haven't been able to see him that much. Anyways I enjoyed it but at the same time I wonder about my relationship with God I suppose it is a thought that always lingers in my mind. Is it strong enough to I pursue him enough am I a good person sometimes I don't know. so I'm listening while I do this music seems to be something that I have always enjoyed the way everything flows together and becomes something more than noise it seems that music in some forms is the perfection of the interpretation of emotions it not only puts words towards your feelings it gives the words syntax by adding in a conglermation of cacophonies that seem to support the words, Now even though some music doesn't appeal to me I believe that if anyone is writing the music backed by emotion and truth or feelings then they have earned my respect if that really means anything but to those who rock you have got my salutations. So lets get real I'm an 18 guy so I do also think about girls quite a bit. Today I thought of a girl in high school I missed and it is always an itching feeling or thought in the back of my head to try to commit to a girl or girlfriend. Even though I don't know what the hell I want to be honest, is that all this world is trying to please ourselves in order to feel worthy, who are we trying to impress. I don't know? but I can't deny my feeling I believe that truth lies in your emotions and that god gives you certain emotions that give you truth in your life. Sometimes I feel that the only thing we have here on this planet is love that's all we have that is really worth any value and if we give it away to others that is the only way to truly fulfill not only yourself but others, Live life love life. So as I continue to right I remind myself that love exist and to give it freely to those who are in my life. I find myself always observing people walking to class its amazing how afraid people are to look at each  other simple glances are rarely seen. what a society it would be if people simply acknowledged each other in life. So many lonely people. What do I like: the smell of rain, the sound of a harmonica and an acoustic guitar blending together like reunited twins, the smell of the mountains the feeling of seeing the sunrise and the gratefulness of seeing it set knowing that were alive and living I met an 80 year man this weekend he told me that life was to good and he didn't want it to end. I agree some people have forgotten that but I hope that one day the world will realize that being alive is the hope that we all have has long as are heart keeps beating there is something to do something to live for, someone to love, something to give, man being a kid was freaking awesome and I could play all day doing something as simply as climbing a tree or hide and seek and it was amazing. I wish I had a glass of milk before I went to bed but hey what can you do. Well there went 20 minutes I suppose I will go a little over to leave a quote from jerry Garcia ""live life to the fullest and in death all you can be is grateful. "" ",0
1200,"That is what I feel I should do first, is give you my social security number to make sure I get the grade for this assignment. Good thing this assignment is based on completion because at the rate I type I do not type much in the time span of twenty minutes. I guess since just in my class alone there is on estimate 550 students in there all of which will be turning this assignment in this week sometime, it makes it practically impossible for you to read through everyone's writing even with the help of your teacher's assistance. You never really think about how many thinks and thoughts run through your mind in just the coarse of a few minutes. Your class schedule for that day, what assignments you need to get done, people you want to hangout with, and even the decision of if you want to do any of these things will cross your mind on a normal day of class with out you really even notice yourself thinking about these things. Baseball has been on my mind for the last few days especially. I have been trying to decide if I wish to play of the Longhorn Club Baseball teams. While on this Thursday I have a tryout for the University of Texas Baseball Team. I guess I figure that I will see how the tryouts go for me on Thursday and make my decision. I really want to play for the UT baseball team but if that does not workout then the Longhorn Club team will be the next best thing. I honestly have a good feeling about my talent and the way the coach sounded on having a good opportunity on making the team as a walkon. Right now just thinking about it gives me a adrenaline rush. Just think if I made it how exciting every game would be. It is a trill just watching a football game just think about it if all those people are in the stands and your apart of the team! Well my time is up so have a nice day. Travis Johnson ",1
115,"As I am sitting in the computer room at the Castillion, I am thinking of how dull and boring this room is. The walls are a dull gray color and I am all by myself. The chairs are scattered unorderly throughout the room. I am now trying to decide about what I should do for this weekend. I told my parents I was leaving here Thursday night but I now realized I have a sorority function that night and also on Friday. I then thought about leaving Friday afternoon, but that would mean missing the UCLA game on Saturday. I also have a sorority field day on Sunday which is not mandatory, so I think I am just going to go home Friday night and miss the game Saturday and also the field day Sunday. My classes this year are overwhelming. I am so swamped with work that I'm worried it will not all get done. When I leave this weekend, I hope to get some studying done considering the Castillion is one big party 24 hours a day and it is very difficult to sleep here. I wish people would take others views in mind and be a little more considerate instead of knocking on your door drunk beyond belief at 3:00am on a Tuesday night. I am going to eat at Subway as soon as I'm finished with this paper because I'm starving and I can't concentrate very well. I have about 7 pages to read in philosophy tonight and about 25 pages in biology. This is such a big difference than in high school when you didn't even have to pick up a book to make an ""A"" in an honors class. I know that some of my friends are going to have a tough time here at UT because their parents were so protective over them and now that they are on their own with 6th street so close, they are going to go crazy. Some already have. My roommate here is great. I grew up with her and we get along very well. I am lucky considering there have been several problems with rooming situations in our dorm. The mail situation at this dorm is terrible. My father sent me an overnight package and it didn't arrive until one week later. The food at this dorm is good though. Well my time is now up and I am going to go eat, finally.              ",0
1071,"My mind is clustered with the nonstop clicking of my roommate's mouse on her computer. It just keeps going and going and going. Then comes the sound of my keyboard keys clicking away. and the sound of my next door neighbor's toilet flushing. I have the sudden urge to tell all the noises to just shut up. I hear the sound of my roommate coughing, and it reminds me of my grandfather, who passed away a few years ago. He died of pneumonia while in a coughing fit. Now I'm thinking about lunch. which I was supposed to have an hour ago. Yet, it is very upsetting because I have no food in the dorm in which I want to eat and the food at the dorms are not quite edible or appetizing. I'm thinking about my boyfriend, and how he'll come visit Austin from Houston this Friday. He'll be coming here to have dinner with me and my roommates at a fancy restaurant. That will be quite exciting considering that I haven't had any great food in a long time. I'm really excited to see him because he lives back at home, where I moved from. This weekend I'll be going to see my parents. When I think of my parents, I get a guilty feeling because I know I haven't been very truthful to them. But, there are just things that I can't tell them because of the generation gap and everything else that occurs between parents and their kids. It makes me feel even guiltier that they miss me and want me to come home, but yet, I don't really miss them yet because I feel restricted in their presence. The sound of water running is making me want to take a shower because it just reminds me of showers. Maybe because I just took a shower. My body feels warm and clean. I love that feeling. The sound of food is calling. but I need to type for another 15 minutes. For some reason. the little eraser shavings on my desk made me think of little insects and bugs. The thought isn't very pleasing considering the fact that I have an extreme hatred for insects. The thought of them makes me itch. Now my eyelids feel heavier and heavier. Writing continuously makes me tired. Speaking of sleepiness, I think of the experiment we did on Monday with the correlation between sleepiness and stress. I was one of the control group people who just sat there. Sitting there listening to all the number counting was like a lullaby. I fell asleep soon after that. Then I woke up to the sound of laughter, and realized that I left a big wet spot on my shirt sleeve because I had fell asleep with my wet hair on my sleeve. It wasn't a great picture because the people walking by might have thought that I drooled all over myself. Not a good image. Speaking of image, I went to rush for a business fraternity yesterday. It felt weird approaching everyone and trying to meet everyone. Usually I am a more inward person and not likely to just go up to people and ""mingle,"" but yesterday I needed to because it was a ""rush"" event. I am thinking that both this fraternity might make me feel more comfortable with meeting people and approaching them, but at the same time. it might not be something I really want to do because I'm not the extremely social type. However, as for now, I will keep on rushing to see how things go. It makes me nervous about joining this fraternity because I know my boyfriend back home will feel somewhat against me hanging around a group of people he doesn't know. It already makes him nervous enough to know that I'm up here at the populated University of Austin, and he's down there back home, in a known environment. So, there are many things to consider about joining these organizations. But like everyone's advice to me: Don't get held down by some longdistance relationship when you get to college. Maybe this is why they gave me the advice. Because every time I go to some party or meet new people, I feel guilty that my boyfriend is not part of it with me. I suppose I get this feeling because he has always been there with me to meet everyone back home. Now that we're in different environments, that is not possible anymore. However, I am still determined to make this relationship work. Now I am really in the mood to go home, and really in the mood to walk up to my refrigerator for some food. One more minute to go. I see Einstein on my computer screen. He makes me want to do well in school. I hope I will do well this year. I feel kind of nervous because there are so many more distractions here, but I suppose I'll learn to handle it. ",1
1511,"     Stream of thought. this is interesting because it seems like i've done this many times on my own. keeping a journal of things i'm feeling or things that have been on my mind, but i can never quite finish a thought before another one pops into my mind. i've been at the chi o house for almost 2 hours today, but wait- instead of studying at the chi o house i spent those 2 hours trying to save an apartment for myself and 3 friends next year. that didn't work because you can't forget to speak to your father when it comes to issues of money (whether it's his money or your own). i'm a little frustrated because i haven't been able to get my computer hooked up to the ethernet service at hardin house yet. ok, very frustrated. i'm even using my roommate's computer at the moment. not that that is a bad thing, but hey, maybe i want to use my own computer!  oh well- she's never here anyway. i kind of like it bc she has all of her classes in the morning and mine are pretty much spread out through the entire day, so we don't see each other that much. it keeps us from getting sick of each other, and we still find the other person amusing when we do spend time together. on the other hand, my best friend from high school- i'm about to scream!  i was so hoping that when i came to ut, a school of collosal size, that it might be possible for me to get away from westlake; branch out; make some new friends; have some new experiences. while all this is taking place, i still seem to have this tie to my high school- her name is robin. she hadn't always planned on coming to ut. as a matter of fact, she wanted to go to baylor with our friend blair (robin is my closest friend, but i kind of wish she had gone to baylor) but one day she just made up her mind and here we are. still   summer and robin   or   robin and summer  . . why can't i just be my own person???  i enjoy having time to myself. don't get me wrong, i am a very outgoing person- i love to meet new people- i even want to dual major in public relations (and photography), but sometimes it's nice to just not have to talk to anyone. to just be alone. this thing with robin has gotten out of hand!  now that she's seen how much fun i had going through rush she wants to rush next year. now that she knows i'm going to do young life leadership she wants to do yl leadership. i drive her to church every morning and then to her house afterwards (it is waaaaaaaaaaaaaay out of the way. but she's my friend, so i do it). i'm signing up to do texas angels next year, so she's going to sign up to be an angel. and the list goes on. i can understand that yeah she may actually be interested in these things- and i'm so glad she's wanting to be involved in things like young life and lake hills church (which meets at our high school by the way) but i need some air. it's even gotten to the point where i actually feel guilty if i hang out with/make new friends!  that's not right!!!  the thing is i know i need to just talk to her and let her know what i'm thinking (maybe not to the full extent) but she has a right to know how spending so much time together is hurting our friendship more than helping it. i just hate to hurt her feelings. it'll work out. i can't believe i'm writing all these thoughts down for other people to see. i'm assuming other people will read this because it's an assignment, but hey. stream of consciousness eh? :)  i've recently been reading this book called   when God writes your love story   and i wish i could spend more time reading it to get it finished. it's really interesting, although often cheezy, but it talks about God being the center of your life and the center of your relationship with members of the opposite sex. the thing that hits me most strongly is when it talks about how instead of pursuing relationships, we should give this area to God and let Him pick out our partner for us. I've known that God has someone special picked out for me, but i never thought of actually backing off and letting God bring him to me. i know He will, but it's hard to not be looking for that someone. yeah. . still a little rusty on the subject - that's why i should actually FINISH THE BOOK! :)  and that's another thing- i have NOT been keeping up with my quiet times recently!  not just recently. it's been quite some time. i want to but there's just not that constant desire you know?  it's something that i need to be praying about. there are lots of things i need to be praying about, such as continued enthusiasm for my studies at ut. i am so excited about all of my classes!  they are ALL soooo amazingly interesting to me, and i hope i just don't get burnt out on any of them. the only class i'm having a big problem with is my biology class. i'm so interested in the material, but my professor just sucks. she's nice, and i can tell she's interested in and excited about the information, but she just doesn't know how to present it in a way that others might find it interesting as well. i've never fallen asleep in a class until this one!  and yeah. . i haven't made it to that 8am biology discussion lab on fridays. it's not like i go out and party (and i don't ever have hangovers then bc i just plain don't drink at all) but i'm such a night person!  actually i dont' know what the deal is. ever since middle school i haven't gone to bed before midnight and now that's more like 2am.  but no matter what time i go to sleep early or late, i cannot for the life o fme wake up the next morning. it's an impossibility. time is almost up i wish there was more time to write though. oh well.

2301,"I am worried about my brother, Bobby, right now. My mother just called me and told me he was in a bad car accident and was taken to the ER. She said he is okay, but they are stitching him up right now. Tonight I went to church with my best friend, Amanda. We sang a lot, which I love. I'm not necessarily the best singer, but I really enjoy it. All the songs we sang tonight, I knew from my church at home in Plano. That made me happy. I also signed up for teams at church. Right now I am a little frustrated though because Amanda and I are trying to do our Art History homework, but the website won't let me download the article I need. Very Frustrating!!!  Oh, I need to go wash my dishes when I'm done with this. Amanda and I made chili-cheese dogs. They were great!!  My roommate, Sijia, is not home yet, and this worries me because it is pretty late, and she shouldn't be walking around Austin alone in the dark. I have to write a paper for my freshman seminar class for Friday on two pieces of music that I have not been able to listen to yet, which frustrates me. I just found out about the assignment today. School is going well though, a little stressing, but all around, it is going well. All day I listened to one of the best songs I have heard in a long time called ""How Could I"". The music in this song is very well played, and the lyrics are really good (sad though), and the lead singer (of oleander)'s voice is very soft and pretty. I have to do a geology assignment for my discussion section tomorrow which is a little stressing because the article for the paper I have to write is about 20 pages long. I didn't get much sleep last night because I was trying to read for Art History because I don't learn anything in that class because it does not interest me at all. I woke up early this morning to look over my math homework. I won't get much sleep tonight either. Amanda has music playing in the background right now, but I don't know who is singing. I like the way it sounds though. Tonight I taught Amanda how to tap dance. It was interesting. we went into my bathroom (because it's really big and has a good floor for tapping) and I taught her a few basics. She and I have both danced our entire lives, but she has never taken tap, so I am going to teach her. She is going to teach me pointe, because I haven't done ballet in three years. I have a bad knee, and last summer I had knee surgery, so I haven't been able to do very many classes the last few years. I only took tap and jazz. I miss ballet though. Since I've moved to Austin, I've really missed dance because I don't have a dance studio here. I would like to go take some classes, but I think it would be better to concentrate on school, at least the first semester, and I can just practice at home. I bought new pointe shoes the other day. We had to walk many many miles to get them. Today in geology class, we played football and sang the UT fight song standing up with the ""hook 'them"" sign in the air. It was a very interesting class. right now I wonder if anyone has IMed me on AIM. I'm really tired, but I won't be able to sleep tonight because I need to do school work. My parents might go to the Bahamas in a few weeks, hopefully I may go as well. I haven't been to a beach in two summers now because of the knee surgery and rehab (for the knee), and this summer we were just too busy. That reminds me, I miss my family in Virginia. Maybe I can fly out there this summer. That would be fun. Virginia is beautiful. The Chesapeake area especially. I'm glad my brother is alright, but when my mother called it worried me. But he will be fine. I cleaned the guest bathroom tonight (I have to do chores around the house because I live in a co-op). Tomorrow I think I'm going to sleep in between classes. I only have two discussion sections. Sijia just got home!!  ",1
859,"I just got back from Houston and all I can think about is getting ready for this week's classes. I had a good time witj my girlfriend and got to spend quality time with my parents. I hope I can get tickets to the Bob Dylan concert next week. I need to study a lot this week so I can keep on top of my classes and not get behind in anything. Thursday night I hope I go to Bob Popular's again. I'ts fun not having Friday classes so I can go out on Thursday nights . I love college: I feel so free; free as a bird: to come and go as I please. I'm doing pretty well in my classes thus far and hope to continue on. UT football dominated Stanford. They didn't have a chance. However my favorite college football team is PennState. They whipped Arizona last week and killed Akron this week -70-24. Now they have their eyes set on Miami in two weeks : and I plan to go on-line and bet about $20 on that game: in psu's favor of course. Hopefully they will win the national championship. I also hope that UT does well because they are my second favorite team. I really need my 4. 0 Gpa this term so I can get into the business school. I don't know what I will do if I don't get in. I am really interested in studying business and hope to own my own business someday. God I miss my girlfriend: I've only been away from her for like ten hours now but I already realize that I miss her so much. We've been going strong now for like a year and a half, and I love her so much. She's still a senior in high school and I hope that next year she will come to UT. She makes good enough grades so I think she can get in. Sometimes I miss my parents but I'm having a good time thus far. I I have made so many friends. Ut is going to kill Rutgers this weekend : but too bad it is in New Jersey. I want to watch them play live since I missed their game last week cause I was back home in Houston. however I did watch them on T. V . So here I sit on this computer at 11:25 typing and typing staring off into space. I wish I knew what would happen in my future, I wish I knew. Who knows : its all in God's hands now. He is the one who will watch over me and guide me on the right path. I am taking creatine while I work out. Since I started taking it I've gained 10 pounds of muscle. It might be bad for me in the long run but for right now its worth it ",1
1893,"     I'm just sitting here by the computer thinking of something to   write about. I just finished my Inorganic class, met a really nice guy   who is now my partner for this, however he is married. Two of my   friends are sitting in this same room, talking about math problems.  Man, am I glad my math requirement is over and done with. I'm also   so worried about my med schhool application. Is this what I really   want to do with my life? On the other hand, do I not want to go ahead   and try? Will I regret it if I give up? Will I regret it if I don't? Sometimes   I think all I'm afraid of is hard work. When I think about applying to   grad school, I start to worry about how hard it'll be to my phD   dissertation! Talk about borrowing trouble. I don't want to disappoint   mama, she does so much for me, but no matter how hard I try, I feel   that she's never satisfied with who I am, even though she always   says she is. I'm glad she came to visit me this time, but I'm also so   scared of disappointing her. If she ver knew I got that C for math. ! I   keep thinking about Sulanka a lot too. Mama said continuously that   he wasn't the right man for me, deep down I know that too,  so why   am I still with him? He always puts me down, and I know half his   compliments and   lovering   is not sincere. Maybe it's the sheer   convenience of livjng together. Although sometimes I wonder what   the hell's so convenient about it! He makes me spend my money   like there's no tomorrow, I've cried more times with him than at any   other time of my life. However, I've also spent the last six and a hlaf   years with him, so there must be something I need that I'm getting   from him. It's hard to let go of something you've had for so long even   if you know it's not very good for you. I like meeting other guys   though, and it comforts me to know that even if I did leave him, I   needn't be alone. Sometimes I think I'd rather be a little prettier than   a little smarter - like I have a choice! But if I did, I think pretty girls   have an easier life than the smart girls, for the simple reason maybe   that pretty girls don't have much to think about. I used to alwasy envy   the pretty girls at school, even if they were younger and dummer than   I was! It was a shock to realise a few years ago, that they had all   been jealous of me. I sure do miss high-school. Sometimes I think   that was the happiest time of my life -even with all the ons of   problems I had. Living at home with mama and Poppa was so hard   sometimes, but I had my friends, and it seems as if even Sulanka   loved me more at that time. To be fair, he also didn't see me 24   hours a day when we were in high-school either! I loved hanging out   with my friends, I've never laughed so hard as when I was in   highschool. It was nice being known by everyone. I miss my click, I   can't wait to see Ash and Ramee and hopefully Sashi in the winter.  I'm sure Senny must be going through the same things now. I feel   so bad for him, but being a tyypical boy, I can't ask hi to talk to me,   his sister, about any feelings. Then again. even if I did, I'd have no   idea about what to do if he broke down. That boy's badder than I   thought he was! He always looks so innocent and sweet, but deep   down, he's a real bad-ass! And mama and Poppa think I was the   flighty kid. Sometimes I wonder if I really am happy with what I've   become. I don't dare talk about it to anyone because everyone thinks   I'm perfect. My bosses, my parents, my friends and co-workers. If I try   to talk to Sulanka about these feelings, he just belittles me, so I   really have no one to talk to. I could talk to  mama, sometimes I wish   I did, but then, she expects so much from me, and I'm so sure she'll   scoff at my worries. She treats me as though I was still an   impetuous child, in need of being humoured. I wish I could make   her see me seriously someitmes. So many people are expecting   me to do well, they depend on me to do them proud. I feel like my   grasp on things os slowly slipping away. What am I going to do   when I graduate? Will I ever amount to anything? Will I ever make   mama happy with me and feel as though I have fulfilled her dream? I   miss Poppa. For all his bluster and old fasioned ways, he's a lot   simpler to please than mama. And daddy, dear daddy, he just wants   me to be happy, but them, I feel as though he doesn't know much   about me, and daddy isn't the sort of person I cold expose any deep   feelings to. He's just not that kind of man. So I have to go along, and   try to do the best I can with what I have. It's not an especially hard lot   even though I fret so much. I have a great family who would do   anything for me, I have a home and a brother who now lives with   me. I have aboyfriend who even if he doesn't give me verything I want,   apparently gives me something I need. The future I suppose, will   just have to work itself out. These crazy thoughts and fears in my   head will just have to sort themselves out, maybe in time they will. I   have to try not to go bonkers, but I just feel so overwhelmed   sometimes, like I'll never get a grasp on my future, or I'll never be   truly happy. I think I know on thing for certain now, I can never be truly   happy if I marry Sulanka and I need to try and get away from him if I   can, no matter how hard it may be, and it will be very, very hard.

672,"okay, this is an interesting assignment. what to write about, there is not much to say. I want to go back home because I am not having to much fun here. I miss my friends and want to sleep in my own bed. keeping in touch takes up a lot of time. oh well asdfjkl;asdfjkl;jjjkl;asdfjum, alreight this is wierd. what am I going to talk about for twenty minutes. ?  well, the food here is really getting discusting, the other day I could have sworn there was a finger in the hotdogs. it made me want to puke, man only three minutes have passed. hmmmmmmmmm. I want ot go home. I just got back yesterday also. I only like the freedom here, it sucks not having a car. I went home and it felt really weird to drive. my rroommate is kind of getting on my nerves, she hasnt done anything but she is just getting on my nerves. she never cleans up and is always on the stupid computer. it just gets on my nerves. like today, she threw away a milk carton in the trash, well if I hadnt have taken the trash down the hall it would have started to smell. also, I'm the only one who brought any functional things. I brought the tv, vcr, answering machine, stereo, vacuum, curtains, rug, etc. she just brought a bunch of junk to clutter everything up and put on my tv. I guess I should stop complaining, but it is really starting to bother me. I might start sounding selfish also, but she doesn't share much and I of course have to let her use my stereo and tv. I also am the only one that really cleans,  this is just bothering me. ot has only been eight minutes. abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz I have never done the alphabet on the keybourd before. abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz how fun:) well, this day sucks. I'm still tired and I just took a two hour nap. I only have one class today and its from 8-9:30 so I have the rest of the day. I really need to do my math homework, I can't stand the professor. he is not very good at teaching. ahhhhhhhhhhhh I'm so anoyed. I feel like I am writing  a letter. okay, when is this instant messenger thing going to finish downloading. its taking forever, I only want to talk to my friends online. no one is ever really on thoukgh so it doesn't really matter. man, I should have brought my discman. I am never going to catch up on the readings I am supposed to do for english and biology. I missed last friday's bio class because my stupid alarm didnt go off. I had set the clock wrong so it said pm instead of am. I felt so dumb, so now I have a buinch of notes to catch up on. !@#$%^&*() HDJHHFGHLKJHSDjljkLKJHFHFHFNVJDUEKASKJDHFUKTHJLKASJHDHFHFH only seven more minutes??????    okay, I still have bio to read, english to print out, and I still have to finish the survey online for this class. maybe if I type slower the time will go bye more quickly. alright, I can't wait till this weekend because I will have more free time, I really need to meet more people. this is not really helping. :) :(:) :( :) :9:0 messed up  -------+++++++++++++============= I wonder if you can draw pictures  ==  ==        *  -------------   @ its a face sticking its tonge out, how cute ",1
2275,"I'm thinking I don't know what I'm thinking. its like my mind is still working although I don't know what to write. I wonder how the keyboard  came into invention and why the letters on the board are the way they are. my history class will be more difficult than I anticipated, my instructor really seems to know what he is talking about. I wonder if he's married, I think if he is married he probably has a very attractive wife. I knew a guy at my high school like that, he was sort of feminine but attractive girls were attracted to him, I never understood it. he was friends with the craziest people. terrill had a death wish. he never understood the value of life or he understood it completely and wanted to live it at the very edge. I wonder why the timer isn't working. I thought a timer was counting down when Pennebaker did this site as an example in class. I'll just stop the timer when 20 minutes have elapsed and count it myself since this fucking site is obviously not working. I hate computers. I hate computing. computing is going to be a bad class that I am not looking forward too. UT is a beautiful campus. I like the way all the sidewalks are shady and all the buildings are very rustic looking. I want to get a bike so I can ride to psychology quickly on Mondays because its a pain in the ass walking all the way there and all the way back with nothing to go to before or after. I'm worried about kaitlin. I think she will be fine and not get hurt or killed but I think war might change her in some way. she says she is ready to die for her country but she still has doubts about the validity of the war which could wear down on her morale as she is in a foreign place with strangers. I hope she can find something over there to keep her interest or just keep her going. Iraqi sandspiders are the scariest fucking things I've ever seen in my life. if a sandspider attacked me I would probably try to kill it and then be traumatized for the rest of my life. rishi is making a weird ass noise. like breathing when you are lifting weights or something. brian is my best friend and he almost died. it is very scary to think that someone my age and so close in all aspects of life to me can die. I am 18 and invincible or so I thought. this must change the entire way he views life. don't treat it as something to take for granted. it is definitely a gift and some people just don't understand that. they either die young or never appreciate what they have which is almost worse. I need to get a rug our room is dirty. I'm looking around to spur my thoughts when something goes on for too long. I like the way the window faces north. I can see almost the whole campus and its pretty in the morning. I want to buy a hang glider really really bad. what is my fascination with flight, it must be something deep in my past or the fact that my dad was a pilot I don't know. I hope I didn't choose the wrong career path with the one I have chosen not really offering me much of a chance to fly unless I become moderately rich. I hate that the common man cannot fly his own vessel, even though the commercialization of flight is just about the coolest thing ever. I wonder what sort of experience it takes to becomes someone who works at the airport. that might be a fun job. maybe even just working in the fucking coffee shop would be cool because you get to meet lots of people from all over the world. Austin is a cool city. I think if my job permits me, I would like to stay here for a good portion of my life. I also want to live outside the US for a while. in a country that has ancient cultural significance. maybe Greece or France or Italy. that would be the shit. I feel like stretching. my back always needs to be stretched after I wake up. I wonder why that is. ok so the timer should have reached 20 minutes by now so I will hit submit. ",0
929,"OK, it's 8:10 and I hope I can get through this assignment without my computer crashing. I hate typing. chris is an asshole; this was a very bad day and I know it's probably bad to always be negative, but I don't fucking care because this is my stream and no one else's and I don't think anyone will read this anyway and if you do, you'll never know who I am because there are ten million people in that fucking class and no one knows who I am. by they way, would it be fucking possible to go to one of those classes and not be surrounded by sorority bitches? I mean, they are so annoying with their chatter about boys and hair and beer and parties, and they talk in class which is really annoying and they make my skin crawl. well I stopped for like 10 seconds, is that OK? are you going to come over here and kill me now? didn't think so. damn, I am displaying some fucked-up-ness am I not? I knew this was going to be a 301 intro class but I forgot that meant freshmen crawling around everywhere. I was never that stupid. I was never that annoying. well fuck, it's only 8:16; but anyway I have a ton of homework to do today and a friend is coming over  for dessert later, so I need to get this done. i will add some happy thoughts just so you don't apply your analytical theories and conclude that I am mad and need to be injected with some medicines to make me happier and more docile. happy. happy. happy. nothing comes to mind. except that donny's trial is finally over and that makes me happy. my brother, donny, was accused be a couple of girls of molestation during a clarinet lesson and that was nine months ago and my family had to pay thousands of dollars to defend the lucky guy and now we have no money, but at least those mini-whores backed down, yeah thanks, after 9 damn months they were like (my hand hurts) nevermind, we don't want to testify (because we're lieing!!!!) how do you spelll lieing? liing, lying yeah lying, sorry that I don't know how to spell but who cares becasue no one is going to read this anyway. I am a very fast typist so I think that my writing will be longer than most chris just walked by sophie the kitty is playing with the lizards and chris is trying to look at the screen but I think he shouldn't his is my fiance and my fhands hurt carpal tunnel carpal tunnel I have a huge secret: I have a giant crush on an old english teacher of mine; she is a woman; and I an engaged to marry a man. hahahahah. that's funny.

I got a 1260 on my SAT and I hapve a 3. 97 GPA; os that was not a very good predictor of my progress at 8:30 see  you. ",1
1591,"   Well for some reason I am stressing out about everything that is going on in the first few weeks of school! Not only are classes overwhelming and so much different than high school because of number of students in each class, but I am in a whole new city! For the first time I am away from my family trying to make my own choices, doing my own laundry, making my own food, and trying to make new friends. I am scared about being able to study too! And I am scared about failing. I also just went through Rush and I am in a sorority which is also very overwhelming. We just had a meeting and we have to keep a certain GPA, finish many hours of volunteer work and stay at the house for at least 10 hours a week to study there. We also have mixers twice a week at night. I don't know how I ma going to manage all of these things at once. I am also stressing about finding where to live next year. I had a deposit down for an apartment with a girl I met during the summer, but the more I got to know her, the more I knew I couldnt live with her. So now I am trying to find a group of nice girls and find a place to live before they are all taken. Not to mention my ex boyfriend is here and things between us are very complicated. I wish he could communicate with me and tell me how he really feels because I am tired of playing all these stupid games! We keep trying to make each other jealous, but I really care about him alot. OHHH and I am getting sooooooo fat! I swear our older sorority sisters want to keep giving us cookies, cake, and candy to make us fatter! I don't have time to excercise. But I really love it here and I know I am going to have so much fun! I have already met several awesome girls that are so fun to hang out with. And since I came from a small baptist schoool its interesting to meet so many different kinds of people. I love how UT is so diverse. I love my roommate too. I went pot luck and was kind of nervous about that but we are perfectly matched. We are both neat freaks and have the same personality. I hope we become great friends, so far we have talked about everything. She is really smart too. I miss my best friends from high school. Two of them went to Baylor, I was baout to go there with them but I loved UT. It was a hard choice to make though. The only person I really knew here were a few older girls that went to my high school and my ex boyfriend. . who is frustrating me! I couldnt sleep at all last night because I was upset with him! I miss my mom and my family too. Even my dog. I don't know when I will go home. . it seems like there is so much to do here. OHH I really want to see the movie Swim fan and Sweet Home Alabama. I bet I won't have time to see movies here and I don't have the money either! My money is all gone! I have no clue where it went, I never get to go shopping here. I also need to find a church to go to, just to keep me grounded. Its kind of hard to focus here. But I am really happy about the sorority I am in. It was such an emotionally draining process, so many girls where heartbroken. But I just hope that there isnt a stereotype against sororities because each girl I have met has been truly kind and helpful and its such a great way to meet people and do stuff for the community too. I am going to the childrens hospital tommorrow morning to visit the children there. I am really excited about that. I love kids. I think I want to be a teacher, I just hope I have the patience for it and that I make it through college! Its so weird to think I am in college right now trying to get a degree! I still feel like a little kid sometimes. Hopefully I will be able to focus and get settled down and figue out my priorities! ",0
309,"Well, I'm in my boyfriend's room typing this. I'm pretty sleepy too, I'm in  Longhorn band, so I had practice last night until about 8:30. Then I went  to a freshman meeting and decided to run for freshman representative. Believe  it or not, I actually won. It surprised me a lot because I don't know anyone. I've met lots of people, but I don't really have any good friends there. It makes  me really happy. I feel like I can now establish myself there and be a  leader in LHB. This assignment is pretty weird because I really do write like this in my spare time. Whenever I get stressed, I usually grab a notebook and just write  everything that comes to mind. This is different though, it's a little harder to type your feelings. It somehow loses some emotion or something. There's really not much stress in my life right now, except the usual  going to college stuff, but I'll write about that later. My French horn teacher was really mean to me on Wednesday. He's this  little old man that looks kind of like Yoda. He always wears bolo ties and well, he's just a little jerk. He enjoys watching his students cry and have emotional breakdowns. We'll see!  I've never let him see me cry and I never will. I think he sees me as a challenge. I mean, he's really talented and of coarse I have lots of respect for him. I just don't  understand why he enjoys hurting people so much. There is a picture of my boyfriend and me on the wall. I like it. (I actually look decent in it) I always look ugly in pictures. I have this  friend that always comes out pretty in pictures. I'm jealous. Well, I've surpassed my 20 minutes, so I better go. ",0
591,"I miss so many things back home. I never thought I would miss anything. But I guess it's true what they say. You never know what you have until it's gone. The transition from high school is not that bad. The schooling is not the part that worries me. It's the living on my own that really worries me. I have always depended on others for my needs and now it is up to me to do it on my own. It does have it's advantages but it also has numerous disadvantages. I wonder what my girlfriend is doing back home at this very moment?  Maybe I should call and see if she is as lonely as I am. I wonder what everybody else is going to write on this same assignment. I hope I can make all A's in my classes this year. I have made straight A's forever and now I guess my parents kind of expect me to keep doing the same thing. I don't want to disappoint them in anyway. College is a very structured society. Everybody hangs pretty much with their own cliches. Like all the Frats and Sororities. Then you have the want to be frats and sororities. Then there's the people who don't care who their surrounded by. I wonder how and where I would be classified. I love this assignment. The thoughts just flow through my head like crazy and now I finally get to write them all down. Too bad nobody will probably ever read it. The mind is a very miraculous thing. I wonder how it works. And why we only use so little of it if it's so big. I wish I could go home right now to visit my friends and especially my girlfriend. I even miss my family. I never thought I would miss them. Just because I was always with them and before I left we had a lot of hard times. But when I left, seeing my mother and father cry was the thing that tore me up inside. I had never seen my father cry. I really hate good-byes. Why do we always have to part from the ones we love. No matter how hard we try, there must always be good-byes. I miss all my high school friends. I wonder how everybody is doing. I wonder if we'll have a ten year reunion. I would really like to know how they are doing in ten Years. I really haven't been able to keep in touch with too many of them. Some went to the Army, others to the Navy, and others to school in various places. My girlfriend is so beautiful. I really hope she is doing all right. I really care for her and she is constantly running through my mind as you can probably see. She just means so much to me and I worry about her all the time. Well, I think I have done enough thinking for right now, I will leave you now to go call her and see how she's doing. . . ",1
1845,"     coming to ut has been a pretty crazy experience. my first week here i already felt like i was at home. it wasnt that way at the college i attended previously. that place took my two years to get comfortable. i think it has something to do with the fact that i have grown friendlier to most people. the one exception is my roommate drew. i don't know why we arent best friends, but i think it has a lot to do wiht the fact that we come from two entirely distinct backgrounds. he was the son of a cop, whos prents got divorced, and i was the son of a librarian, who parents always talked about getting divorced. also, here women seem to enjoy my preasance more, i think that has a lot to do with my radical overhaul of my diet and exercise routine. one girl in particular is named vanessa. she is an entirely charming girl, with a body to die for, but i don't know.  how do we trully know we found the right one, is it that divine spark that fills our soul thew first time we lay eyes on a person or is it a familiarity that stems from shared time with someone that eventually turns to amore?  unfortunantly i was cursed with finding love at frist sight with my fist girl friend. but being as young as we were, i cnat help but think what would hve happened if we would have met later. on this subject i have often wondered about my parents, i have a vague notion that theirs was a marraige of convience. i overheard one day that the last time they had sex was the night i was concieved?!?!!??! i don't now what that means, just came up. this i think is the point of life. the wondering, lust filled age we are in now, followed by silent impotent contemplation. no wonder why all people in power are old and white. they don't have the drive in their hearts to find romantic ideals the way youth does. in a sense i think i am an idealist. i like to see the glass as half full, but usually only with people i care about. this deals alot with social conciense. what a terrible thing to have. all of us who are educated are confronted evertday with the absurdities of our goals. i want to have a nice house and car for my family and i want to help the world. but would i accept lesser for those i love to compensate those i do not know?!?!?!  off course not, yet high minded individuals lambast me when they are doing the exact smae thing. so in the end what does one do, pursue their own intersts or bang ones head against the system. i think it has to be a mixure of the two. because the more one knows, the more one knows that nothing in this world is blakc and white. tragis heroes are made from this assumption. we see how they are commended for making the right choice and getting awarded for it. but seldom do we see all the others who struggle to make the moraly right choice and are punished incesantly. growing up poor i saw this all around me,  many of the poeple i know cannot afford to make the right descision. i myself have chosen to get a college eduction rather than have medical insurance. really in the last 10 years i have done a lot rather than have medical insurance, namely eating, having clothes, and living life. all this ties into the idea that there are not racial barriers anymore, but class barriers that are divided by check books. thats not to sya that the overwhelming majority of poor are not minority, but only looking at color doesnt diagnose the true problem,  money.

902,"Why in the world am I doing this at one thirty in the morning?  On a weekend?  I hope teri doesn't get back until Tuesday, I can't wait to switch rooms. It's funny that she complained about me too. I haven't figured that one out yet. radio stations come in better at this time of day. I kinda wish I was able to go home, I don't like being on a deserted campus. mark is getting annoying. not really. I just don't know what to tell him because I've never been in his situation before. and it's frusterating to have him ask me for advice, and not have any to give him. I love him to death, and it hurts that he's upset and I can't do anything about it. he reminds me of daddy, that's probably why we get along so well. rachel is not the person I thought she was. I can't believe that we were all friends not 3 months ago. I guess I should have noticed, she did the same thing to zack and thomas. I don't understand how someone so smart can be so wild. those two traits don't usually go together. I wonder if alison is having fun at the lake. she's lucky to have her family live so closely. why does this campus insist of having concert by people who are so outdated?  why can't creed come or some band like that? this isn't as hard as I thought it was going to be. I feel guilty about going not going to church. listening to this tape shouldn't be a substitituion for actually going. I think that's what scared teri so much, all the Bibles on my desk. Oh well. Something tells me that my non Christian friends are rubbing off on me more than my Christian ones. I'm hungry, but I don't want any of the pizza that's in the frig. I want to go to pappadeux's. i wonder if a bus runs out there. frog legs would be great right now. my head is starting to hurt. Hamlet was pretty good, I wish I would've read it in high school. gosh I miss thlp. I wonder how much better I would have liked school if it had been just like that. stephen hasn't gotten in touch, I wonder what's up with that. I hope he finds his basketball skills again, it'd be a shame to waste them. he needs to take a break he does too much stuff. this buddy list thing is going to kill me. I shouldn't have it up when I'm doing homework, it's too much of a distraction. I wonder if I have any oreos. ",0
888,"Just got back from the store, its 10:30pm Sunday and I have a ton of home work. My EE321 lab is due this week, but the lab was closed today. makes me mad. No notice or anything, just *poof* and its closed. I studied witha  friend for my other EE class. The stuff is easy but time consuming. I'm worried about my grade in there. Not so much in that I think I'm stupid, but that the Prof's tests are killer. I know this from *many* EE grads who have had him in the past. He's also known for being very hard on students in his office hours. something I'm not pleased with. I'd like to talk to him about the class without worring about him ripping me a new asshole just because I don't have the practical experiance in circuit theory he has. After all, I'm just a junior. School eats up most of my thinking. THere is always a deadline or a test or a lab (or a writting assignment) that is due. it always keeps me jumpy. Allison (my wife) is doing her laundry. on our porch. The washing machine is in our storage closet out there. I'm so glad we're moving. This place sucks. I don't like the way the managment was replaced. and how the new people will lie to the tennants. One building has termites, another gets broken into a lot. The managment will not address these issues, and will act surprised each time you tell them about it. like they didn't already know. All I know is that I have to stay late tomorrow on campus because I have to finish my lab, I might be on campus till 10pm tomorow for all I know. Lab does close at 10:45pm. so I couldn't stay any later than that. I hate lab. Its like they make it as hard as possible to get anything meaningfull done. Most of the equipment doesn't work, and what does work is being used by someone else. the work itself is never that hard, its just getting past all the setbacks (like bad chips, cables, caps, proto-boards, etc. ). And the hours for the weekend SUCK. ony open about 5 hours sat, and NONE Sunday. I hate it. ",1
2249,"I just got back from the University Democrats meeting. It was really fun and informative. Lloyd Doggett was the guest speaker. He was very eloquent and well-versed, and he did an excellent job stating what he stood for and how the current gerrymandering is unfair, but we're not going to let it stop the party from victory. I hope to get really involved with it. It seems like a great way to get to know people and learn a lot about the political system at the same time. Other than University Democrat, I'm going to try to join UBC, Undergraduate Business Council. You have to fill out an application to become an At-Large member. The questions appeal to the creative side in applicant, so I hope that my creativity steps up to the plate. I think that UBC would also be a great way to meet people, especially since it's for students in the Business school. I also want to join Student Government. I think that some of the causes that they fight for are so worthwhile, like trying to extend the hours of the library. Student Council in High School didn't really accomplish that much, but I think that Student Government actually gets things done here. I'm listening to the Shins right now, they're a really good band. I love the melodies and guitar. Other bands that I like include Bright Eyes, Death Cab for Cutie, The Sounds, Belle and Sebastian, The Strokes, and so much more. Basically anyone on Saddle Creek records tends to be really good because they all sound so different. I haven't really been able to find out about new music lately though because I've been sort of busy. I'm taking 14 hours, and my classes are Statistics, Latin 506, Psych, and Microeconomics. They're all pretty good so far, all my professors are pretty nice. I've had a lot of reading to do, and I've been pretty much doing my best to do it all. I'm waiting for a couple of books to come in. I'm waiting for my Microeconomics book and a Latin book to come in. I really wanted to take Intro to Political Philosophy instead of Latin, but oh well. I'm thinking about doing International Business, and Latin is the basis of all the Romance languages, so I hope it will help me with other languages. International Business seems to be like an interesting major, but I still don't know what I want to do. I'm probably doing Pre-Med as well, and I also want to take some RTF classes. I don't think that you can take RTF classes without majoring in it though, so I'm going to have to apply to that college, I guess. I hope I figure out what I want to do because International Business, Pre-med, and RTF are pretty hard to do all together, and I don't want to take longer than four years to finish all that. I honestly don't know what I want to do, I want to do something worthwhile, something different, something exciting, something that's definitely not your average 8 to 5 job, something that truly helps people. I only hope that someday I will realize what I want to do. Although in life, everyone wants something more, no matter what people have, they usually want something more. I hope that whatever happens, I am content with what I have. Man, this Shins song, ""Saint Simon"" is so good. They're coming to Austin soon, I can't wait to see them. Bright Eyes is also coming soon, in October. That is going to be such a good show, it's been like two years since I've seen them live. I think that I can do those three things in four years though, if I take summer school, I think. I came in with 36 hours of credit, so I really hope that it's possible. I need to talk to my advisor about that. He's really nice, his name is Lovelys. He's also my FIG mentor, I am in the Business of Non-Profits FIG. I've always been really interested in Non-Profit Businesses and how they run. Maybe I'll work for a Non-Profit Business. We're supposed to get guest speakers, and we're doing a Community Service project, so that will be cool. Well, my time's almost up, so I'll end here. Ciao. ",1
1216,"This computer lab, Jester East, is rather warm. It's stuffy in here. That isn't however a bad thing, considering how sick I am. Actually, I'm feeling a whole lot better now, as opposed to this morning. I wonder if I missed out on anything important in Linguistics. I doubt I missed out on much. Oh well. I'm relieved about the calculator issue regarding chemistry. I'm glad I know someone who has a car (means of transportation other than the bus). If I keep shopping I may soon find myself in need of help from my parents, financially. Then again, I am buying necessities: food, soap, water, DayQuill, NightQuill, etc. My nose is cleared up. That's something to be happy about. Ah. I can't help but smile at the fact that he came over and simply spent time with me today. He basically just watched me sleep, sniffle, and cough. He's so sweet. I kind of don't want to go home this weekend because of him. He's gone out of town the last two weekends, and now I'm going out of town. Hmm. I don't leave until Friday night. I guess I should try to get a hold of my parents. They may be interested in my visit. Shoot! Only twelve minutes have passed. I feel like I've been typing for a much longer time period. Uhoh, my nose is causing me to sniffle. Ugh. it's so annoying. Good thing I brought Kleenex with me. My mouth is dry. And my tongue hurts from chewing gum. I'm not use to chewing gum, at least not as much as I have been lately. I'm self conscious about my breath, since I have a sore throat. As a result I'm constantly chewing on cinnamon flavored gum. In a way, this isn't exactly my train of thought, at least not the uninterrupted form. I find myself with the need to explain, or give a bit of background info to the reader, if there even is indeed a reader. Ah well. Just three more minutes to go. I can't wait to get back up to my cold room, pop open a can of ginger ale and chug. I've successfully made mouth feel even more dry. My throat is starting to hurt again, but only when I swallow. One more minute left. Perhaps I'll just type my abc's while I wait for that one minute to pass. Ooh. well aren't I little miss creative. Okay time's officially up!. ",1
552,"I know that I have assignments to take care of but I do not want to complete them. I know it is incredibly important for me to perform these tasks. they can make or break my future. yet, I still never seem to be able to motivate myself. it is really frustrating sometimes. But that  is were the apathy sets in again and I will not take action. It seems like a cycle that I know at my house. My dad had behavior problems, to put them modestly, I could see how it would pain him, he did want to change, but it was as if he never followed through. I do not blame  him, I just see a pattern that is similar to mine. But at least I am working now. I still have German 506 to complete that is were I am most suffering. I need to review, and starting to catch up before I wind up failing. It would b e the realization of possibly my worst nightmare. Me being my only downfall, or rather me causing my own downfall. At some point I have to break this cycle but sometimes I don't think I will. But I must press on. If I don't turn it around, on my own now that I am in college, I am afraid I never will , and all the jokes about the weeding out process catching me will actually materialize. I have to start putting my foot down. Tonight was a good start. I told my suite mate who I am very good friends with that I could not go see a band play with him. instead I opted to stay home and do work. However, only now I am beginning to work on it. That is very disappointing . It seems as if it will be another late night, another example of destructive behavior. I will go home this weekend and perhaps seeing all my old friends and especially my parents will provide both some moments of relaxation and clarity for realizing the importance of my task at hand. It will be very nice to get away. The depravity of this city seems to be catching me. Or rather I am slowing down to let it get me. Waco is a much different society than Austin. I cannot be lure d away. Then again that is a mistake for me to blame this city. Waco has all the same trappings, I just had a strict support system to keep me from falling . Now I can fall and It doesn't look that I will stop. I cannot think like that. But any rate, it will be nice to see the old friends and parents and perhaps be able to better take in my first 3 weeks of college and that way tell what all indeed I need to work ion to improve myself. I just know that this cannot go on or I will star5 to pay some very hefty consequences. My dad always told me before I left for UT that I would be greatly affected t by the people I surround myself with. I can see how this is partly true but I do not think they will control my pattern of thinking or my priorities. I will start breaking from their carelessness now and develop my own work habits. I will be in control of what it is I will do on any given evening instead of bowing to my lethargy and trying to relay on some mythical easy way out to appear. This is the time for me to start caring. I am not sure what else I can talk about. I have run the gamut with those previous thoughts and to talk of them more would just seem to be beating a dead horse. My mind is almost weary from thinking about the subject and I need an escape. Perhaps it is the midnight hour approaching that is getting to me. I don't believe that I have  much longer to continue writing on this assignment. Two very large priorities for the even9ihng that I still have to take care of is my German, which I have already stressed the importance of, but also washing clothes because tomorrow I return to work and I need better clothing than what I am wearing, or have been wearing for the past two days. It may seem late, but if I am outrunning that new leaf, I am going to have to start somewhere, and if not now, when. My mind is growing blank and I believe that I should rest before going on to the next assignment so as not to be staring for thoughts on the next topic. ",0
87,"Okay, I just started writing or well I guess typing. I am still kind of emotionless because I just woke up. You know how when you first wake up and you just need to go to the bathroom but after that you don't know what to do. I'm not hungry or thirsty or anything. I am kind of cold though, because the fan is right over my head. I have a pretty good feeling because I got to this page alot easier than I thought I would. Right now the only thing I really think about is a situation I am in. I am dating this guy and he's really great, but he keeps asking where our relationship is going and I don't really know. The big problem is that this guy I dated off and on for over a year is about to be transferred (he's in the Army) to Kaline which is pretty close to here and he calls and writes but never asks if I am seeing anyone new. I don't know if this is because he doesn't care and just wants to be friends or if he just assumes that I am waiting for him. Knowing him he will probably expect me to drop anyone I happen to be involved with as soon as he moves down here. This is something I normally would not mind doing, but I really like this guy I am dating so I don't know what to do. My bathroom is making the weirdest noise right now. I probably need to have that checked out. I am having to shift positions right now because I am not very comfortable and my neck is starting to hurt. Now my nose itches so I have to rub it. My room is a huge mess because they just set up my computer and won't let me throw away any of the boxes so they are piled up in my room until I have the chance to take them home. My hands are starting to shake a little so I must be getting hungry. My roommate should be getting back from class pretty soon and maybe she will make me something to eat. I kind of don't like it when she is in the kitchen though because she tends to make a pretty large mess and it tends to take her a few days to clean it up. You can't really say anything to her because she gets real defensive and it starts a fight. I really miss my cat, Black Jack, I have had her since I was two and she is BEAUTIFUL!!!  I think my twenty minutes are about up and I am really hungry, so I'm going to end this. BYE!!   ",1
690,"When I was young, I always like to lied. I remember one day I lied to my mother that I went to library to study. But instead, I went to the nearest video game center to play arcade. When come back from home, I told my mother that I study very hard in the library. After I said that,  my grandmother smile at me for a moment which last for about few seconds. At that time, somehow I got strange feeling that something is wrong, but I am not very sure about that. I kept thinking about the wicked smile that my grandmother gave it to me within that two or three seconds. Then I decided to analyse this situation carefully. First, when I lied to mother at that moment, did I carelessly  show any sign of unordinany behavior, like shaking my body or showing a very dishonest face without I knowing it. Second, did I say something wrong or stupid, that have indirectly showed me I am lying at that moment. Third,  did my clothes have any cigarette smell?  Or did some of the people saw me enter the video game center and tell the incident to my mother?  Or is it my grandmother just want to smile and being nice to me, and I am the one who is too sensitive about the smiling incident?  Even though I made many hypothesis, but I still could not figure if something is really wrong. I am kind of nervous and just keeping thing that incident. After dinner, my mother asked me why does it take me so long to finish my study, and I told her I have a lots of homework to do. Then she said I was lying because my sister had followed me and seen me enter the video game store. At last, this incident had ended, and it also prove me that my six sense is correct. ",1
1641,"Man, i have to do this writing assignment. what a waste of time. i could be sleeping right now. i am so tired. stupid 8:00 classes. i don't want to go to class anymore. that door is really loud. i wonder if the cleaning woman is done cleaning the bathroom. i really have to go. oh well, i can wait 20 minutes. i wonder why 20 minutes is so relative to this assignment. sigh. i can't think of anything to type. pretty blank right now. what's on tv. looks like some big guy doing a hefty exercise. OH MY GOD!  that guy's huge!  picking up kegs. that's strength, right there. i wish is was that strong. that would be really cool. too bad it takes forever to develop that. results would be nice. all that working out at the gym. that's a nice looking road. oh, union pacific. oh, lindsay's responding to my aim. she fell asleep. figures. she's always tired. why am i so bitter about this breakup. i mean we said we were going to be friends. if we're friends then why do i find myself mad at her all the time. i think she doesn't like being around me anymore, despite what she says. girls are so complicating. she could at least be up front about it if she didn't want to hang out anymore. i think this whole ordeal is destroying our chances of getting back together. whatever. i miss her though. or is it her that i really miss?  maybe i just miss having a girlfriend. someone to hold and appreciate. i wonder if. what are you talking about josh. whatever. where was i. oh yeah, girlfriends. world's strongest man. raise your hand, you kow it. raise your hand. damn, this tv's too loud. i can't think. raise your hand. 100 percent. if you're sure. chicken tenders. kick out of dinner tonight. tonight on sports center. what makes realationships so complicated. i see my other friends who are couples and they appear to be fine. steven and katy look like they'rein love with each other. that'll never last. steven't shouldn't be treated like that. and katy needs someone more independent, not a luzy hobo. whatever. at least they have a relationship. man, jeff's got it good. he just picks up girls so easily. people like to be around him. plus he's got erin back home he can go back to for some loving. i miss loving. those were some good days. that's prob why things never worked out with lindsay. she prob wanted something more in the relationship. but what?  i always took her out on dates. . made her feel special. and i slip up one time on my birthday. damnit. why did i have to act that way. i hate when i do that. but one mistake was all it took for thing to go sour. pennebaker?. yeah that's his name. uh. damnit!  i'm so bitter. i really should cool down if i'm ever going to get back in another relationship. who knows how long that'll be. there's a couple girls in band. my gracious!  they are hot!  that would be some sweet loving there i must say. but then there's the guilt of lindsay. there's a neverending trap. what if she still wants back into the relationship?  i know she told sarah that it's a possibility later on this year, but should i really wait for her?  did she really mean that much to me?  of course she did, or i would've broke up with her a long time ago. but why do i feel differently now?  what makes now so different than the past. i guess things get old over time, and changes must be made. looks like i took the first step by breaking up. i guess i should just move on. we'll see. oh, time's up. oh but i can still write. hmm. well i guess i'm done. i want to sleep before band practice anyway. man, why do we have to go off campus. they make things so difficult.

2380,"     When I think about what I'm thinking, a void pops up. I guess because the brain never really stops, it's hard to pinpoint an exact thought in any moment. I can recall past topics that have rambled through my mind however, so that's what I'll dicuss. A topic that's popluar in my brain is my boyfriend (surprising right?)  I think about how happy I am in our relationship and how much of a good friend and boyfriend he is. He goes to college at Trinity University, which is in my hometown of San Antonio. We see eachother nearly every weekend, so it's not hard to sustain the relationship. Though, I constantly wonder if he really does care about me. He tells me that he does, and I know that he does, but I'm really insecure about that issue. My insecurity on that issue stems from my past relationship where my then boyfriend would tell me that he cared about me, but ended the relationship somewhat abruptly without any sign or signal. That's probably why I worry so much about it. However, I am really happy in my relationship. I have no complaints except for my own lack of security. On another topic, I have my first test this Thursday. I'm a little scared, but I think that I'll be fine. I pretty much know the material, but I still need to go over and over it to get it down. I don't think I'll have a problem with it. At least I hope that I do well. I feel exahsted thinking about all the studying I have to do for my upcoming tests. I have a chemistry test next week. I don't know how to do converstions without a table telling me what every measurement is. But I guess that I'm going to need to memorize that sort of stuff so I do well. It's so imperitive that I do well in college because I have plans to go to medical school after I graduate. I don't know what else I would do with my life if I didn't get into medical school. I have developed some back up plans if you will in case something should happen. I could be a teacher if medical school doesn't work out. The pay isn't that great but the job seems pretty alright. I would enjoy some sort of FBI/CIA type of work also. I need something that's going to make me constantly think. Though I hate studying, as every student does, keeping my mind on the go is something I love. I think that's why I played soccer all my life. Soccer is a game of constant thinking. There is no stopping in soccer. There are no time outs, so you can't stop to regroup. You have to be on your toes and know your stuff to be a good soccer player. I wish I was still playing soccer. I really miss it. I stopped playing after my last high school season a few months back. I feel sort of empty without it. It was such a big part of my life for so long. I think I'm going to attempt to walk on next year to the UT soccer team. It's really hard to do that though. The team is extremely competative. Though, I think after I talk to my coaches back home, maybe they can help. My main concern at the moment is doing well in school. I really need to buckle down and study. I study everyday, but I need to do it more I think. Maybe I'm just stressing about my upcoming tests. I'm scared about my chemistry test. Though, I think with the right amount memorization of some problems along with some other material, that I'll be fine. I need to start preparing for my biology test tomorrow. The test is Thursday, so I have 2 days to get in all the information. I feel tired right now. I wish I had came back to Austin earlier so I would've started on my work earlier. Well, tomorrow's another day, so I guess I'll just do a lot of studying tomorrow. There's no sense in doing it right this second when I'm not feeling to good and when I'm tired. My main priority is studying for my biology test Thursday. I need to go over the old exam she gave to us. My boyfriend just called me, but I had to tell him that I would call him back so I could finish this writing assignment. I really hope I do well on my test Thursday. If I did well, I would be so happy. That would mean that I actually liked my major and that I could retain the information pertaining to it. I want to call my boyfriend back after this, but my roommate ""can't consontrait"" with my talking, so I guess I'll go outside. Though, she's talked many a times with her boyfriend while I was reading. Oh well, maybe I'm a little more respectful. ",1
2084,"I'm not quite sure what to write about, and I highly doubt that anything interesting will come out of this paper! It makes me nervous to turn in a paper that I won't have time to proofread or check over. One of my English teachers used to take off points exponentially for every grammar error in the paper! Luckily my teachers aren't like that and this is the first paper I've had to write so far. Which is a good thing, I'm definitely not complaining. It is also the first actual homework assignment I have had, the rest is just reading and reading and more reading! Luckily most of it is interesting. I know in high school they said that college would be much harder and that there is more homework, but I don't think so. It isn't harder because there is more time to accomplish things in. the. Besides, teachers aren't so anal here. Maybe it's just UT, but I love it! I love the liberal attitude! Anyway, my roommate is due back at any second. Everytime I hear doors slam or flip flops coming this way, I think it is her. It's a bit distracting, although I guess in a way I already am distracted. I just don't know what to write about! I really hope this paper isn't graded on content! But Rachel, my roommate, is really nice. She thinks she is a witch, which I thought was incredibly weird, but whatever. I haven't seen anything weird since I've been here. Unless one considers a tarot reading weird that is. She did a reading on the phone to her boyfriend of three weeks that she has never met! Isn't that weird? I can't imagine that relationship going anywhere. But it makes me feel glad that I have Michael. He is been my boyfriend for two years, and now that we are in different cities, it's hard! I think he is taking it harder than I am, but I don't know how to help him! I guess that if the situation was reversed, I would be freaking out too. It's just that I have so many things to do here, that I can't talk to him every single time he wants to. Maybe things will improve with time. I finally found the lyrics to Enya's song called ?Only Time. ? It really has a great message, although almost all of her songs do. As the title implies, she talks about how only time knows everything. Time knows if you will stay married or if your troubles will go away. Knowing that is great, it's just hard. Kind of like the saying ?easier said than done. ? It's hard waiting for things! Not material things necessarily, but for success and happiness and similar things. I guess that's what everyone wants; happiness. I'm scared that I won't find it in my future work. Even though I love helping people and I know Social Work is a great thing, social workers make less than $30,000 a year! It makes me wonder if I have some greater purpose in life. So many things interest me that I feel pressured in choosing what to follow through with. A friend of mine has the same problem and she said ?I feel like I have 10 souls inside of me and each wants to do a different thing. ? And I feel the same way! Ideally I just want to make a difference and help people. I'm sure that somewhere in the next four years I will figure out what I want to do. It makes me wonder how other people just automatically know what they want to do. Is it because they are really good at something and want to follow through with it, or is it just because they made a random decision and want to stick with it? Who knows! I have nothing to do all night which is the perfect chance to study, but for some reason I just can't concentrate. Maybe it's because I took a nap and now all I want to do is go back to sleep! For the first few weeks I was sleeping wonderfully, but I haven't been able to for the past few days. Maybe Pennebaker's talk about college kids having sleep problems affected me! I doubt it though. But it is great being in Psychology. Although the book can be a bit boring sometimes, some of the subjects are incredibly fascinating and I can relate to most of them! Michael laughs at me all the time because I am constantly trying to justify things in life by what I learn in psychology. He has a terrible memory, so when I learned about the hippocampus or the amygdala or whichever it was, I immediately thought of him. And of course he laughed at me and thought I was silly to think that he had a medical deficiency since he couldn't remember things well. Oh well I guess! At least he loves me! Well, I have one more minute and I don't know what I'm supposed to close this off with, but I guess that means I'm supposed to keep rambling on. I would be really interested in seeing what kind of study these are being used for, if any. I would love to see what people wrote about. Probably friends and school, which seems to be what mine is dominated by, but maybe not! ",1
2464,"It is Wednesday, December 8th and a lot has been going on this semester. I am trying to finish the semester out as strong as possible but it has not gone the way it was expected to go. although the overall grades that will be received is not that overall impressive, I know the work that was put into this semester was the most put into to school since high school. the only class that was a disappoint meant so far was my psy class. with two test left, there was still a chance to make an A or B in the class which was expected. it turns out after bad test four results when everything felt as if the test went well, the goal of the class shifted from trying to get an A or B to get simply trying to get a C and pass. granted that the most stress of the semester fell during the week of test three due to all the health issues and having like 10 different assignments and three test, it was still a disappointing outcome but focus can only be placed on what is left. the last three exam are going to be pretty tough with a chance for me to make to A's and a B's if a perfect score is received on two of the finals and an A on the other. My only focus has been on the two exams on Saturday but it does not feel like there is enough time in the day for every topic to be covered. all that can be done is to prepare as much as possible and pray that everything turns out right. doing well in school this semester would relieve the large amount of pressure that is a result of me not being concerned with school over family issues. It seems as though just when I try to get on track a new unthinkable obstacle just shows up. this semester the fact that I was taken advantage of and received and std as a result of doing something I did not want to do in the first place really makes me mad but I still have to be mad at myself for getting myself in that situation. next semester hopefully no random distractions will pop up and my grades will be all a's which is very possible for me to achieve. Making it through this semester is the number one thing in mind right now. all that is left is to push through these exams and finish strong. all I can do is my best the rest is out of my hands. I have to do something to make it easier for my parents. ",0
2014,"I really don't know what to type. I wonder what this keyboard is made of. I really hate it when I type and I have to keep on pressing the backspace. The air conditioning unit is really load in here right now and it's really cold. My neck hurts. What the heck is that on the ceiling. was it there before? I remember in junior high when we all used to chew up paper and make spit-wads to throw at the ceiling and see who could get the most stuck. Is that how you would spell spit-wads? There's so many words that I'm not quite sure how to spell. I remember I used to hate spelling tests in elementary. Wow, I couldn't believe that I sat next to someone today in my Calculus class who was actually in my kindergarten class! I hadn't seen him in forever. I must say it really freaked me out. It was hot today. The walk to the business school killed me. On the one hand I love that I live in Kinsolving. Great food. Nice people. Close to the drag. Plus a whole lot of my classes are near Kinsolving. When did Lisa leave? It must have been around 12. I wonder when she is getting back. I'm excited to go home tomorrow. even if it is just for a few hours. I left so much stuff there! I mean, I would have my mom just send it to me, but if I give her the permission and opportunity to go through my stuff in my room, there's no telling how long she would search, and definitely no telling what she would find. That's not to say that there's anything significant that would get me into any trouble. but I know that there's old notes from junior high. crazy pictures from those crazy party nights. and who knows what all else. Man, that timer thing at the top of this page is making me nervous for some reason. I definitely hate timed tests. Such as the SAT's. For starters I hate the fact that it's a standardized test. Secondly, I hate that it's timed. And above all else I HATE the fact that colleges weigh your application so heavily on your scores. Now I know that it makes sense to do it that way because they need some way to evaluate your intelligence in comparison to all other applicants. However, some people are just not good test takers. ME! In school I can study, understand, and learn material that enables me to do well on my tests and quizzes. But going into a test not knowing exactly what it will ask makes me so intimidated and nervous. See, look at me. When I start talking about tests and intelligence scores I try to make coherent sentences; in other words I try to make myself seem intelligent. Enough of that. What else am I thinking about. I can't believe that I am actually in college. It sounds so clichÃ¯Â¿Â½, but I can remember just yesterday when I was in elementary school. how my biggest concern was who I was going to play with after school. or what time recess was. It was great being a kid. That's not to say that I don't enjoy the freedom that I have now, but with freedom comes tremendous responsibility. I have my mom on my mind and I think that's what made me type that sentence. I just noticed that at the beginning of this writing assignment it was a lot harder to sit and type exactly what I was thinking at that moment. I would think of something and then type it. Now my hands seems to just be flowing, my fingers just seem to be hitting keys. That's weird to me for some reason. Well I only have a couple of minutes left. To me, 20 minutes sounded like a long time to sit and type random thoughts, I figured I wouldn't be able to do it. But here I am. This chair is so uncomfortable. It's so hard and so wooden. At least it's not a big, soft chair because I would never get anything done. I would fall asleep ten minutes after sitting in it and trying to read. Reading. Something that is my downfall. I do love to read, but making sure that I have read certain material and being held accountable for it is a totally different story. Ouch. Something just bit me and I'm a little curious to know what it was. Probably an ant. ,isn't that gross! We have ants in our dorm room! ",1
1123,"Right at this very moment I am feeling very anxious and very stirred up. I am thinking about everything that is due this week and I am very nervous. Not the good kind of nervous that keeps you on your toes, but the kind that makes you want to vomit. I am sitting here typing this paper and not really knowing what I am going to write next. I am kind of stuck right now on what to type, but the assignment calls for us to write exactly what pops into my head while typing, and I guess this is it. I am thinking that I should be someplace right now I think that I may have missed something important all of a sudden. That is really scary. I hate that feeling. I am really tired right now and could really use a nap. I tossed and turned all last night and couldn't fall asleep. I woke up about every hour wondering where I was and if I had overslept and missed my class. Man I need some sleep. I really want to go home now, I am tired of this school already and I haven't even been here a week. I keep telling myself it will get better, it just has to, but I am really not sure of anything at this time. My life has been turned upside down, I have left the comforts of my house to come down here, and apparently I am supposed to be educated. I really don't think that I am going to be too much more educated than I already am. I think that college is just more of a matter of survival than skill. And I am paying plenty of my hard earned money to go here and be tortured like this. Man I wish my parents had enormous amounts of money so I could just come down here like some people and just play and have a good old time, but no I am here and I can't flunk out, because I am not able to drop any courses, or else I will not be considered a full time student. If that isn't stress I don't know what is. Anyways that seems to be my thoughts about the grand University of Texas right now. I have a feeling it might change within the next couple of weeks. It had better, or else I may not make it here. I considered just up and walking out and never coming back. It kind of seems like a bad idea. I am thinking also that I should not be having to write this paper if nobody is going to be grading it. I think it is a waste of my time. But apparently it isn't if it will help my grade. It seems really pointless to me that I have to write this paper for nobody. These walls are really green and who puts green and white carpet to cover walls. Walls are not supposed to be carpeted. I am the only person that is writing a paper right now and I think that I am being really loud. Nobody is saying anything but I know that they are looking over here watching and looking to see what I am doing making all that click click of the keys on the keyboard. Spanish is really going to kick my butt! I do not really comprehend anything and how I don't want to go to that class after I write this paper. I have about four minutes of writing left. What joy it brings me knowing that I am almost done with this assignment. What if I have done the assignment wrong? What if this is one of the papers the graders actually read and they think that it is bad and they give me a big fat F for my grade. ARGGGG! I think I am going to give myself an ulcer by the end of this semester! It seem like all I have on the brain is School school, school. I get to go to the Football game this weekend. Matt is going to come home and I get to see him. I guess that will be some fun. I am glad that I don't live in Stephenville. I need to call him either tonight or tomorrow and see where I am supposed to pick him up at on Friday. There is a picture of a paper clip with a light bulb over its head and it is winking at me. That is really irritating. They really need to take that off of the computer program. Who ever comes up with some of this stuff? I wish I could just sit in an office all day and come up with ideas about different things. I think that would be fun. I really need to spell check this document now. The weekend is almost here. What fun. The paper clip is asking me what I want to do now. A talking paperclip, who would have ever thought. ",1
1609,"       tj just got home and made his coffee. It smells good. I should have made coffee instead of drinking 3 cupsof Earl Gray tea because after two cups I have to pee every 10 to 15 minutes. Is it going to flood again. Looks like it is going to rain more. Ihope the tropical depression doesnt stall causing flooding again. We were sooo close last Nov. Itis about time for a nap. all this reading to do toady. That has to be completed today. My school schedule sucks. My work schedule sucks. Added together = triple sucking. I have NO reading time. I need to settle mom's affairs to that I don't have towork this semester. Rick will help me if the probate isnt over. He is truely manic depressive. His birthday upsetting him so he bought his 57 inch TV and now after the New Orleans deseaster his new Mercedes. Could it be from his Zoloft that he is taking for his premeture ejaculation condition?  If your mental state is fine and you takean anti depressant for a medical condition (non mental), can that cause a mental condition itself?  Was he trueful with me on the ture purpose for taking Zoloft?  Or, is he a scheemer?  The plane flying over triggered my thought that I can't beleive that it has already been a year since that traumatizing pictures on TV of 9-11. I have to pee already but I can't since this is timed. But I need to really badly, now that I thought of it. Dinner. What shall I make?  Should I save my time and just order Pizza?  I hope that my wallet that was stolen in New orleans arrives Monday. I hope that the receipts that I need to return those books are still in it. I am soo thankful that there are still good, honest people left in this world and that one found my wallet. He said that there was no money in it but what other stuff that was in the bill compartment is still there. I need to send that guy something as a thank you for your trouble to send it back to me. What should I send him?  Money for the acutal cost of sending my wallet to me and maybe a gift certificate, but from where?  I was soooo careful, making sure that my back pocket was buttoned at ALL times, almost like an obsession - constantly checking the button. Leson learned though, don't have your , never mind, strangers shouldn't have to read that thought. I hope nothing is wrong with my niece. I hope that she is not upset that I couldn't chat with her while typing this. Only 5 more minutes left. my laundy is ready to be taken out of the dryer. 4 minutes left to keep typing. I may have to restart the dryer to keep my clothes from wrinkeling. Why did I stop ironing all my clothes all the time. But it feels soooo good to not worry about little stuff like that anymore. I am pleased with the present me; although it is a VERY differnt me. Overall, I am pleased with the present. Getting over Moms death is comming along nicely. Still have my mommy moments though. I guess I always will. Im just glad that the urge to call her every sunday, like I have for years, has stopped. That was VERY irritating every sunday not getting to hear her voice. I miss her. But, thats the consiquence of love. Losing them one day. But man, the number of people that I have lost is astonishing. Damn you Reagan!!! so many deaths on your shoulder. ",0
543,"K. , now I'm writing, but I'm actually kind of confused about what to do. I never really had an assignment such as this one. I feel no pressure since its for a completion grade, so I guess I feel some what good right now. I feel excited about school because I finally finished my schedule and its not going to be so bad after all. I guess my hopes are kind of high right now. I was also excited about your class since I nearly did not get in. At first, the class was closed and so I gave up until I peaked on my roommates computer to see that there was an opening in your class, but it closed again right after I added your class. I also feel kind of stressed because I'm looking for a job at the moment to pay all of my bills and my rent this year. On top of all of this I am now taking more hours this semester than I have ever had, so I guess I have my work cut out for me this year. I am also anxious about finishing this assignment now, I feel compelled to look at the clock and check to see if I have now surpass the 20 minute mark or not. Nope, still got quite a bite of time left. So, lets see what else I feel. I also feel somewhat lonely because I had to leave my family and friends at home. Even though I have two roommates, they are kind of kept at a distance. My goal this year is to try to succeed at a job, if hired, get a 4. 0, not party as much, and meet more people. I like meeting people, they are all so different and its funny to see likenesses in some. I found that you can also find people that remind you of others you used to know and you automatically share the same felling of like or dislike for that person because of the reminder. Confusion and hopefulness is what fills most of me at this point. So, I hope that's ok. Part of the confusion I feel is because of this class. I went to the pre-testing section to fill out the form to receive the free hour but the connection was bad or something like that, so now I had to finish assignment one now and do the test afterward if I'm allowed by the computer. Ah, my time is almost up and I'm feeling that sense of accomplishment. Alright now signing off, feeling good, tonytone. ",1

2187,"Crap, I was half way through this assignment and my computer just cut out or something. I really hope it didn't already submit because I don't want to screw up my credit for this paper. Great, now I'm completely paranoid that I've managed to screw up something so simple. I'll keep my fingers crossed. I need all the help I can get to do well in this class. Actually, I haven't worried about my grades in a long time. When tests start, I'll panic. It's really hard to focus in my morning classes during lectures. I never get enough rest. My schedule's all out of order. I can't fall asleep until around two or three and then have to wake up at seven. I'm tired all day long. I hear my TV and want to go watch it. I always put stuff off and watch too much television. I have a problem with procrastinating. I never used to be this bad. I'm scared that since I can't get on a study plan, I'll fail. I hate it when I over use a word when I'm writing. I feel like I haven't written enough, but does length matter?  My birthday is next week, which somewhat depresses me. I'm not close to any of my friends, and I'm scared they're going to forget about me. I feel like the only loser out of my friends who's not having this great college experience. It's not that I'm homesick, just kind of restless and bored. I haven't met that many people and frankly, feel like an outcast. My head hurts, but I have no tylenol. I hate swallowing pills. I used to break them up and put them in yogurt. I'm such a wuss. My roommate went home for the afternoon. I'm glad she is gone. She can be a little much with the extreme cleanliness. I went out of town one weekend, and she made my bed. I don't really want her invading my space and touching my things. ",1
494,"that is what I think about a lot right now. having finished highschool, I was mentally done. I had had enough of intensive studying. I forgot however that  I still had to college. the other thing I also think about a lot is the fact that I wish I was in the east coast studying. I wanted an out of state experience. but unfortunately could not get it. n. e. ways. right now I am also thinking of my first paper. I think it will be easy. but the fact remains that I have to do it. I can do papers once in a while. but if it ends up being every week or even every other week. I am going to have some serious problems. I already am having trouble reading. there is just too much to read and I am used to not having to read. in highschool, if you paid attention in class then you don't need to read. in college. paying attention in class usually doesn't matter. some teachers teach different things. but the crux of the info remains in the book. there will never be enough class time to teach everything in the book . so you have to read in order to teach yourself. I went to Chicago this weekend. the last attempt to extend my vacation as much as I could. now on I keep telling myself that I need to start buckling up. but Chicago was awesome. I met all my friends I met when I went to a camp in D. C. during the summer. it was cool seeing them all again. and making sure we keep in touch. I don't know if we'll keep in touch though. a lot of them live far. Chicago. new York. its hard maintaining friends here at UT let alone 1000 miles away.  UT is pretty fun although. no matter where i8 am I can have fun. its just that I wasn't wanting this as my experience. since I have to take it I will make the most of it, but I know there could be better. plus. Austin is almost like an extension from Houston. and one of my goals was to get away from Houston. to get away from the same people. to get away from a bunch of social crap. the incredible thing is the fact at how awesome some of the girls are. I'm already having fun here. four days into school and I got a lot of fun!! I guess this is different than the type of girls I hung out in Houston. most of them were pretty traditional. here its really easy to get to know some girls who like to play around but are also pretty cool people. not the skanky or ho type. just cool girls who like physical fun. oh well. I'm getting pretty tired of expressing my stream of consciousness. plus I've been typing for about 20 minutes any ways. . so if anyone is really reading this. I'll see you later   ",0
365,"I keep coughing so much in class I think I probably annoy the crap out o everybody there. I should stop smoking so much. It feels good to be back in school, seeing friends again, but I miss my mom. She is wittiog all the way in Ethiopia and I'm over here. IT sucks. But there is always Christmas time, so it is not that bad. I have no idea what that holiday is going to be like. This guy just bumped in to me an did not even apologize. I hate it when people do that. He just walks by like It's okay to knock people into a damn computer screen. Jerk. I don't understand how I am going to keep writing for twenty minutes. The way I type it will probably be the worst thing anyone has ever read. I tend to type fast and then screw up a lot along the way. There is a guy near me talking a bout the Swiss air crash and Jerry McGuire. I hate baseball so I couldn't care less. There goes my cough again. I got to get home soon, I got a date. This is really a nice girl and I hope it works out, but I will probably spend the hold time coughing anyway. The guy is now talking about wire services. What in the world are wire services. I am getting kind of thirsty and I should get a drink of water, but I do not know where the water fountains in this library are. I hate asking people about it, I guess I feel stupid. I wonder what the guys who read this stuff do. Do they analyze it of just laugh at the kind of things people come up with. I would probably laugh a lot. If this was me reading it I would be cracking up. Then a gain I am kind of a jerk. What I don't understated about the internet is how people think its so much phone. I like e mail and research its great. But this whole surfing the web for hours like its some sort of athletic event seems kinds stupid. I thinks I sound like some commercial  I saw. Its amazing how TV effects you like that. You watch some stupid ditcom and then start using the vocab all over the palace. IT hate the people who keep going yadda yadda because of Seinfeld. But then again I pick up enough catch [phrases anyway. I just looked at  the watch, another ten minutes of writing. This is really weird. This is the first psych class I have taken and so far I enjoyed it. This is a different kind of activity. I have difficulty understanding how this helps us learn anything, but then again I am cynical by nature. The prof was talking about the brain today and it was really technical  I thought the class would not be like that. Not that I mind or I did not understand it, it was just a surprise. Somebody once told that psych classes are some of the most fun, I hope he is right. I don't see much of him anymore, he got married and has kids. So his life really changes. He's like my brother, wee used to hang out and drink beer all the time and go to games and stuff like that. Now he only wants to take his baby to the Children's museum and  do family things. I love the kid, but I miss the old him who would drive off to new Orleans on a whim because he wanted a sandwich form a particular cafe. It's funny who people change. I' feel I have changed in college. I would not say I grew up, I just found out things about myself that I would not have ordinarily known like what it's like to be away form all the comforts of home and how I would handle it. Or to be away form Africa and in America again. I kind of glorified it but it did not turn out that way. I hope that December comes so, I am looking forward to all my friends and my parent, an my dog . I want to get a dog hear but the apt does not allow it so I guess I am stuck. My place is too small anyway. I have not really seen that  many apt in Austin that allow pets. but I am sure there a lot. Hey that girl is really cute.

2228,"Here I sit wondering just what to write that involves my stream of consciousness, which shouldn't be too hard. Writing for me is usually pretty easy, however this assignment seems to be particularly hard. Maybe because I feel partially tired and torn down from my long day. I am looking forward to tomorrow because Thursdays are probably my easiest days because I will not have to wake up at the usual 9am and oh yeah it is also one day closer to the weekend!  Although I have to say that 9am is also a lot better than 8am, which was time I had to arrive at school during my high school days. Since high school just popped into my mind, I have to say that college is a major leap from high school. Despite the fact that it is more enjoyable it also is a lot more stressful. For instance, leaving your family, friends, and so forth behind. Not to mention your adolescence. I am happy to say that the transition for me has ran pretty smoothly although the major bumps are yet to come. One of my ""bumps"" that I am experiencing is the massive amount of reading involved, at one point I enjoyed reading but maybe that is because the reading is not usually my preferred choice. Another obstacle is that it it is your choice whether to read or not, in fact it is just another realization that I am out in the real world and everything is based upon my choices. I find that very scary, yet also very exciting in a positive way because I can make my future what I want it to be.  ",1
1503,"Life, was is it. what can we humans get from it. Is it just something we experience and can't explain? but why do I think of this? no one tells me to do it I just to it. do I feel like I have the answers? maybe, maybe we all have the answer to what bothers us. can we decide when the hurting stops and when our happiness begins. I guess I'm trying to evaluate what is bothering me now. kind of strange, or is it? the think that is bothering me now is that someone else is going to read what I am placing down on this sheet. it doesn't seem fare for me to be doing this when no one else tells me what they think. so I'm giving my 2 cents for nothing, and to no one so I will think about something else. school. kind of fun yet very hard to do. what should I major in? I wanted to do something with math but now that kind of seems hard, money wise. I'm guess I'm just going to go for something that is easy for me to get now. then payback loans and go back for a math degree of some type. what to think of now. students in my classes seem strange this year. heck I seem a little strange this year. I've noticed that I have changed about the aspects of what my university has to offer. I can see why most people come to this school for, and guess what, not for the classes. I remember reading one year in a sociology class that the university can act as a marriage broker. I see this statement ""seems"" to be true now. is that why I came to this school, probably. I mean I could of stayed in my home town if I wanted just to go to college. would have been cheaper that way. also family had to do with it as well. older brother went here and got a bs in aerospace engineering. could this also explain my interest in the mathematics? and why do I seem to be self evaluating? should I just go with the flow and not worry about the future, past, or even the present? nah, I like to keep my ideas in sort ""check. "" now I'm remembering what my friend said about the Buddhist religion and one of the guidelines in it. it basically said that if you get rid of desire, you will feel no pain. kind of an interesting statement. because it shows a whole set of values that you could change, and this would make you happy. now thinking of what my evolutionary biology teach once said. purpose of life is to pass your genes onward, sense genes are immortal. these two statements seem to conflict with each other. that funny. now beginning to think about what time it is. 7:18, only 7 more minutes to go for this rant. well, guess I can explain what I plan to do tomorrow. going to cal class and spark up a conversation with a member of the opposite sex. reasoning being is for ""help"" on the homework, just needed though. I should just do it and get it over with. that approach never works for me, but never say never right. it should be very simple to do if I get there on time this time. getting a little hungry now, but I will finish this, only have 5 more minutes anyways. damn just remembered an embracing moment in Deutschkurs (German class) freaking had a voice crack, och. hate speaking in front of others, don't know why. draws people to look at me I guess, and I'm not comfortable with that. has to do with a self esteem problem. am working on fixing that by making myself get use to attention. don't know if that is the right thing to do, maybe might learn something about it in this class. (one reason why I took the class, and sure for some people as well ) noticed the brackets I have been putting all over this. seems like my consciousness is explaining something to me. that a interjoke. oh times up.

273,"Right now I am in my friend's Jester dorm to do my writing 1 with her computer. I will probably do all my writing assignments in her room because all the other computer labs in the U. T. campus are always full. It is really annoying when I have to wait to use a computer. I just don't have time to wait, since I have so much homework to do. I feel very nervous and uneasy about all my classes because this is my first year in college. People told me that the method of studying in college is different from high school. I am still not use to living in the dorm. It is too small and just doesn't feel as comfortable as home. I miss my parents, my dog, and the freedom to drive my car out. I am going to work very hard in college in order to have a very successful life. My leg and arm muscles are aching, since I played basketball and worked out at the Rec Center yesterday. I like the facility there. There is a good variety of things to do. I plan to reserve time everyday to play sports, especially basketball and tennis. The Boyz II Men new song called ""The Four Seasons"" is in my head right now. I enjoy listening to the song. It sounds very sweet and peaceful. The song reminds me of the time when my mom and dad send me off to here at U. T. I am now listening to the movie called ""Space Jam. "" My sister and my friend are in the room watching the movie. I saw the movie about half a year ago. I thought it was a very cute movie. It is amazing how the creators of the movie can mix animation with real people. My favorite basketball player, Michael Jordan, is one of the main characters in the movie. I like to watch him play basketball because he always makes incredible shots. It is so cool when Michael makes a slam dunk. He really does fly a little. I hope tomorrow will be a good day for me. I hope I won't be very nervous when I go into my classes. I have four classes to go to tomorrow! I am really excited about seeing my senior U. T. cousin tomorrow!  ",1
71,"It's 5:27 and I am beginning this assignment. It's an interesting one. You never really pay attention to how your mind jumps from one thing to another, at least I don't. My roommate just came in. She thinks I am mad at her and I am a little. I'm always waiting on her and it's annoying. I hadn't eaten anything all day and I was about to go to the cafeteria and she wanted me to wait for her . Thirty minutes later we start walking to the cafeteria and she decides she's not hungry. I had waited for nothing. We get along very well, but I don't think she realizes what she does. She keeps interrupting me while I'm writing this and it's timed. She got mad at me just now because I asked her to be quiet. She left the door open and there's someone playing their music pretty loudly. I really don't like the girls next door. We get along with the girls who live a couple of doors down very well. The one's next door just aren't very friendly. My roommate heard one of the girls slamming stuff around and griping because I was playing Ozzy Osborne. One of them is in choir and she's always doing voice exercises. I hope my roommate doesn't start acting like I'm mad at her or vice-versa. She's on the phone. Her guy problems are pretty entertaining. I try to help her out, but I really can't empathize with her. She has a completely different approach and understanding with the opposite sex. Zack is going back to Graham tonight. He's one of my friends from home. I've known him since kindergarten. I've also been infatuated with him since kindergarten. Maybe he'll decide he likes me too. I doubt it though. That's a depressing thought. Oh well. There are plenty of other guys around here. In Graham there were not even close to as many. Population:9,000. Graduating class: 134. That's why I came here. I wanted to be in a place with many other people. I have definitely found that place. A lot of people from Graham thought I was crazy for wanting to come here. I guess different people want different things. it makes sense. One of our friends from down the hall just came in. She's very cool. She's going to let me use her computer to type this, which is sweet of her. It's very beneficial to know people. Everyone has something to offer. Of course, you have to give also. Some are better at that than others. I know IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve given plenty of cigarettes. Hopefully I've contributed more than just that. I've offered advice, which of course I always thought was good advice. I've tried to be friendly. I've given complements. I've loaned money and shared food. O. K. , I've done my part so far. I think school is going to go well. I just can't let people take advantage of me like I have in the past. I think I can manage the academic  part pretty well. The only thing that is difficult so far is Calculus and that was to be expected. I've been doing my best though, and that's all I can do. ",0
1208,"Well, I've never really done a stream of consciousness writing, so hopefully this will be a good experience for me. Right now, I'm thinking about thinking about writing this, its kind of weird to just record everything that crosses your mind because you get weird recursive loops like that. Recursion is the idea that a certain function calls itself, or in layman's terms, an idea that is selfreferencing. I think Stephen was the one who taught me about the idea of a selfreferencing mathematical idea. I just found out today that the classes I plan on taking over the next 3 and a half years will earn me a BS in Computer science, and a BS in Mathematics. At first I just wanted to take a minor in mathematics, but when I was talking to Dr. Turner today he told me that I should check to see how much of the major I would be completing. I hope a double major will help me get into grad school. Right now I really want to go to Carnegie Mellon to do my grad work. They have a really great CS program there. That's assuming of course that I remain a CS major over the next few years. But I don't see my interests changing or anything. I really wonder how well shy people can perform stream of consciousness. We're really not good at expressing our thoughts, especially to other people. Luckily this is typed and not spoken. Well, that's both good and bad, typing runs much more slowly than speaking, but its easier to express my self through text than through words. I misspelled consciousness earlier, and it got underlined red. Its really bugging me, so I think I'll go fix it right now. I know that if I look around my room I'll see something that I want to talk about. Usually that subject will be computer related. Its really sad. (Sad but true dear reader) Why does that make me think of high school. Weird flashback I guess. Never really popular or anything, although the last two years were awesome because I had a great group of friends and together we were really outgoing and audacious. All extremely intelligent. I wish I could meet more intelligent people here. Most of the people I know are either average, or just plain dumb. I did meet some cool people in my CS 307 class. But its too early to tell if they're truly intelligent, or just book smart. That reminds me of the math problem I solved today. Professor Freed always gives out a few homemade math problems on his assignments. He encourages us to attempt them, but he says its ok if we don't actually finish them or anything. Well, so far I'm the only one I know who came up with a solution to his problem. The last part was awesome because it required the use of a computer. I wrote a dinky little program in C to compute all the data, and then I pasted it all into Excel to plot it. Right now I have another program like that running. Its been running for about 140 hours right now. Something like that. Its growing neural networks to survive in a certain situation. These aren't any old artificial neural networks though, they're growth modeled. (my idea). So I hope this new batch of data continues to support my hypothesis. The rhythmic clicking of the keys is kind of distracting. It reminds me of our last psych class, when the girl I sat by thought that if you could type faster than you could write, it was pretty fast. I really disagree. Writing free hand is an extremely slow process, typing goes much faster because the letters are formed instantly when you hit the key. You can't program as fast as you can type so it really doesn't matter for me except in word processing like this, where I need to be able to type as fast as I can or I can't remember what I was thinking. I wonder how long I've been typing. Probably at least 15 minutes. I really haven't been keeping time. Oh well, once this hits a page on size 12 times new roman, that's going to be a lot of text in a fixed point font (like its going to be when I paste it on the web). My DVD player comes in pretty soon. I've been waiting for at least a month because the first one I got didn't work, and then the company ran out of them. I need to buy some DVDs for it. Probably will get the Utena DVDs even though they don't cover the really good episodes at the end. I like anime. ",1
1756,"the thought of everyone or anything making sense is no sense at all. people or things are living to be apart of the same things. to understand the most simplest of things is to want to understand the hardest of things. if we were to understand all that is around us then what? we seem as humans to conquer all that is unknown or well known as something we can overtake. why is this? if we understood everthing about ourselves then would we conquer overselves and in turn become so self absorbed that it turns out for the worst? maybe our own minds are the foundation and key to unlocking every mystery that lies in this world. that may be the reason that it is so complicated, since it does not want to be discovered in fear of damnation. we find ourselves seeking that which is not wanting to be sought after. maybe if we just left the hinding unknown come to the surface on its own then the world would be more peaceful than ever. we want to satisfy and gratify each other yet nothing is truly workin as a whole. in that case why don't we curse each other? would this work? there wouldn't be heroes without tragic situations that call on them. there wouldn't be compassion without suffering. this may be the other mystery of life. we suffer from all sorts of pains. anxiety, stress, and heartache. then this may be the key to how the  world goes round. there must always lie a purpose or mystery to be solved or individuals would possibly goe mad. living without purpose. the sights that are before us lie challenges that we all must go through. . animal. man. all the same in our   civilized  , yet primal instincts. we find that the more of one thing evolves another becomes a mystery. we try to understand our primal side of existance yet this is where we come from. our strive to learn, succeed, or conquer friends and foes. the animal coming out of us? no the animal coming back to us. these triumphes or downfalls are the minds tricks on itself that keeps everthing from total damnation. if we did unlock the nooks and crannies of our world then what then. find a way to kill or destroy it. with everything else we have. from finding how the world turns, our habits have caused an imbalance of many levels. the people all around us are capable of so much together that the universe wouldn't stand a chance. but that may be the reason we coannot truly get the whole picture of how we really feel for one another. the thoughts that we have are very primal. we seek out our sexes to comfort a zone but not a domain. if we all truly united then our common strength could destroy rntire galaxies since we have already done fractions of that with partial unification. this may be the clue to how realtionships may work in general. we find ways to unite and ways to spread out. everything that may be silly to an outsider like colthes, sex, or religion. these pose for issues that seperarte us at the same time. the same that our animal instincts may tell us as they come back and not come out as many think. think about the possibilities. or the downfalls. mysteries of any sort are our key that may never be unlocked       ",1
63,"  I like the idea of doing class assignments over the WWW. it's much easier. I think someday all assignments and teaching will be done through a web of interlinked computers. Students will sit at home in the same spot every day and fulfill their college requirements without ever seeing a professor or fellow student. I wouldn't like that however. Something would be lost without the direct personal lectures. A person telling me something with a unique style and delivery leaves a greater impression on me than any computer text ever could. I feel like I'm sticking with this subject too long, I'm thinking with too much structure. But I think that is the way I am. Before I communicate, whether by typing on a computer or talking to someone, I usually have a solid idea of what I'm going to say. I don't usually have spontaneous outbursts or a direct communication of a free flowing consciousness. I hear someone whistling in the hall, he's probably an active who will make me clean some mess up. oh well. Wow I reached the second line, I just figured this entire submission would be one never ending line of text; like some huge sentence that rambles on and on and says nothing. Isn't that ironic. I have something in the back of my head that says all this writing is just meaningless rambling. But if this is an exercise to allow my free flowing mind to be translated onto paper, that would mean that what I'm thinking is just meaningless rambling. It's always like that. My mind just jumps from random thought to random sensation (this chair isn't too comfortable) at light speed. No matter how fast I write, I don't think I could ever capture the zany, random, chaotic, and highly elusive thoughts that tickle my neurons for a millisecond then become forgotten in the same instant. But if they become forgotten how do I know about them?  I wonder what I'll do tonight. I'm not sure at all. It's one of those times when I could have fun doing anything. I might. I don't know. it doesn't even matter. I don't know what else to write. I'm at a loss. Maybe by brain just hopped down a frequency. I just went from the imaginative (sort of) colorful thought chord (you know the kind you get when you read a good sci-fi book), to a superficial lethargic tone. I feel like a cave man, the only thing my mind says right now is ""food. ""  Thank you. ",1
1847,"     As of now I wonder what will become of me at the University of Texas. These first few weeks have opened up many new experiences to me. Being able to make decisions by myself and not have to worry what my parents think is weird to me. My dad was the principal at the same high school as me which limited me to what I could and couldn't do due to the fact that he had a reputation to uphold in the community. Back in my home town people would associate me with my dad and hold me to different standards than everyone else at the school, but in college I don't have to worry about my fathers reputation and I can be the person that I really want to be. This is strange because my whole life I have had to worry what other people think of me, but these last few weeks my whole life style has changed. It is strange living away from my home town because many of my friends are there and I have lived there all of my life. I am sure I am going through the same things many other freshman are going through right now. Having to meet new friends and find my place in Austin is harder than I thought, but at the same time I like Austin a lot more than I like my hometown. My roommate is cool and it seems like we will get along fine over the year. I was worried that I would get a bad roommate because I have heard so many horror stories about bad roommates, but I guess it turns out that I was lucky. I can't wait for the next UT football game. I missed the first one against North Texas but I have my ticket for the one against Houston. Many of the people that I already know up here are going to be tailgating and have invited me to go with them to the game. Hopefully during this time I will get to see some of my ex-neighbors that I grew up with. The television is starting to get on my nervous because some dumb movie is playing and this monkey keeps making stupid noises. I find it hard to try and write for 20 minutes straight. To follow my thoughts is hard because it seems I try to hide them even from myself. I think this might be due to the fact I could never say what I thought when I was growing up. I always had to follow the   norm   and if I didn't my parents would scold me and tell me not to think that way. Since my parents both come from a more traditional up-bringing I don't have as many experiences as other kids have had.    ",0
1488,"At this moment I am in the FAC computer lab typing away among about 100 other students. Being a freshman, these first couple of weeks have been VERY hard of me. I live at home and commuting, to me at least, isn't a problem. But to other people, it is. They can't believe that I do. They think I have no life, won't make any friends and will be stuck at home my entire life. Which some of that is true. I do have a life, SCHOOL! I'm not going to UT to make friends, I'm paying to go here to get an education and make something of myself. Not to party on the weekends, get drunk, have sex with random people and ""buy"" my friends by joining a sorority. I probably will live at home during my undergraduate career. And why not? I live 15 miles away, why spend $8000 on room and board? I saves SO much money. I have a big family, 7 people. My older sister will be going to Medical school in two years, I plan on law school, my little school wants to be a doctor too and my little brother doesn't know yet. That much education, plus tons of other expenses add up. We could afford to live on campus, but I like my room and bed at home. We're hoping not to take out any loans for all my siblings and mine education, since taking and charging interest go against my religion, Islam. But enough of that. My classes are going well, except for this class, to be honest. I haven't done the reading. Which I better do soon, and I know I will. I've heard James is a good teacher, and I'm a great student, so there shouldn't be a problem. I know most people, especially freshmen, are too busy being distracted and having fun that all they care about is passing the class, or making a B. Which is fine. I really want an A though. Difficult to most people isn't that hard to me, I've always been in AP classes and I can handle working hard, which not a lot of people can, and not a lot of people want to. Besides school though I have two jobs. One at Tinseltown USA, and a box office person, selling tickets. And the other at Kaplan Test Prep, as an student advisor. I hate the latter. I wanted to quit so bad but they begged me to stay since a lot of people are leaving. The managers are SO rude to the students, which is SO wrong because they are paying $1000 to come there. But I only work Sunday, so it's all right. I don't have a boyfriend, which I sometimes wish I did. I want a companion, someone I can always talk to and someone that will listen to me and love me. It's really lonely not having someone like that. There are guys I would date, but either they wouldn't date, they haven't asked yet, or I can't date them. The can't category being one of my managers from work. He is the nicest guy I have ever met in my entire life. He's genuine, caring, goodlooking and funny. He deserves THE BEST. He's only 25, which is 7 years older than me. I'm pretty sure he doesn't have feeling for me, and that's ok. I like the friendship we have now. I can talk to him about whatever I need to and he'll always be considerate about it. I wonder no one has taken him yet? I would if I was ready to get married. I've taken a few weeks off from my theatre job so I don't see him. Twenty minutes has gone by, but I like this. I didn't to clear my head. It's a good thing there is a writing assignment like this. I almost want to keep a journal now, which I've heard is a good idea. I think I'm going to go eat now, and then go to an SI for this class. :) ",1

1611,"     I want some ice cream. I will go get some as soon as I finish typing this. I wonder is someone is reading this because otherwise how can the computer analyze this?  Tomorrow is going to be a busy day. too much studying to do. Maybe I should have done this on Friday morning. Oh well, I procrastinate too much so maybe this is a good thing. Gosh twenty minutes is a long time, especially when you are waiting to go get ice cream!  I'm not even hungry, but I haven't had ice cream is so long. Why do the guy floors in this building keep serenading?  Seems kind of odd that guys would do that for strangers. I like my room. It's very colorful, but I would still like to add more decorations. Perhaps more butterflies because it is a unique touch. Gosh, only a quarter done. I want my ice cream!!! Aww I can hear people yelling. how annoying. I would study in the library, but it seems kind of scary. This morning was scary. Yeah, I am never going to run by myself anywhere at 4:30 in the morning. I don't know if I want to make Texas Crew or not. It seems really cool and I got a rush just from exercising this morning, but on the other hand, it is also tiring, expensive, and I have to go through the trouble of finding a ride every day so I won't have to walk all the way to First Street again. Hmmm, I'm having trouble thinking of stuff. Oh I did not like today's   quote of the day  . It had something to do with God making the Earth round. I wanted to erase it, but I figured that might be a little rude. The sign should say   Monica's quote of the day   since I don't really care and I don't choose which ones go up there. I should have a   Drawing of the day   or something silly like that. Yeah, maybe of the week so I won't have to do so much. I prolly shouldnt' have typed that bit about today's quote, considering she is standing like a couple of feet behind me. Man sometimes I am so evil, but deep down I believe I am good. Oh my goodness, I am only halfway done. Do I have to keep writing like this?  I'm not sure if I really think about stuff this often. I may be just searching for topics to write about. Kind of like small talk, which by the way I cannot stand, partially because I am no good at it. I can't wait until this weekend's field trip to Port Aransas!  I havent been on a field trip since like elementary school. Well, on a good field trip. Maybe that's because there is nowhere interesting to go in Texas, er Houston. This weekend is going to be so much fun, hopefully. I like a lot of the Women in Natural Sciences girls. A couple of the white girls seem kind of cocky though. Like my next door neighbor. She is never smiling, and she only comes over to talk if she wants something, such as markers. She came over the other day to ask for markers because she didn't want to use her sharpies because she said they would run out. Um, okay. so it's okay if other people's stuff runs out? Geez, and I see her talking to the professors alot trying to suck up. She annoys me already. Whoohoo only a minute and a half left! That's really what I'm thinking. Also I want to play ping pong downstairs with Edwina and Athena, but I probably don't have time because I procrastinated this weekend. Dang it. okay I will just wait for the time to run out. 10. 9. 8. 7. 6. . 5. . 4. 3. 2. 1. yay ",0
1341,"Um. well I don't know where to start. This is extremely weird and I feel like I am just going to start rambling on and on. I think I'm thinking too hard for this little assignment and it's driving me crazy I guess I'll just go off on tangents and type away. I am so bored out of my mind and everyone around me right now is talking about being hungry and going to get something to eat. I shouldn't have eaten that can of soup and should have waited and gone some place good wit my friends. What am I thinking what am I thinking about. This is so much harder than I though. I thought things were just going to flow and I'm sure that they usually do but since I'm concentrating so much things are flowing like they usually do. I'm so stressed out right now. For some reason I feel like I have a world of things to do, do I? Well I know that when I think to hard about all the things I have to do it seems like I'm never going to finish doing what I have to do. In the long run though things seem to work and yeah I'm not going to freak out. I think right now I'm going to go back to my apartment and plan out exactly what I have to do for the rest of the day then get a pen and just scratch out as I go along. I know that I'll fall asleep though. I've been so lazy lately. I think I should start running to get my blood flowing but I know myself and it'll never last. Well who knows we'll see what happens, I could just go home and clean the apartment that would be a good work out. I think I'm thinking too much about unimportant things I guess who cares I'm just going to do whatever I want to do as things come to my mind and I'm not going to force myself into jogging around and sweating then never wanted to run again. Holy cow! This is not fun at all I'm running out of thoughts and this is just becoming words jumbled on to a paper. I wonder if I'm suppose to have paragraphs and stuff oh well too bad. Is this suppose to be something important or say something about myself. If it wasn't for having to type this my day would be complete I could take a nice long nap without having to worry about getting this out on time! Ugh! Okay I wish I could just live in Austin and not go to school. I wonder what I'm going to do tonight? Nothing is fun anymore it's always all the same stuff. Um well jayne and them are coming in from San Antonio so we'll see what happens. This movie is so cheap I laugh at the stupid parts even though they make no sense what so ever. What a mess what a mess. Ugh I need to clean up my home today so bad I don't want to! I clean up and two seconds later it's a mess all over again. Okay well I'm thinking my time should be up. Is it up yet. Yes two minutes and them I'm done. I'm starving all of a sudden. I'm so frustrated with this whole thinking process It's just a mess I hope we don't have to do this all the time. I think I'm going to be disappointed when I read back on this. I'm going to see that not one productive thought runs through my mind in 20 minutes. That is so pathetic. I wonder what would happen if I didn't have to do this and I started jotting down my thoughts. Okay time is up. ",1
500,"I don't have enough time in my day for important schoolwork, studying, work, rest time, AND enough sleep to make me feel good. I haven't even left myself enough time on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays for lunch. What was I thinking making those work hours for myself. I gave myself 30 minutes to get to class. I have to wake up in the morning and work from 9 until whenever I get off to get to class in 30 minutes. that's no time to even stop and think or do an errand here and there. I had to go home this weekend to get a bunch of homework and studying done. I have one of the busiest weeks this week. Everything seems to be due on the same day, but thankfully not the same hour. When can I sleep?  I have to write four menus for four dinners of twenty people and write the ingredients list and have everything organized and typed. At least I can type and work here late at night. it is a getaway from my hot house and hot room. I should stay here all night one night. it's so cool and comfortable in here. I have to clean sometime today in between classes. the only reason I have time for anything now is because I didn't work today. I had to wake up with not enough sleep and I didn't even work today. I guess it's good though because I'm getting this and the pretesting done and that's important. I wonder if we get some sort of receipt for doing this like we are supposed to in the pretesting. I hope so it would be my luck that it doesn't get submitted. if someone is reading this, it was submitted. I wonder if anyone is actually reading this. it makes me so mad and frustrated with the mail system. it's always the really important letters and mail that gets lost. why did it have to be  that letter that got lost?  I have to go to some building to get my password for receiving email because I can't remember my password. I have to also pick up my financial aid check. maybe it's in the same building. I can't help correcting my errors as I type. it's a habit thing. my finger automatically goes to the delete key when I see an error. at least now I can what was I typing??? I think faster than I type and I type pretty fast, but as I type one thing I'm thinking of something else. it's weird to write down what you think. I don't usually think ""oh I'm thinking about this"" I just think. thought just go through my head. usually the thoughts that I really hear are the worried and stressed out thoughts because I know I'm slacking already and what is it like the 3rd week of school? has it been 20 minutes yet?  when you watch the time, it goes so slow. maybe that's what I should do to savor my time. just watch it. if I could watch a clock as I sleep it would be perfect. my sleep time would be good and long. well it's been twenty minutes. it makes me feel good that I got this done. that's one thing on my long list of things to do. What if they don't like my menu for the week?  it's too boring. the menu for this week has so my variety. oh I don't care. I have to stop thinking or I'll never stop writing. ",0
1622,"      I am a little irritated right now. I just did this thing for about 5 minutes and then my computer just like shut off!  I cannot believe I just spent those five minutes only to just have it all erased. Things like that irritate me a lot. I always just hate having done something and then it being useless. I guess that could be kind of an insecurity but yeah. I am not going to psychoanalyze myself. I guess since this is one of thise things that could do that for me. I wonder if this will get picked to be read. Probably not. Its getting done way early. I can't really see the reasoning behind the whole stream of consciousness thing. I mean yeah you can track your thoughts but couldn't you do that just by paying attention to yourself?  I dunno. just one of those things I guess. Moving on then. I'm eating a rice krispeys treat thing. I get hungry when I am irritated. I have to wonder how evolution made us that way. What is the point of eating when you are irritated. Shouldn't you want to do stuff?  that would make sense in the whole flight or fight mode sense kind of way. I am glad i have an apartment it doesn't smell here and the neighbors are really nice. Of course  you don't make a forced acquaintance like you would if you lived in a dorm I guess but this is more private and I can work on the bills and homework alone. Maybe I'll go out tonight with one of my new friends. I don't have plans and I'm not really interested in going to the game, as if I had the money to go anyways. Money is going to become an issue later. I should try and get a job this semester but i just don't want to get burnt out on my first semester. I don't really need the money but it would be nice in case of an emergency. And who doesn't like a little extra spending money?  I don't know i need to find somewhere close to work but i don't want to have to work as a cashier again. I hated doing that. Not as much as working as an area host(janitor) at a certain theme park. Not at all fond memories of the sausage shack and the bathrooms accompanying it around high noon. Its stupid how people have no real common sense when they go out to have fun. Honestly, who doesn't realize that a urinal is not made to be pooped in. It would hate to know the person who didn't understand what a urinal . URINal, is for its use is right there in the name c'mon people!  But yeah my lips are chapped really bad. I should find my chapstic otherwise I'll smile at someone and then make a weird face because I split my lip. Eminem is on now. Repeat of the MTv Movie Awards. He's not really a bad rapper assuming I can even even judge that music. But he honestly is about the whole shock value of his music probably. Just like many of his little fans. I have a really nice view of the septic area behind the aparmtments an dthe little balcony shows a wonderful scene of the vagrants coming out of the woods. I got that last part from a couple of my neighbors. The one seemed really witty, another was very . bubbly, and of course there was the one with a boyfriend. They are really nice I hope to get to know them more. Wow its almost time to stop the whole stream of consciousness. Just four more minutes. My nipples itch. I think its because of the new shirt I'm wearing. Wow that was kind of out there. You know what's funny assuming   you   were a person and could reply that is. I hope I don't become one of those people who just talks to themselves all the time.  But the funny thing is that I have a pencil sharpener in my room. Yet I only have mechanical pencils  That seems kind of pointless. Oh that is kind of punnish. I really need to find a book to read. I hate not having something immediate to do. Doing nothing is just not a strong suit. I miss my family now that I think about it. I think I'll give them a call today. I don't want them to think I don't care about them even though I'm away.  ",1
677,"Well, I really don't know what to talk about now. I can't really think of what I am feeling. I guess relaxed and at the same time stressed. I have so much chaos in my life now that I can't even think straight. I just moved to a new city and a new home. I joined a soroity where I am suppose to meake all new friends in 1 week or less. I have a boyfriend that is non-exsistent in my life now. I have school work that I don't even know how to work on. I am just a mess. I am going home next weekend so maybe that will calm my nerves. I was very much overwhelmed when I came here about 3 weeks ago. I wasn't ready at all for this new experience in my life. I was but I wasn't at the same time. I was so ready to leave my parents but not to be on my own all the time. I sometimes feel depressed that I have no life but in actuality I really have it the best. I am waiting for my ""boyfriend"" to come and see me tomorrow. I have been waiting for 2 weeks. Don't know how long it will last. There are a lot of guys here that are also interested. I don't know. One minute I feel upset and just want to cry and roll up and the next I just want to go out and have so much fun. I miss my parents and brother so much. My dogs are also important to me and I dearly miss them. In high school I never use to study and now I am forced to or I will fail. Which the tachers don't give a crap about if anyone fails or not. In high school they did. I have so much to get use to and I am scared to tell the truth. I don't know why this is a question because no one will read this so I won't get into a lot. I am having fun though. I have met some really cool people and I know we will be friends for a long time. My soroity has also been a big aspect in my life right now. AEPhi is the name of it. I feel comfortable there and I know I will enjoy it immensley. Well, I don't know what else to talk about. I hope everything will turn out for the better and I can realx and actually enjoy myself and everyone else. ",0
2323,"I feel cold, my toes are really brittle feeling, I want to get in my bed right now, it is so warm in there, I feel closest to home went I am under my covers trying to sleep, the best feeling ever in the world is being really cold and then jumping into a warm bed that is what I want right now, if my new dorm wasn't so cold I wouldn't be rambling about this topic but wow is it cold although I do enjoy is freezing at night during the day I wouldn't mind a little heat I mean come on now at camp all summer it is so warm I just want to burst every time I walked outside I got that amazing warm sensation over my whole body I remember it so clearly that thawing feeling well I who'll get my hopes up here I am now in college in the cold away from friends and family and camp but I shouldn't feel so isolated sitting in this cold and unhomely room well I should this place is absolutely depressing ha-ha that is so funny how in class we talk about depression and more sleep is associated with it and I totally know that I will be napping after this assignment but no really college is the time of your life or so I am told but so far my two weeks at ut have not been the greatest of my life but then again I have herd stories about people coming here and not liking it for awhile and then they magically start to have fun this is not a cry for help by the way you know the one you warned us about not writing because it would not be read well that is not what this is I am just thing about me and how different I am it is strange the qualities I posses I always think that I am unique and different but there are a million people out there one has to be like me but the more I think about myself the more I am convinced that there is absolutely no one else like me on one side I feel lonely but realistically I love my friends because of the differences between us I feel like all I have is me with your best friends you can tell them anything in the world about how you are feeling and you can trust them and now all those people are gone and when I talk to them on the phone it is just not the same and we seem to be growing a greater distance apart wow I just realized what a sob story this is this is not a cry for help at all what roommate just walked in and totally broke the sob story train I mean he is a nice guy and all and we will get alone fine and everything for a whole year but I definitely don't think that we will be best friends or anything and I really am not going to make a conscience effort to befriend anybody I am quite satisfied all by my self in this way I am really different I mean yes all people need to belong to the group and have friends and fit in but I think that I just have I stronger resistance to such social things as that besides a lot of people have told me that they were never friends with their roommates but that they did have a lot of fun with them so maybe I should be more open to the idea of hanging out with the guy even though he reminds me of a phony awe Holden cawfield I can't say phony without thinking about Holden cawfield from catcher in the rye I really shouldn't have read that book at the age I did it turned me on in weird ways and I don't think I understood ",0
1828,"I really don't know what the heck this is all about but i guess I will just write stupid stuff that I am thinking about. I am a really slow typer and whenever I am being timed on something it makes me nervous and I mess up a lot. So, if someone is reading this I am sorry if i make a lot of mistakes. I have a ton to do toinght and i really want to go to bed early because i have a 9 o'clock class in the morning. as soon as i get finished with this, i need tot call this girl in my physical science class and get our lab assignment from her becasue i didnt have my book last time. that is going to be really difficult because i don't have her number. hopefull i can call around and get it form somebody. She is in my sorority so it isnt completely hopelss. my roommate is watching this movie that is really gettign on my nerves. the people are making these shorrible dieing noises. it sounds so gross. anyways, back to my to do list for tonght: after i do that i need to go pick all of that stuff up and tranfer all of our data to my book which will take forever and i have only been writing for 6 minutes and i really feel like this is a waste of my busy night but thats ok a t least i am getting it over with. I am so glad that is due this friday. for some reason i had it written down that it was due last friday and i was really mad this morning when i thought i had missed turning this in. because these are easy points that i definately need. i love classes that give you extra things besides tests because i am not always te best test taker, so anything extra really helps. i really like peenebaker a lot, except he goes really fast through the material and i get kindof lost, but thats why i like the discussion sessions. i really think that those are going to help me. i am froma small high school and so i am used to small classes so those discussions are very comfortable for me. i am from midland and i think on the first day that he said he was from midland but i couldnt really hear him. i know he made a comment about midland vs. odessa an i  liked that one. i hate it when people always try to lump them together. it really gets on my nerves because they are so different. i went home to midland this last weekend because i got ina wreck on friday night. it really sucked because that was my fiirst wreck. i just backed into someone so it wasnt a big deal nut i think that it is going to be really expensive. it is getting really hard for me to concentrate because i am listening to one of my roommates talk ont eh phone and i keep gettig distracted and wanting to type what she is saying. oh my ogsh- its only been 13 miutes. this is insane. i don't know how much more of this i can take. my wrists are starting to hurt. oh now he getting off the phone. now i got really distracted because she was trrying to talk to me and now i have totally lost my train of htought which hass probaba;y defeating the whole purpose of this writing assignment. oh well. see now i can't think of anything to talk about. oh yes about going home this weekend. i had a wreck so i went to show my dad my car and ( i just got distracted again) and i went to my sisters football game. she is a cheerleader and this was her first varsity game to cheer at. she is a sophomore. i remember my first varsity game. i was so nervous. i was a freshman though. my year they let freshman try out for varsity bacuse of some conflicts the year before. so me and one other girl were the only girls ever to be on varsity for four years. it was kindof cool. i letter four years in a row. i was the only one that graduated a four year letterman because karah(hte other girl) quit her senior year. it was really sad. oh yeah i only have 30 more seconds left. i am so glad that this is almost ov        ",1
2457,"     Yaaaaay. I'm doing psychology things. I'm really tired. And I wish I didn't' have to study so that I could go to sleep. I also wish I could type faster. I'm glad I'm here. Because being almost anywhere is better than being in Baytown. Except for being in Houston. Houston is all concrete and construction. But UT has squirrels. And lots of them. . What am I going to say in the whole 20 mins. I have to say anything I want? . Will people actually read this?. I guess I don't care if they do. Because I'm the type of person that thinks it's pointless to write for my own enjoyment. I get enjoyment out of other people reading what I write and then them enjoying it. . Hmm. I miss my boyfriend. Even tho he made me ANGRY last nite. He's still a nice and good boyfriend. On another totally random note. I've got this pimple on my face. Hahaha. It hurts! And it bothers me too! I want it to disappear! Not that it makes me look bad. I actually think it makes me look somewhat cute! hahah. That's kind of weird. Oh well. I wish I had a memory card for my playstation so I can finish Final Fantasy 8. At this rate. It'll take me YEARS to finish it. But maybe this is for the better. So I can study instead of play, because I would definitely be playing that and Metal Gear Solid. But. Only on weekends. Hahaha. I'm a girl that plays video games. I'm weeeeeiiiiiirrrrd. I wonder if I can get that job at the LanCave. I would be EVER SO HAAAAAPPPYYY. That would be awesome. It doesn't seem hard at all. just like the same stuff I did at eb but instead of renting people games I sold it to them. I don't miss eb at all. I wonder if Julia left yet. That place is the devil. And video games are the spawn of the devil. . I wonder what Marky is doing over at UofH. I hope he's having fun and he's not regretting his decision to go to UofH instead of UT. yah. We used to be big UT heads. Then he changed his mind and I changed my mind. And then I changed my mind again. And the I changed my mind back again to UT and now here I am. Woot woot go me. I think I'm getting carpal tunnel syndrome. I hope there's free therapy after this writing exercise. blaaaaaaah. I haven't met very many people that are into stuff that I'm into. Except for Maryam. I can't wait to meet some other dorky kids that are into videogames and Japanese and cute fashion stuff. I want to go to Anime Club on Friday. But I will be going all alone because I""m sure that Ashley will not come with me. But Maryam might! I totally forgot. I will call and ask her. But that means that I have to give up Wushu practice. Maaan. I have such big dreams. But I have no idea which ones to follow. That gets frustrating. Okay. If I decide to give up Wushu. Then maybe I can get into fencing. or maybe even Kendo. But wushu is so neeeeaaat! but I don't know if I even have the strength to do it. it's crazy. maybe I should not do and just try again next year. No hard feelings, I hope. I don't even know if I'll have money to pay for that. I hope I get ANY job on campus. I'm. just. Bleh. I hope I get to stop being so anti-social. I'm not really anti-social. just a bit shy and cautious about who I talk to. I think that's a good thing. However, it can be very lonely. My wrists hurt. I wonder if my brother is having fun at home. probably not. Lol. He never seems to be having fun when he's alone. Aww. Now I feel bad for leaving him. Maybe he'll be encouraged to invite his friends over to hang out or something. I don't want him to be all lonely like I was as a junior in high school. . I wonder if my older brother has decided to go to graduate school yet. Or if he's really thinking about that invention thing. Heh. At least he's got his major and he's doing it in 4 YEARS. go him. He's my hero. Hahaha. I'm glad he kind of knows what he wants to do, because I sure don't. I'm torn between wanting something that will be lucrative and people will really need, and doing something that I looooove to do with all my heart. I've found, thru various high school experiences and the first year long relationship, that I can learn to love almost anything. which is a bad thing. I have no idea what I'm really good at and have no idea exactly how to find out. I already feel like I'm running out of time right now as I sit here typing out a required assignment. It's crazy. And frustrating. And I don't' want to try to do too many things at once, because that is what caused my uber-dramatic downfall my senior year. Okay. Maybe it wasn't a downfall. But it did make me realize some stuff about being human that you would think I'd know already, having been a human for almost 19 years. Silly me. Oh well. It won't happen again here, because I'm not in Baytown and I'm away from people that drag me down. I can choose who to interact with most times here, so that puts me in a position of power I rarely have. Yaaay for college. very glad I'm here and not in Baytown. ",0

I have these  two writing assignments for psychology a whole bunch of pre-cal homework  and tons of reading to do for Biology and Sociology. this sorority stuff  is starting to take up way to much time. I really don't like the feeling I  am getting when I am set up with a date because it makes me feel like I am cheating on my boyfriend. I know I shouldn't feel bad since I am just being friends with them and nothing more it just really bothers me sometimes. I really don't feel like going out tonight because I still  think I am sick from yesterday. I need to go and call my mom and dad  since I haven't talked to them in about five days I am just way to busy. I think I really need to work on some major time management skills because I  am worried about getting behind and I want to get 3 As and 2 Bs so I can  start off good before my classes get too hard. I am really excited about  UT vs. OU weekend I hope that Jaycob can go so that I don't have to go with some random guy. I wish it wasn't the same weekend as my schools homecoming so that I could go home oh well. I need to take a shower and get ready  for the KA mixer and try to read and definitely watch 90210.

1472,"Three weeks ago I started out on an unforgettable journey through college. Although I have been preparing myself for this journey for what feels like forever, I don't think that one could ever be completely prepared for the adventures that lie waiting for them at The University of Texas. My school year started with a hectic and stressful week many people affectionately call rush. The name ""rush"" cannot even begin to describe the event that should be called ""stampede"". I can only imagine what hundreds of girls running around the UT campus in nice dresses and make up in the heat of August would look like to an innocent bystander that just happened to be on campus that day. With all of that over and behind me I thought that I could calm down for the start of school and get ready for the classes that were ahead of me. Boy was I wrong. I don't think that I have had time to sit down long enough to think since I have been here. My classes move so fast and the stress of walking from class to class without getting run over or getting lost is enough to make anyone go crazy. But, with every 15second brake that I get I have to sit back and enjoy the college experience that I am having. Sure I am busy, but the main reason I came to U. T. was to get out of my boring hometown and in to the always out of control city I now call home. I love it here and I can't imagine looking back on my college years with memories coming from any other place but Austin. ",0
205,"Homework, I hate homework. no it's not that. It's more like I hate the  obligation to be busy that it entails. Why is it that after finishing homework or exercises that you feel so great, but actually starting it is so stressful. Why is it that something that is so helpful is hard to motivate?  One would  think that lazy people would have been weeded out by natural selection by now  and it'd be easier for those left behind to get motivated. But from what I've  seen in the history texts, people aren't only not more motivated, they're less!! So if this goes on, it'll get harder and harder for people to get things done. And I'm already having enough problems as it is!   It makes me wonder if the human  race will survive to see a true 'space age'?  I mean, We've made so much  progress in that area already, but at the rate that apathy and disinterest that  sweeping through the population, it's quite possible that we'll never get off of our own little mudball in order to see what the other little mudballs circling a bunch of burning hydrogen look like. Not only that, but what about all these  alien theory's?  There is a truism (called that 'cause they're normally true)  that says, ""There is a seed of truth even in the most outrageous rumor""  So I  want to know what that seed of truth is!!  What, or who, is out there. If it's nothing, I want to find out. So maybe in my lifetime there will not be any  answers, but from heaven or hell or wherever I go, if indeed I go anywhere other than the ground, I want someone to somewhere figure out the answer!  Or that  there is not an answer. Oh, well. I think my twenty minutes are up. So  hopefully what little motivation I've mustered will result in more than just a  good grade (although that's good too!)

733,"I don't know where to start. My mind is full right now with all sorts of thoughts and feelings. UT is great but I am not sure where I fit into things right now. It is really just one big cycle for the time being. When I was driving here from Arlington, my dad told me that I would not hang out with any of the people I already knew because you will ""drift apart. ""  But I like my friends. I have two friends that are going to join a fraternity. I also have two friends who are not going to join a fraternity. The three of us have been going to some of the parties, trying to see if that is the route we want to go. For me, this has been a huge thing on my mind. Constantly. I want to fit in somewhere, but I am not sure I want to pay for it. It really is strange. All this thinking about social life leaves less time for study. Speaking of study, I have nothing to do but read. No busy work. Just reading. That kind of reading will fry your brain. This has been a weird week. Everything has changed. School, friends, family (or lack of). It is kind of cool, though. I am just kind of hoping that a routine starts here. It is really hard to keep learning a new schedule day in and day out. I simply want it to be easy. I guess that is what college is for. It teaches you to grow up. Now I have laundry to do. Just another fun thing to do. It really sounds negative, but my life is good, I guess. Just finished that 32 page questionnaire. While most of it was simple, it really does make you think. Especially when it asks, ""Are you certain about your answers?""  Who knows?  Do you like yourself? Of course. Are you sure?  Yep. I guess it would really suck though if you were thinking about killing yourself all the time. That never crosses my mind. It is too much fun to live. Challenging experiences though. Sure wish UT would have won yesterday. It was great yesterday. Went to a party, then to the game, then we lost. That just kind of ruins the whole effect. Back to the frat thing. We were supposed to go to party for the Sigma Chi's after the game. I really wonder if they try to be your best friend so you will join. Most of the guys are cool. But I think I am going to wait. They all say it is best to join 1st semester, but that is what ""they"" say. I believe my decision to wait should be respected, and if it isn't, then they aren't that cool anyway. I guess. I think I just need to meet more girls. That would make life much more enjoyable. That has got to be the answer. I have moved twice in my life and have always managed to meet people quickly. But at that point, I never knew the difference. Now it is hard. I think it is because of insecurity. I am really not afraid to admit it. I am insecure in meeting girls, but I will have to grow out of it. For now, I just wish I didnt have to read so much. It isn't that bad, just boring. You cannot retain 40 pages of economics in one day. It is just not possible. But I guess I will try my best. ",1
152,"At his time I am at the lab listening to everyone in here typing and some coughing as well. The laser printer doesn't seem to stop printing. I am at the Communications Computer lab doing this assignment. I am wondering whether or not I will be going home, Dallas, next week on Friday. I am hoping my friend will take me. I also hope I can bring back my sister, who is presently in Dallas, so that she can live with us. That way I don't have to worry about cooking or getting food for dinner. I am glad my Pre Calculus professor gave me permission to take my midterm on Monday, the day after I get back from Dallas--If I go. I just looked at the proctors. They are helping some people out with their passwords. I wish I could get a job as a proctor. I think that would be an easy way of getting some money. Most of them don't even know what they are doing. I just thought about my major. I hope I can get into the Texas Creative Department in Advertising. That would be really neat since I like to do stuff like that. I just read that a lot of students in advertising have earned awards. But I just looked at some of their work and I don't think it would be all that hard to do. I just looked at my watch, I have about fifteen more minutes before I can send this message. A lot of people are leaving the lab know. That stinks, I wish their was a better computer when I got here. Right now I'm stuck with this old IBM comp. --the only one in the lab that's still using Windows 3. 11. I wish I was home with my family right now. Especially since they left for Denver today. If only I didn't have school right now, then I could live at home and help my dad with our family business. A lot of these computers in here are down. It sure would help if someone would fix them. Jesse Holman Jones--so that's who this building is named after. Who is he?  I've never heard of him. The sign on the wall says, ""Lumberman, Banker, Publisher, Statesman. ""  What does that have to do with Communications(except ""Publisher""). I still have to do my rough draft for English. Oh well, I will probably do it tonight when I get home. Not like I can get any work done their. My brother is too loud and annoying. He doesn't let me study in peace. He is pretty stubborn--likes to have everything his way. Just because my parents aren't here, he thinks he's my guardian or something. I wish I lived in a dorm instead. That would have been cool. That way I could have met new people and friends. Not only that, it's right there on campus and they have cafeterias. That would help a lot. Now I only have six minutes to go. This thing is taking a pretty long time. If it weren't for this assignment I could have been working on my English paper right now. I hope that paper turns out good. At least my professor liked my proposal-he said I did an ""excellent job. "" In class he was saying how rare that case would be. Hopefully, I'll do well in this class. I really don't like English classes. Their so boring. All you do is discuss a lot of things, write papers, and practice grammar. I thought my English class would be very large, instead it ends up having only 25 people. I hate small classes. At least all my other classes have over one hundred people. Well, I'm done. I guess I will send now. ",0
2222,"I'm glad I'm doing this assignment right now, I can't wait until Friday so I can get hammered That's the guy that was eying me like I was going to steal something it's kind of hot outside I wonder if I should change before we go to Bennigins tonight. Did I spell Bennigan's right?  I hope I did the second time. Young Buck is a good lyricist. It's too bad he doesn't get that much shine. I feel like I'm going to get Carpal Tunnel Syndrome from all this typing. General, I salute. Lloyd Banks is good too. Damn, It's already seven o'clock and I'm just barely getting started on homework!  This running nose sucks. I picked a hell of a time to do this. I don't know why I get sick so often. I'd be great if I had health insurance. Why is that fool looking at me like that. What does he think I'm going to do?  He just doesn't know. Damn my muscles are so sore and I'm so tired. I got a good workout today. I like to reflect on my day towards the end, It's just what I do. Shit what the fuck do I do now?  I lost track, but now I'm back on track like a train. The Little Engine that Could is what you COULD call me. LOL that was so lame!  Why is Ben laughing?  I don't why I'm writing the dumbest shit. I'm pretty smart. I must be, I got into UT. Hook 'Them Horns!  Get off the phone!  Stop talking. What's up?  What's up?  What's Up?  Martin!   They don't know me up in here. Who do you love?  I love myself. I got sunshine on a cloudy day, when It's cold outside, I got the month of May. Too bad it's on September. Just two more weeks and I turn 20. That's going to be crunch, yaw know. Hell yeah!  My nose is stopping to run. There are a lot of hot girls in my Psych class. Shit, there better be, there's fucking 500 plus people in that class. Why do people look at me funny. I think it's the way I dress. Just thuggin it up. Oh hold up dog, you better let me in. Fuck that let's get in started come on, let's begin. I don't even know what to say next. I smoke everyday because I stay stressed. And stay dressed, fly fresh to death, head to toe until the day I rest. Just give me some air forces and fitted hat to match matter of fact give me two of those with a white new era, now who dares to. Even approach me. I'm known in the ATX, but in H-Town it's locally, express myself vocally cause I fight with words I ain't the one wild in out stay tight on curbs swerve right in burb, high like them birds. I'm feeling kind of lucky, you could call me Larry, you call me anything. Homie I don't ball with jokes so you could me anything, just don't call me broke. Most hated M to the is-h phenomenal get up and get straight in your abdominal I'm warning you, stop your blood clot, and keep your mouth shut, stop talking shit you don't know what I'm about OK now I'm back, used to be little, but now I'm stacked like change on the dresser and spot the fakes, the streets is like a jungle you got to watch these snakes, cause they'll come up and bite yaw, act like they like yaw, pour gasoline on yaw then ignite yaw, start the fire, just like Banks, my pockets fill with money just like Banks and dating girls who model, just like Banks ",1
557," I feel very awkward about having an assignment that doesn't give exact specifications as to what is supposed to be produced. I know I'm supposed to write about what I am feeling, but that is a very difficult thing to do for me. I don't usually tell anyone how I am really feeling ever. I'm worried that I might not be studying as much as I should be. I don't exactly know what to study for any of my classes. I mean I know I could read the texts, but I really don't think that would do me any good since I have yet to be lectured in any of my classes except for math. I hate math. I don't think my pre-calculus professor is very good at explaining anything. He is always getting side-tracked and making all kinds of mistakes. I don't think I'm going to do very well in his class and it really bothers me. I miss my boyfriend a lot. He is going to school in El Paso and I'm not going to see him for at least three more months. I tried living with him in El Paso for a couple of months but all we did is get on each others nerves. I was going to go to school with him, but I decided to move back to Austin because we were starting to hate each other and I missed my family a lot also. It's weird but we drive each other crazy when we are together and we miss each other like crazy when we are apart. I really don't understand it at all. I wonder about what he is doing a lot and miss him holding me at night. I know I need him and he needs me, and I really hate it. I have always thought of myself as the strong independent type who didn't need anyone, but I know the truth even though I would never admit it to even my closet friends. I wonder if my friend did okay at her new job orientation today. She was so excited when she got hired. I really feel insignificant sitting in this huge library, on this huge campus, in the middle of a huge state, writing about what I am thinking. I mean who really cares anyway?  People are always asking you how you feel, but I'm pretty sure they don't care how you respond. I know lots of times I ask people how they feel and then totally ignore them afterwards. I hate when people look at me in queer ways. I always wonder about what people are thinking of me when they look at me. I wish I didn't care, but I do. ",1
377,"I love it when things are like that, things have calmed down since I last wrote my entry. I have learned that indeed almost everyone else is feeling frazzled right now also. I had English today at 9 am and really enjoy it, I like my teacher a lot and have a small class, which I like also--more of a high school feel. It is my birthday tom. and I am not excited about it because I have really crazy classes tom. an 8am to 11am which nearly always kills me. All my friends are already talking about where to live next year and I am not sure why. They all say that things fill up so quickly. I got my feelings hurt because my best friend committed to someone else without even checking with me, I guess I had assumed we would live together next year. College is so much money. I feel like at every corner I turn there is another fine or whatever, even meals really add up. I am not working this first semester because my mom wanted me to adjust to college before having a work schedule, I am doing some babysitting though. Kids are my life, I do not know what I would do without them. I was thinking the other day, my dogs back in Houston--do they know I am gone? It made me sad to think they have no clue if I am OK, I am very close to them and it sucks to think they don't understand a move. My phone is ringing but I think I will ignore it, no one seems to call me but maybe that is why, I have gained a lot of weight and I can feel it, I am slower and get more tired quickly. I wonder how it will feel to 19! Almost 20, I feel like just yesterday I was at my 14th birthday party-a slumber party, often times I miss that stage in life, the innocence. a lot of my friends have changed since then and change is good, but I miss my friendships since then, all my friends are so different. Right now my friend Connor is here and she is sitting on my other friend's bed. She is thumbelina, so cute. There is a vacuum going on in the background, I really need to shave my legs. and lay out. My brother called me last night and said hi and he misses me, I miss him also but sometimes I wonder if he misses me driving him around, he is only 12. I want my older brother, who is 31, to have another kid, that would be so exciting for me. He already has two. I am a theta and I really like them. Tonight I am going to get yogurt with my mentor who has the same major as I do, she will give me advice on what to do and stuff for the future. My e mail is broken and I am so sick of my computer company because they do nothing about it. They are so slow. Now my friend has left the room, I feel like I can not say private things while she is in here, she was reading over my shoulder-how awkward, she wants to go eat in the cafeteria, and I am not hungry. I am scared for one of my friend's futures, she failed summer school and is doing bad at ACC and is not trying. she is depressed and stays in bed all day, it worries me. lunch at 11 am? is she crazy, I think the TV show Jerry Springer is so dumb and should not be aired, before all the fighting started no one really watched it and now everyone knows what it is because of that, how weird. I love beanie babies, they are so cute, but I do not understand why people pay so much money for them. they are beans in a bag, worth about 3 $ max!!!  I love the summer and am sad it is almost over!  My 20 minutes is up so bye bye. ",0
535,"for some reason I just don't find a hairy chest on a guy that asthetically pleasing, but if I shave will it grow back much thicker, there is only one way to find, I used to shave my legs in high school for sports and I don't have thick black hair now. I know this much if I were to shave my chest I would use the new mach three from gillette. for some reason , I have such an infatuation with this new razor over the past week since I bought it. I usually get razor burn no matter what I do before or after I shve, but with mach 3 I put it to the test and I didn't even get a scratch. I read something that said it was designed to make you want to get up at two in the morning and shave, I wouldn't take it that far but it is definatly a great razor, my frien just read his list of goals for the futrure to me as I was writting this, and one of them was to travel and see dave for a year, dave mathews, I couldn't agree more. what is it about his music that is so unbelievable, sometimes his lyrics don't make sense, but the whole band is so musically inclined and can just jam and do things at the drop of a hat that most other bands can't do, they just know each other so well. I looked at the clock and it hasn't been 10 minutes yet, come to think about I don't really sit around with a lot of things on my mind,  I am in a house with five guys so usually there is someone to talk to someone to talk to some one to talk to some one to talk to , no one to talk to right now and even if there was I couldn't because I can't type and talk at the same time I would type what I was talking or talk what I was writing, whatever, how can drummers carry on so many different beats at the smae time, somethimes two with their feet and two with their hands while singinglyrics, amazing, I play a little guitar , but when I try to strum and sing I get thrown off, not comfortable enough with the guitar yet though, I probably never will be though, I just got interupted and my train of thought  was ruined but I guess it isn't important, I think that assigments like this are interesting. not so much for the researcher but for the person writing. like me, I never really thought about what I think about. This is forcing me to do that. I am scared that the weather will never get back to normal- why wont it be cold where it is supposed to be cold?  I have a friend in Chile and he says that it did not snow there at all this winter, what is that?  Another thing that worries me is anal people?  Didn't Freud study those kind of people. One of the guys I live with is so anal that it hurts me to watch him worry about all of his stuff. He asked me today if I knew what happened to two of his hot dog buns and he asked me the other day if I knew if someone drank any of his milk because he noticed that someone had moved it. I don't know what is more sad about that. that he noticed or that he cared. I think that we should bring him in and study him for our class. What can we do with this kind of illness kind of thing- you know what I mean. That may have to be an entire unique number of its own- ""upper division standing required"" if you know what I mean. I am collecting loose change, it sits in a clear glass jar next to my monitor- I would guess that I have about 10 dollars in right now- you can't have a dime. ",0
1538,"     This is my first writing assignment of college. It doesn't seem like it could be so bad. In fact, college itself isn't so bad yet. Its not like i have any homework that is assigned. All my friends have homework constatnly that is due for them to turn in. Glad i am not in that situation. I guess that I am behind in schoolwork though. I need to read so many chapters in so many books. But who wants to read when I could be going out. The freedom here is wonderful. I don't think I have stayed out this late so many days in a row ever. It's amazing to me how much fun something as stupid sounding as an   80's theme   fraternity party could be. Fraternity parties are the best thing here i think. Free alcohol, no way to get caught under 21 (unless you are stupid), and guys everywhere. Of course, I have already skipped class because of hangovers. Or can you really call them hangovers if you are still intoxicated. I am not sure about that one. I have already met so many guys. I wish that i wasn't the way I am about guys. I wish I could just meet them and enjoy our time and then thats it. No, there is always one that i seem to get attatched to. I don't want to like anyone though. I am having to fight my usual ways to keep from liking just this one guy. I promised myself i wouldn't fall for someone for at least a year. I am sick and tired of being controlled by men. Boyfriends are always controlling and now that I don't want a boyfriend I am still being controlled by having to fight feelings of attatchment. Don't they say that you seek people similar to your father subconsciously?  That would make sense i suppose. He is controlling too. Not in a bad way- or in an abusive way. I suppose I would call it more of a   traditional   way. He is the head of the household, the   king  ,  and its normally his way or the highway. Even though I always got the last word when i lived at home. That got me in more trouble sometimes than what we were fighting about. Oh well, now we are perfect. I have always been Daddy's Little Girl and now he misses me to much to pick fights with me. I miss him too though. I call him almost every day at home or at work. I don't really miss my mom though. She is still bitter about my pledging AChiO, rather than her precious ADPi.   I'm a triple legacy, why would i want to go anywhere else?    I will tell you why, because those girls are NOT FOR ME!!!  I miss my dog most of all. My   Mollie girl   is so sad without me according to my sister. She said she doesn't play anymore, she won't lay on anyones lap- which she used to do all the time- and she just seems sad. I always knew I was her favorite. I hope I am writing about what I am supposed to be. The assignment did say to write what you were thinking about. And as I started writing all of this is just coming out of my head. The best thing about this assignment is that it seems to go by fast. I suppose i have a lot of things on my mind. There are a lot of things I would like to settle so they could be out of my mind. Like the money issue. I am so sick of money. I just balanced my checkbook and i don't have any. And basically that sucks. When all my friends just whip out Daddy's credit card for plane tickets to L. A. for the weekend and 1000 dollar TV's for their dorm, and a new outfit for every party or event, and good food at good restaurants, and basically everything else- it sucks to not be able to do that. My parents support me and i am very grateful for what i get, but the other way would be nice too. I respect my parents for how hard they work to support me. They don't want me to work and i know that I am expensive. College tuition, living/eating expenses, sorority dues, car payment, insurance, and everything else they pay for gets expensive. I just wish i could do more. I guess i am selfish for not getting a job even if they don't want me too. I say i want to help, but if i worked i would hate it and i would complain, and i would just want to go out all the time. I hope that grammer and punctuation, etc. doesn't count in this paper. I hate capitalizing   I   when i type fast. I am almost done. Done! ",0
1947,"I guess I should begin by saying I'm pretty tired today. I woke up feeling sort of sick. My throat hurt a little bit, and my body ached as well. The dorm rooms are really cold. I went to the financial aid office for some information but I don't even remember how to access what the lady told me to. I've been thinking a lot lately and worrying about school. I'm worried about this college algebra class I'm supposed to be getting into through ACC. They said they haven't received my transcript although I know it was sent from Houston on August 15, I even have the receipt. It pisses me off that ACC's records department is screwed up. This class is really important to me so that I can take my core classes next semester or so. Besides that stress, I've been stressed about Gabby. It doesn't really feel like we've been broken up. I know it's only been a week, but it doesn't feel like it to me. I think he is really more upset about it than me. My cell phone bill should be coming in the mail soon and I know my dad is going to kill me because it's going to be super expensive. The guy sitting next to me in this computer lab is typing super fast! He reminds me of the part on Meet the Parents"" where he is at the airport looking for a different flight and the clerk types really fast and finds nothing. Makes me smile. Tomorrow I think I'll go to ACC's records department. I mean, I have a receipt that says I sent the transcript, so I wonder what kind of run around they will give me this time. Last time they were extremely rude to me. I mean, I'm new to all this, especially to ACC. It's not like I knew they would lose my transcript. The computer lab down here in the basement of Jester is pretty hot. I don't feel an air-flow. Just still air, and the typing of the guy sitting next to me. He just left right now. I heard him talk on his cell phone a few minutes ago about getting something to eat, which sounds good to me right now. I had some oreo's while in class today, and my friend Gabriella was talking about how fat she is gotten, the girl is super skinny, not to mention in great shape because she runs 5 miles a day! But she was saying that oh my gosh oreo's are so fattening, yet she would kill for one. I offered her one, but she declined. I thought to myself oh my god! What is this girl thinking. All she talks about is what she eats and doesn't eat. It was kinda getting on my nerves, but oh well. I enjoyed the oreos and that's all that matters. I didn't feel guilty about eating them since I am probably going to go to the gym later on tonight. I wish I would have had some milk with those oreos though! New guy sitting next to me in computer lab. I hope he doesn't glance over and wonder what I'm doing. I guess I am pretty focused on my computer screen. I feel relaxed though. The chair is comfortable and my gum still has flavor. Still too hot though. I guess basements are supposed to be a little hot. Gabriella just left me a voice message that she was going to eat some dinner and if I wanted to go. I hope she doesn't find out I am writing about her! I know I've said nothing bad about her, but I think she could get her feelings hurt. She is a really sweet girl and I really don't have anything negative to write about her. Besides, I don't typically talk about people. I guess I always put myself in the other person's shoes. I wouldn't want people to talk about me! Don't know when I'm going to go home. I miss everyone, but I really like my freedom here. Coming and going as I please. Not having to be home at 12 and calling and checking in. I like being independent. Not that I resent anyone or anything from home, but I like being on my own and all. It feels cool and I feel all grown up! Valerie's phone just rang and she is trying to be real quiet! She is so cute! I'm glad she is up here with me because I really don't know what I would have done if she hadn't decided to come to school here. We're really close and I enjoy that. Whoa, I almost thought I lost all of my work because a window screen popped up about some debugging! Scary!         ",0
1861,"     So here I sit in my room just wondering about this asignment and and what it is I'm really thinking, well. I'm thinking of days that seem so far from where I am, the hope of the past I guess you could say. I'm wondering about the possiblitys of the future, I'm thinking about what a friend once asked me not to long ago,   what is your purpose for living?  . I told her I had none. That today I awoke for no other reason than the hope of tommarrow. This was a lie of course, I have purpose, a goal, just one that I am now comming to relize I can't reach. So what do I do?  I think thats what I'm think about most, what now. I'm also injoying a beautiful view outside my window of a world rolling by, sun shining, others walking by, and I wonder what story they have to tell. I need a cigeret. Hold on. God bless nicotine. It is wonderful drug. Many of my friends worry about me dieing because of it, but hey, what am I going to do today about it, nothing. I can fix it tommarrow, maybe thats the root of my bad timming, that always just wait for some other time. I'm considering what I should do about the Z delima, to go friday and just be in a state of medium pain, or to go do something else, something fun. God I hate her friends, and all there insocients and Nieveness, if thats a word. I really don't think I can handle there crap, and I deffinatly can't handle matt trying to be everyones friend, and the center of atention and honestly I don't know what to do. I'd like to go off on him tell him what I think of him and all his crap but I don't think it's my place, well not yet anyway. I need to go buy books. But I probly wait until tommarrow. hehe. Anyway. So there I was in the mists of a great opertunity and I didn't let it pass me by and yet I'm still here. Whats up with that. What is the point of endless philsphy of optimisum if nothing ever comes of it. A whole spewing of quotes just entered my mind, but I really don't feel like typing them. Ok. Now what. I see myself at a quite a problematic state in my life, no where to go, nothing to do,   never felt so alone, never felt so alive.  but then again. But there must be a way, a path, a right choice, but I just don't see it, no clear cut answer, well at least not one to my liking anyhow. A regular Kobi oshi Maro, no win sinerio. Well crap!   What to do. I have very few options at this point, go no go, wait see, leave, forget remember, give, take, sacrifice, avenge. What to do?  Well there is always another option, a path less taken. Away out. I just don't see it, I need to see it, need to free the mind of the wants and needs of myself, seperate, and ingage. What to do?  Ok, best case sinerio I don't do anything, just go with the flow, and most likly I'll get shit. I do something and things are only worse. I leave, and I make everyone pissed. Give and I hurt, take and I hurt others, forget. If I could forget I think I would, but you know, that really never works for me. I can hide, I can wait, but to forget, to let go. never been something I'm good at. I have gotten lots of advise, all of it the same, wait and see. but that just doesn't work for me, though there really is no other alternitive. So I go, I say hello, I leave. Thats what I'll do, and then, I'll go get drunk, always a good idea, yes. Ok so now what. I'm think of writting, but still feel really burnt out after the summer of writting, and all that crap. I really don't have anything to say either. I mean really what is there to say, I'm sad, I'm not at the top of my game. But that will all change, and I think that frustrates me. That there are no absolutes, that given time everything will not be as it is. Some thing will be, but there is always the possiblity for change, the question becomes what do I do to influence change, how do I minpulate the forces that are present in my own life, ussally I'm very good at that, but lately, I guess it's just to complex right now, no conret ansers to what and when and where, and how. But I see them in other peoples lives, maybe I've lost disipline, I let go for to long, and need to take up the  ",1
198,"I have a ton of things to do. I still need that book for MIS. I wonder  what Jon is doing?  He's probably waiting for me to call him back. Man,  I'm so happy matti called.

I can't  believe it actually feels cool in this house, it's always so hot in here. I hope you go downtown tonight I haven't been since school started. I'm always studying or I have to wake up so early. I can't believe I'm not  swearing as I write. It's kind of a natural thing for me but I'm holding  back in case who ever reads this gets offended. I think my mom's home I wonder what took her so long to get home. Usually she is always getting  home from work early. I wonder if I'm going to get a bad grade on this because I keep pressing return, but if I don't then I have to click the  arrow buttons and that takes to much time away from my typing. Man this is getting easier as I go, I thought I'd start typing and just go blank. Why  do people ask so many questions?  I guess I do and I just don't notice it. I keep thinking of different things while I'm typing. Days Of Our Lives  was so good the other day. Carrie slapping Sami was awesome I've been  waiting for the day for Austin to find out that Sami was lying. Lucas  doesn't even like her anymore for not telling him that will was his son. My neck is starting to hurt. I would hate to have a data entry job, that  would get so old. It's so crazy that I asked Danielle about Mariell today and they got in a fight just last weekend. I completely forgot about  Mariell until I saw her best friend the other day when we went tubing. Tubing was a blast I hope we do that again before it gets to cold. I was  drunk as a skunk. that food from El Mercado was good or maybe it tasted  good because I was drunk and super hungry. I wonder how many students from UT are online right now?  I bet a whole bunch. I like this new desk my  parents bought for me. It's so much nicer than what our computer use to sit on. I need to start exercising. I have a membership at world gym, and I pay $16. 22 a month and I never go. But if Jon didn't work at nights then I would make him go with me. I hate going by myself, because it's  so boring if you don't have some to talk to or if you don't have headphones. My headphones broke so I guess I'm just going to keep making excuses until I get my lazy but up and workout. Right? Right. Well I'm pretty sure it's  been 20 minutes so goodbye. ",1
561,"9 on the West Campus bus- please let me know if this will be a problem with the requirements of the assignment.  So what is this supposed to tell you?  Are all of my little Freudian hang-ups going to show themselves in my ""stream of consciousness"" writing?  ""There are no right or wrong answers""?  fine. I am constantly amazed by the blank looks on other peoples' faces when I pass them on the street or sit next to them on the bus-- are they really that dumb or do they just do an excellent job of faking it?  I sound like a big asshole, I know, but really, watching other people is my thing. lately, I guess they've just been frustrating me. I try to pick at least one person everyday and try to figure out as much as I can just by watching them. I'm probably way off base, and I don't presume to know everything about everyone just because I spend a while watching them scratch their heads and play with their hair on the bus never mind, I'm sick of this line of thought. I like to draw I play the clarinet and the piano I have a boyfriend named Zach and a dog named Simon-- sometimes they're similar  I wonder how flammable my dorm room is. I wonder how long it would take the chicks on my hall to realize someone is barbecuing in their room. the frat boys are having a shindig of some sort outside my room and I wonder what the significance of the word WOO is- they say it all the time. I used to think I was an alien and sometimes that comes back to me I used to think a lot of things because I had way too active an imagination when I was a kid-- this is something no one should combine with drug use and I figured that out pretty quick sometimes Zach really annoys the shit out of me-- if I'm an alien, so is he- just another galaxy he thinks I'm a bad driver and this just makes me want to cross big lanes of traffic and slam into a concrete wall just to prove what a bad driver really is. I also remember too much I don't like my fingernails much I wish I could play the guitar  I also wish I could make a perfect clay figure of my head so I'd know what it looks like to talk to me has it been twenty minutes? no. I'm looking at a screen full of garbage- how am I ever going to write a manifesto that will capture the imagination of the world and rocket me into super powerdom. if that's even a word. I do want to rule the world- a lot of people say that, but I really mean it my goal is to achieve greatness the only problem is that I have no idea how to even begin or what greatness even means to me I want to subsist on pomegranates entirely I have a really good relationship with my brother- he's really cool I had a dream that I could fly like a beetle I bet you don't even read this, do you?  so I could say that I want to kill the president or burn down the tower and it would go unnoticed?  I think the tower should be coated in Vaseline. ",1
685,"I am hoping that I will be able to keep up with my thoughts for twenty minutes. It is only 8:12 and I still have 20 minutes to go. I wonder if Jared is doing ok. I hope he ate. I was really happy to see him eat so much at lunch today. I hope I don't get in trouble for sitting with him in his cafeteria. Today was so hot. I am definatley wearing shorts tomorrow. But that shirt is dark red, I hope it won't absorb too much heat. I must have lost at least 10 lbs of water today. It is riduculous how bad my schedule is. One hour in class, the next three sitting somewhere. God, finding FAC is going to be my semester goal. I can't believe how hard it is to find that building. No one else has trouble finding it but me. Maybe I have some kind of direction learning disability. I wonder if I have missplelled any words. does misspell have a hyphen? My head hurts. I must be because I am tired. Maybe because I have had my hair pulled back all day. I hope I can find that building tomorrow before I go to class. I hope history isn't boring. With my luck it will be awful. An hour and a half contemplating how the Germans felt about this and that. Why did I sign up for that class. I am doing a pretty good job typing. I hope they didn't want this in a certain form. AOL is such a waste of money. I wonder if Jared got me into the draw. I hope so. I can't wait till the game on Saturday. It will be so much fun. I hope his roomate likes me. I felt weird today just sitting there. I need to make some friends. My head hurts so badly. I need to go to bed early tonight. I don't have to get up half as early tomorrow as I did today. I think we are going to have to find a better way of comunicating. I was almost in tears when I couldn't find him. I wonder if he was mad at me. I hope not. I wish he would show more interest in me. Hopefully it is just because school started today. I guess they call it class and not school. I really didn't feel overwhelmed today. I am so tired. Only ten more minutes. I feel like I am writing a letter. I wonder how Casey and Anh are doing. I haven't heard from Lauren in about four months. She can be ridiculous when she wants to be. I wonder if she thinks I moved? I hope she doesn't come here for college. i know I would have to be her room mate and everything I did would be reported to everybody and their brother. I wonder why I have been using ""everybody and their dog"" latley. Perhaps no one has heard and their brother, so I feel weird saying it. I was really amazed that I got that great spot in the garage today. I think it was the same one that I parked in last night. I felt really bad for using the elevator to go up one level, but my hip was hurting terribly. It better go away for tomorrow. I hope I didn't miss a class today. All these discussion classes are going to drive me insane. Life would be much easier if I had a decent schedule. i think she is going deaf. Between the two of them, my God. She has been edgy lately. There can't be much stress doing what she does. What would happen if she saw this. I wonder if she would get upset and yell. Probably. I can't wait till it gets cooler. Better yet, I can't wait till Christmas break. I wonder how many people at UT celebrate Christmas. I need to start shopping for presents. I need to wrap the gifts that I have. Caitlin's birthday is in A FEW DAYS. Where does the time go? I wonder if this rambling means I'm crazy? I wouldn't be surprised. I can stop now. ",1
2039,"Right now I am thinking about the point of this I guess maybe it does have some point but I really don't see one but anyhow its not that bad of an assignment I mean just typing what you are thinking for twenty minutes. my dorm room is rather hot and I want to get up to turn our fan on but I won't because then I would have to leave the computer and then I couldn't track my thoughts for those few second that I leave the computer. I waiting for a phone call from my boyfriend he was supposed to call around 9:45 but he has not called yet and its starting to irritate me I also notice that I have only been typing for like 2 minutes. I wonder what I'm going to be typing for 18 more minutes. gosh I have some much to do tonight I have to starch my army uniform and polish my boots and I have to finish retyping my rhetorical analysis paper that didn't get saved for some reason and then I have to do some biology reading and finsih some biology questions. I don't really like my biology class but I do like my chemistry class but that probably just because its easy and I've done well in it so far. my ear is starting to hurt . I hope I don't have an ear infection. I feel like I'm starting to get a headache maybe its because I'm tired or maybe because I'm hungry . or maybe because I'm dehydrated. I dunno but once this is over I think I'm going to take some advil and hopefully that will make it feel better this is hard forcing myself to write what I'm thinking of . I've been looking at a computer screen most of the day and my eyes are starting to hurt maybe that is why I have a headache . who knows . but I can't wait till I get to  go to sleep . so do you guys actually read these I bet these can get really interesting I mean if I had to read over 500 of these I'd probably be pretty bored. but maybe pysch guys just like reading random thoughts, hundreds of them . is it stimulating?  I'm dating a guy who a psych. major . he is in grad school right now . mastering in something pysch related . he is supposed to call me right now . maybe he got held up reading random stream of conscious stuff . my jaw is aching right now too . I have tmj and it sucks my jaw is out of alignment and it hurts really bad. I wish I could just pop it back in place but that would be all sorts of hard and probably fairly painful . but anyways and its only been like 12 minutes . this is crazy . after this I have to do some real writing that does not rock my world because I know that I'll be tired and I won't feel like doing it an then I'll tell myself that I'll sleep for like an hour and then wake up and finish what I need to do but it won't happen . gosh I'm so freaking tired and my ears are really starting to hurt but I think it might be from my jaw and that probably why I have a headache . gosh I really could go for a massage right about now but I don't want to spend any of my money . my boyfriend gives really good massages and he is supposed to call me but he has not called me yet . what a dick. ugh how much longer of this seriously twenty minutes . I doubt that this writing assignment, aside from a simple grade, really benefits me in anyway . so is this an assignment so you psych guys can have experiments and such? crazy so we pay money to take a class so we can do assignments for psych guys who use them as experiments . hmmm I don't know if I like that idea . but oh well because this assignment is a lot better than the next one that I will have to do . but this is making me so tired and my eyes are really starting to have a hard time focusing on the computer and then when I close them I want to keep them shut and just sleep for like a few seconds and then a few seconds more oh well I only have like a minute left count down . 59 58 57 56 55 54 53 52 51 5049484746454443424140393837363534333231302928272625242 ah nice its over  ",0
590,"I could talk about all the controversial issues that have swept the nation - Clinton's sex scandal, the terrorist bombings, or any other factor that is found on the news. I could also write about everything that is wrong with society, however these things almost seem too common in today's everyday conversations. What used to seem controversial is now somewhat the fad. People are running around with bad attitudes because they are the ""rebellious"" ones. It is truly not they that are rebellious. They are simply conforming to what is seen by the physical eye as rebellious. True rebellion is seen in writing. In the early years of the United States, people were hung and persecuted for their written work. I think that those moments should go down as some of the sadder times in our history. I think it was Hawthorne who was greatly criticized for his Scarlet Letter. He wrote about a woman who was punished for adultery, but was she really punished?  She had to wear an outward symbol of her sin, but I think that Hawthorn only included that to keep from being persecuted by authorities. The story was truly about the liberation Hester Prin found in her life. I don't think that is exactly what I was aiming at, but I am sure someone would understand. I like to think of myself as pretty well learned, however when I compare myself to others of greater intelligence I find myself utterly an idiot. While on the subject of intelligence I would like to take a minute to bash standardized tests. I do decently on them, however they in no way judge the full potential or caliber of any student. I feel as though there is something of importance that I could say, however seeing as I am the utter idiot, I find a rare occasion that I have anything interesting to say. I guess I would like to be a scientist in the sense of knowing knowledge for the sake of knowledge. I would like to soak up a lot of life while I have the chance but sometimes life gets in the way. I mean, sometimes I am trying so hard to enjoy life I forget that I am living it. There will never be another today. This is the only August 30, 1998 that I will ever experience. I would like to end it saying it was a day of my life well spent. ",1
519,"homework in the midst of my pre-cal assignment because my pre-cal is too long and really rather boring. plu, I need to catch up because I didn't start doing homework until the begiining of this week instead of doing a little each night, my mistake. I hope to finish this writting assignment, the pre-test, my pre-cal assignment and read some for astrology tomorrow. it's a lot but it will catch me up. then tomorrow I can begin my new pre-cal assignment and I can focus on my art project thurs and if necessary I can catch up on more psy. and pre-cal thursday evening. I'm also going to lunch with my frien james on thursday. james is a very good friend of mine and whenever I need to talk or unload my thoughts, james is excellent. plus, I'll put in a good couple of hours at my intern. david is going to teach me how to use my dad's camera and stuff so that sunday I can run another photo shoot and have some pictures developed. then, I'll have those pictures to play with and I plan on getting some of my negativesput on a cd disk so I can manipulate those pictures also. I have a very busy life going right now. I don't know how I cram it all in sometimes, but honestly, I like to have something to do at all times. I don't know why, I'm not very good at sitting still alone. only if I'm watching t. v. or something. I'll get my new job schedule on thurs. I just changed jobs because I was tired of working at the old one, that and I hadn't received a raise in a year. the sad thing is, I don't know if I'll be getting paid any more at this new place. as long as I don't take a pay cut I'll stay, I just need a new enviroment with new things to do. I'll be working at bath and body works, I think it'll be fun, because I like the things they sell there and I get to be the saleswomen. I enjoy selling things to people. my managers seem nice also. I might have to work at five in the morning a few times a year and I'm not looking forward to that at all. I've never done inventory before so I don't know what it involves, but I don't see the point in getting workers to the store at such an early hour if we'd be more productive a little later, even seven sounds more reasonable. I'd rather not worry about that until I know for sure that I'll be going in that early. I wonder what you're gather from all of my ramblings? five more minutes to go. I don't know how this is suppose to go, whather I should just write waht's on my mind or as if I'm talking to you at the other end. I gues in the end they're both going to get you the same stream of con. types of thoughts, huh?  I hope I can log onto the pre-test when I'm done with this, I tried it first and the server wouldn't let me on, yours or mine I don't know, I don't like computers much any how. I guess this was as good a way as any to put off the rest of my pre-cal since I'm being productive in the mean time. I could have gone and watched tv, or read my book (not some school assignment. ) well now, that wasn't hard at all, I guess I'm good at rambling. my time's up.  ",0
308,"So it's time for me to start writing this assignment and I'm really tired. I've been studying all day and my brain just can't take it     I've decided that the brain must be like a muscle in that if you don't work it out regularly it gets out of shape. Right new my brainÃ¯Â¿Â½s fat  fat. But that's OK. I've started running and through running I'm going to learn  more self discipline. It's really annoying the way the screen doesn't return automatically I wonder why the heck it doesn't do it. I guess it's some programming error  but surely it can't be hard to do. I've decided that running is just a conversation. One between your body and mind. Your body says ,""Hey I don't  feel very good can we please stop. "" And your mind says ""I know but we're almost there can you give a little more. Lately when I've been running I have been giving up before my body has too. This is further proof to me that my brain need conditioning. For the past year or 2 I have given up running for Aikido. I've decided to get back into running. Man this isn't very stream of consciousness. I wonder if anyone will ever read this. I seriously doubt it that's one big \ freaking class. But at least I know one pretty girl. Now that I think of it why the heck does this form ask for sex. I mean are they going to do some kind of statistical  analysis or something?  No way what could you do? count words? When I think of psy class I think mostly about the pretty girl I know in there. I'm helping her out with this computer stuff. I wonder if she has a boy friend. I wonder why I care. I sure don't need a girlfriend right now. This is the first  semester of my new life with my new major. Don't need no girly distractions. I about an hour I'm going to see a movie with my home crowd . /We're seeing swingers. I like it because it's a ""nice guy"" movie. with realistic camera shots. Wow it's already been twelve minutes. Over halfway there. Man I hope the research part of this course doesn't take up too much time. I think it out to be extra credit or something. Maybe they should defray the cost of the course or pay us or something I hate being a free guinea pig How the hell do you spell guinea. I 'm sick of paying fees toot this university. When I was at UNT I didn't have to pay sooo many hidden fees. They always lurking around the corner. Today was a pretty good day . Except for playing the stupid video game before starting this I have been very productive. I went to a habitat for humanity meeting. Maybe I'll start  doing that on Saturdays. I'm hesitant to commit though because this is my new and improved life. I hope my grades improve this semester or I'm just going to have to quit school or something. I'm kind of tired of school. I want to  get my hand on the real world and start making a difference. ItÃ¯Â¿Â½s amazing how much IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve been using the letter a and how terrible a typing job I have been doing. ,  ItÃ¯Â¿Â½s my roommates keyboard. ItÃ¯Â¿Â½s extra sensitive or something. I wonder why I keep cutting off the middle of words whenever I hit return . You'd think it would bee natural for me to hit return whenever I finish a word My fingers are cold. This room is 60 degrees. Man I wish they'd turn up the air. ",1
604,"I'm really behind in school work right now. I have been working so much that I have put school work aside. I have a lot of things to buy and not enough money for everything. I'm wondering if I really need to buy a mask for my scuba class. that means I would have to invest ninety bucks in a mask and at least twenty for the snorkel. another thing that makes me really mad is that I just bought those flip-flops today and somebody stole them. that makes me so mad, it's like nobody has any integrity anymore. I don't understand every time I find something in a store I always turn it in. that's  the way I would like for my things to handled if I left them. it just makes me mad. sure, they were on a super sale for ten bucks, but still, that is not the point. I wonder where my honey is at. oh yeah he had a flight meeting to attend. I wonder when he'll be back. it's already nine. okay, let's think, what do I have to do tonight. I have to finish up my economics homework, gosh I have to get at least a b in that class. I also have to get a good grade in this psych class. I wonder who's right outside, they sure are making a lot of noise. oh yeah, I have to do good in this class because I need it for my sequence to apply to the school. so I have to finish up this homework and then do eco. I'm glad I don't have to worry about digging up all the answers since I already found a bunch of them. I have to read for social work and I need to go and buy the sports package. I need to find out what time I have to be at work on Wednesday evening. I don't think my boss understands that my class doesn't let out until five and she wants me at work by five thirty, she's crazy. gee, I'm really thirsty. gosh, I have got to get back into homework. I have a test in sw on the 22. I have so much reading. I hate reading especially about research stuff. I think the only reason I'm caught up in psych is because most of the reading is pretty interesting and so is the prof. and economics, I guess I'm just afraid to fall behind in that class. so my goal for the evening   will be to get all this psych stuff done and economics and get through the chapter in social work. that shouldn't be too hard. I kind of like that Jason isn't home but I'm getting worried about him. if he were here then I probably wouldn't' be getting this done. on the other hand he has plenty of physics and calc to do also so I guess we'll both be getting school work taken care of tonight. I'm so excited that I'll get to go to one of the football games this year. at least I'll feel like a normal college student for a day. I wonder how that slip that I just bought fits. I have yet to try it on. I bet Jason will love it but he will just have to wait. gosh, I'm hungry. what did I eat today, oh yeah I ate Chinese. I really have to get in touch with bob.  I feel so bad that I haven't contacted him. I need to extend my condolences to his family. I bet his poor mother must be miserable without her husband. I don't know what I would ever do if I lost Jason, that's because we're not even married. ",0
2125,"hmmm. I was wondering what I was going to think when I was planning to do the assignment. well, I can hear that tv. married with children. I thought they were off the air. this place feels a little cold. its friday what am I going to do today?   sharon's or cullens place for sure. maybe downtown. hmmm. I have a paper to write my monday. I might want to get some sleep tonight and get a good start on it sat. its only two pages though. I better do a good job though. I have to read un redeemed captive this week to. I better thry and finish it sunday. I'm getting hungry. mexican food. taco C. hmmm. I might take a nap today. I want to work out today. I want to gain 10lbs before christmas. I need to work on my jump shot too. I miss playing ball everyday like I used to growing up. I'll go out to eat with eva at the texas club tonight then go play ball followed by working out. after that I'll be free for the rest of the night and be ready to party. I need to run a couple of miles to. I wondering how often you have to run in order to loose body fat. I wonder how long it would take me to get to 6%. 6 months? I'd have to eat right though. I wonder what it would take to walk on the Ut men's b-ball team. I guess I'd have to email someone and ask permission to play on the practice squad and go from there. hmmm. that would be great to work my way up there. if Drew could do it then I could do it . huge maybe but I'd have to commit myself. kinda like when I grew up playing everyday. I like this root beer. A&W never fails to make great drinks. Amys ice cream sounds good too. I wonder what my room mates are doing tonight. sean is probably staying home and doing nothing and cullen might be getting together with some of his friends from back in high school. I want to go to killeen this weekend but I have way to much work to knock out. I miss my lil brother jacob and sis caroline. I'll drive up there to see them as soon as possible. I wonder how my uncle joe is doing. I can't believe that him and emily are getting a divorce. they're only 30 and they have been married for 5 yrs and they seem right for each other. just goes to show what can happen to two people. you never know . dang that really bites because I hate to see my family break up. reminds me of my parents. and my dad. I wonder when the new lutheran service is. I need to get back into going to church. I belong there and I haven't found a church perfect for me in atx yet. I liked hyde baptist collegiate service. I'm not baptist though. anyways. I can't believe I'm going to be 21 in like 3 months. its more of a right of passage then anything. I still won't drink in public so its not that big of a deal but I always imagined 21 being in your 20s and a legal adult. I don't feel 21 though. that always seemed old to me. I don't think I have much time left on the writing assignment. hmmm. shrimp at the clubhouse tonight! I think I'm going to take  eva up on her offer and go with her and her family. ",0
1374,"Right now I'm feeling relieved that I was able to get here  the last couple of times I tried to get to this site the computer told me the site was unavailable. Very frustrating! I like this assignment, although I'm not sure why 20 minutes are necessary; it seems to me that 10 or even 5 minutes would do. I'm really not sure what to write next  I haven't done this kind of thing since seventh grade, when I was home schooled. It's weird how your mind goes blank sometimes. I still don't know what to write. My thoughts are mostly involved with UT, with classes and so forth. I like them, in general, but only one has been intellectually stimulating so far (no, I am not going to tell you which one!) I have great hopes for the rest, though  sometimes it takes a while for a class to get into gear. Don't know what to write. Don't know what to write. Feeling frustrated, I guess. I was afraid I wouldn't think of anything to write. It's not that I have a sluggish or inactive mind  quite the opposite, actually. It's just that sometimes I don't do well when I have to write it down. Which is strange, because I love to write. I keep a journal (which you, Prof. Pennebaker, would probably find interesting) and enjoy writing in it my gripes, hopes, fears, joys and other important stuff. Maybe I'm just not good at this kind of structured work. I'm lefthanded, Prof. P  does that have anything to do with it? I have a vivid imagination, and am inclined to daydream. Hey I just remembered, you said these were confidential. I can write anything I want! I don't feel any freer with that in mind, however. I'm stuck again. Still stuck. I wonder how many of my fellow classmates have the same trouble I do with this. Stuck. Now I'm thinking of the guy I like. (I'm not going to give his name, because I'm serious about him, and I'm not sure just exactly how confidential this really is. ) I wonder if you actually read any of these, just to see what kind of people are in your class. I know that if you really picked my brain you'd have some interesting stuff (interesting in a good way, of course!) This is a tumultuous and crazy time in my life, although most people would think it tame. My beliefs are undergoing an overhaul, and everything seems to be up in the air. That's not a good feeling, but it's never dull! I think in the last few months I've learned a lot about prejudice and tolerance, and I'm glad I'm learning what I am, even if it destroys my plans for perfect happiness (sarcasm there). What kind of a world is it where people who search for truth risk having everything they want taken away? This can't be right. But it's true, and there's no denying it. This makes me feel apprehensive and sad. I feel some anger at the world, and at God too. (Yes, Prof. Pennebaker, I believe there is a God!) But real religion requires immense amounts of faith, and I have to trust that everything will end up ok. Now I feel slightly reassured. If only everything weren't so uncertain! But do I really want a world where you know exactly what's going to happen next? What if you knew when bad things were going to happen, but were powerless to prevent any of them, because everything was predestined? It's possible that everything IS predestined, but that we don't know about it. Maybe you don't admit that as a possibility, Prof. P, but I do. Anyhow, I would much rather not know what's going to happen next in most cases. But in some, like who I'm going to marry, I can barely contain my curiosity. I guess that's due to a lack of satisfying relationships in my life, that I so strongly feel the need for another one. But whatever happens, I refuse to worry  if everything's predestined, I can't change it anyway, and if it is, then I can still change things for the better. ",0
59,"September 4, 1997      Well, here I go beginning my stream of consciousness. I really don't know  why I put the date up at top, just that I do that with everything, apologize if it offends you. Right now I am freaking out on my foot, which is almost killing me today. I swear I think I have the largest foot blister ever created currently on my foot and its not fun because I can't run, jog and it even hurts to walk on the thing. I have trouble putting on socks because the blasted  thing hurts so bad. I'm really beginning to wonder what I did to deserve that, I really don't think I've messed anyone up really bad lately. I've actually been kinda nice lately, which I usually am. Well, I guess nice unless you  consider what I did on Monday night. You see, some people keep calling up our dorm room and asking if its the Perry Castaneda library. I had been telling  them that it wasn't until I got sick of it. So some girl called on Monday and asked how long we were open. I told her we'd be open until 12:00 midnight  and that if she hurried she could catch us before we closed. I guess it was  kinda mean but I also thought it was really funny. Well, my hands are already starting to hurt me and that's not good because I have about fourteen minutes left. anyway, I'm starting to get hungry now but I still have more work to do so I figure I'll leave after I'm done with it all, which will take forever. Oooh, look at her, I guess I'm definitely going to have to move after I'm done here. Oh, by the way, I'm in the SMF at the library so I can be easily distracted while I'm doing this. I must confess I do that quite a bit, like the girl sitting next to me in class today, of course, I did listen to the lecture, but it was still kind of a distraction. Anyway, wondering what to type now to let you know  what's going on in my sick little head. Hey, you ever hear why ice is no longer  available at the Texas A&M cafeteria?     The senior who knew the recipe graduated. I have alot of questions like that. For instance, if you throw a cat out a window, does it become kitty litter?  If olive oil is made of olives,  what is  baby oil made of?    Why is abbreviation such a long word?   Why do they put Braille on ATM machines?  Speaking of blind, what about those signs that say, ""No Eye Seeing Dogs. ""  I mean, who's that sign for?  The blind man or the dog? At the special Olympics, do they have reserved spots for non-handicapped persons? How does the guy who drives the snow plow get to work?   Why do they sterilize needles for lethal injections?  Does a radioactive cat have 18 lives?  If you shoot a mime, should you use a silencer?   If Styrofoam packs everything, what do they pack Styrofoam in?  Why is it that you drive on Parkways and park on  driveways?  If nothing sticks to Teflon, how do they get Teflon to stick on the  pan?   If Alsups is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, why are there locks on the door?  Why is it that whenever you transport something by ship,  its called cargo and when you transport it by car, its called a shipment?  Why do they call it taking a dump when you're actually leaving something?  Anyway, those are the crazy things that go through my mind. Hopefully, I won't be classified as a loony and become subjected to further tests or something. Until next time. ",1
583,"I am very tired bc I have been studying all day for various classes. I know that once the ball starts rolling its going to be hell. This semester is somewhat full of crazy classes for me. I can't believe that I am having to take these evening classes I much rather have my 8:00 classes so that I could go to work and make some money now I don't what I am going to do. I guess become a male escort ha ha. I guess whatever pays the bills and gets me through college. Alsoo on my mind is the fact that I am kind of seeing 2 girls. I find them both very interesting and suitable for my needs. Neither of them are materialistic which is great bc right now I am broke all I have to offer is my heart. I don't know bc about 2 weeks ago I was pretty much dateless and desperate and now I am seeing these two girls and I have two others wanting to go out sometime. This sucks because they are all great girls and I don't want to hurt either of them. But I can see that something bad is going to happen bc it always does. It always happens this way for me one minute nothing and when I start dating somebody seriously I suddenly become attractive again. I am just going to go with it and not lead anybody on. Man once again this sucks!!!   what else am I thinking about GRADUATING. I am tired of the school life I want to be out in the so called real world trying to fend for myself. Then again what am I talking about I am in the real world littl help from the parents and paying all the bills with the itty bitty pay checks I get. If I didn't have conscience I would be out there on the street corner selling drugs bc this barley getting by isn't cutting it. No money horrible job and always pissed off bc of this. Why can't my parents be rich. I wonder what its like to have everything given to you and never having to work for it. I just want to know what its like not having to worry about how am I going to pay the bills. And day in and day out I see these kids on campus without a worry in their mind. But do they appreciate this or do they take it for granted?  One can only wonder but I would be willing to bet its all taken for granted. But I guess like my dad said ""son now your going to learn the value of a dollar and all those other kids handed everything will never appreciate anything they have. ""  Hes not a educated man by any means but I believe he is right on this matter. For that reason I keep on keepin on wanting to gradute wanting to please my parents and mainly wanting to please myself. Now that I have rambled on for 20 minutes I am signing off. ",1
809,"I am in the library trying to get my work done but I keep on thinking on what else o need to do. I hope I get adjusted to college life quicker so I will not be as stressed out as I am now. I am going home next weekend to see my family and all of my friends, I hope that they are all doing well. Some of my classes are pouring down on the homework and I am getting more worried as the days go by. tomorrow I have to essays due for one of my classes and I kind of do not understand them. I will be glas after I take my first tests and ace them all. Everybody was telling me that college will be hard if you get caught up in all of the other activities, so I am trying to stay focused on my studies rather than on extra things. I have been sleeping late and getting up early so I am tired for class but I have to force myself to stay awake and focus. After I am done writing this essay I have to start doing all of my other work so I can beat the deadlines and not wait until the last minute. When I get home I have to go to the gym and workout, orgainize my room and then cook myself some dinner. I have to watch what I eat or else I will put on weight and not be healthy. That will affect my studies and others. I hope that my family is doing well because I know that my mom is having a hard time letting me go to college because we were alone together for four years while my sisters were away at college. She already has a stressful life working 50 hours a week, driving home 45 minutes each day in traffic and then coming home and cooking for my sisters and me. I can just pray that she is not taking it to hard and will realize that this is something that I have to do. When I get out of college I hope to accomplish many of my goals that I have set for myself. Like having a great job that will pay me good money because of my great GPA, making a nice happy home with kids and a beautiful wife and doing anything that my family needs. I hope the relationship that I am in with this girl lasts for a lifetime because we are so good together and we love each other a lot. I am greatly attached to my girlfriend and I hope that I will be able to have her as my beautiful wife and have great children with her. I will see what happens through college and hopefully everything goes well. ",1
207,"hmmm, what should I write. This is so hard for me, but I think I'll make it work. That guy just signed on again, and I won't be surprised if he sends me an Instant Message. But I really don't want to talk to him. The refrigerator is making this humming noise that always bothers me, even when IÃ¯Â¿Â½m sleeping. I hope that my roommate sleeps over at trey's apartment because I don't want to hear her snore. There is somebody talking outside, I can hear them even way up here. I should turn off that light by my bed because if it burns too long everything gets too hot. The creaking of the walls here bother me too. and now some girl just ran down the hall. The airplanes can be really loud here because we are so high. I don't understand why people can't shut their doors quietly or push their chairs in without making so much noise. I wonder if anyone is going to call me in the middle of this. That would make me lose everything. Those people that call that person next door are really pretty stupid. They let the phone ring like fifteen times. In a small dorm room is that really necessary?  My typing has gotten so bad, I hate to capitalize. I should have sent that letter on Saturday, but I was just too lazy to bring it down there. Now it's going to have a weird date on the letter that doesn't match the postmark date on the envelop. I guess IÃ¯Â¿Â½m not the only one that does that though, so it's ok. My feet are cold. They are always so cold. and today the girl next door was complaining about how hot it was. I am never hot in this room. There is some humming coming from outside. I wonder if it is just a bus being idle right now. My computer just got more energy or something because it made some noise. People are walking in the hall now, I can here them. These walls must not have good insulation. There goes a loud car that was revved up too quickly. That doesn't make sense to me. I should wash my dishes. I wonder what my neighbors are talking about when they just said ""that's really bad. ""  my wrists are starting to hurt, I should probably change my hand position. I also should do my laundry. the rest of my laundry. I need to wash my towels. I wonder how long I would have to wait in line for the stuff. Probably too long, I think I will just wait till another day. That girl just coughed again. That makes me think that I should buy some cough drops. I am getting sleepy. I wish I wasn't so lazy. My eyes feel like their drooping. I wonder what the score is on the Cowboy game. I need to sit straight so that my back doesn't hurt. I wish I knew why my back hurts so much, I think it must have been that Sunday I helped dad. I really wish I had eaten something other than Burger King. I should have eaten Subway. I enjoy tuna subs better. I just yawned. I think I need stamina. My watch is digging into my are. I now have a whole impression of my watch in my arm. That kind of stuff annoys me. This watch is too little. It is made for little kids. I'm going to close my eyes while I type. I hope I don't mess up too many words. That would a bad think if it couldn't be read. I need to get a haircut, I want to get it styled, but IÃ¯Â¿Â½m scared that the way it will be done won't look good. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m taking off my watch now, it 's bothering me too much. why does my stapler have such a big crack down the middle of it  I wonder why the mail didn't come yesterday. that makes me so mad. I bet I would have had mail. this gum is tasting pretty gross but it tastes better than the burger. Yawn. now I have goosepimples. why am I so cold. I should probably put on a long shirt. why doesn't my camera rewind all the way. Maybe I should just get a new one. one of those advantage ones that I can take to Switzerland. that would be great for all the scenic pictures. Yawn. why do my eyes water so much when I yawn. that is very annoying. there goes the telephone again. I bet it will ring for a long time. nope it only rang once. I guess the girl is there now. my computer just froze up kinda, I bet I did something wrong, I am always doing something wrong. I wonder how fast I can type without making lots of mistakes. so far I am doing pretty good. why is it whenever you say that you get worse. ,  the second I said it, it got worse. now my wrists are really hurting. someone is going into their room, and the just slammed their door. that just bothers me so much.

1957,"I thought I was supposed to set a timer. So I set one, and now I don't think I need it. its actually getting on my nerves. Am I supposed to use correct grammar? I'm not using it at all. I'm typing like I do when I talk to my friends online. I like this song on delilah. I love delilah. why don't others? She seems to always make me in a better mood. Or is it because I like depressing music. I love depressing music and often times wander if it just makes things worse. Actually, I think it does, but sometimes u just have to cry and let things out. I think I cry a lot, but I'm not always depressed. I use to be depressed for a long time when one of my good friends totally ripped my heart out. adam is such a good guy. Do I really like him though? Or am I just wanting a guy to talk to and call my partner?  He treats me so well. Was jennifer thinking about me and adam when she talked to my dad tonight?  oh well, I'm out of high school so it shouldn't matter anymore. But it bothers me when people don't like me. I miss my best friend lauren. That song today really brought back memories. I love college! I'm pretty much caught up on my work and when I finish this, I'll be even closer to being caught up. There is A LOT of reading u have to do in college. Wow. I hope I don't get counted off for my bad grammar mistakes. I'm just so use to typing like this!  that's not good. I don't like this song right now I wish she would play some good songs! man my back is starting to hurt. oh well I have bout 13 minutes left of this. this really isn't bad at all. In fact, I think it's kind of interesting. What time is adam going to call? I wander if he is almost done with all his homework. I love my parents. I'm glad I talked to them tonight. I feel so refreshed and organized. college is awesome. I love all the people that are here. Many people thought I wouldn't like all the people, but I actually do!  I'm a big people person I guess. I don't know what else to think about. when is my roommate coming back in?  I probably should've went and watched that movie on clark field. Oh well. At least I read a chapter of psychology today. I have two more chapters to go and ill be caught up. I thought he was going to tell us when to read! I found out he didn't, and now I'm trying to catch up. I can't wait for my birthday. tomorrow is midnight rodeo! what am I going to wear? I have no idea. maybe I can borrow something from sarah. Do I dress up or not really?  I wander if oscar is going to come or if daniel is. How much is it to get in?  Well I have plenty of money after returning my book the other day. I'm so glad I got seventy dollars back today. what am I going to do with it?  I guess save it until I really need it. I think we need a lil more food in our room. I just don't feel like going to the store. Lauren had her car taken away, so we're probably going to have to find someone to take us!  Ok maybe delilah is about to play a good song. This is awesome! I can type without looking at the keyboard! I've always wanted to be able to do this, and my friend was so good at it. I wander how I am going to be creative with my lonestar application. I really really want to make the organization. If I don't I'll be so sad. oh my gosh! I love this song. sure I'll think about you now and then. haha. I was singing. we can do that right? Because I was really singing it in my head. oh man. now I'm starting to feel stupid. Oh well. I wander what other people wrote about. hmm. I wander if I'm doing this right?  ok I'm tired of sitting up straight. I'm so full. I think I need to stop eating so much! But I really do want to gain wait. why is it no one believes me when I say I don't like being so skinny? Skinny people always get teased. I want to weigh at least 115, and since I have come to college I weigh 2 pounds more. 107. ok my time is almost up. YAYYYY now all I have left to do is read and finish my application. Oh man. I have to get my shot tomorrow! ",1
819,"As I listen to this music I think about when I was younger, when I had a friend named Casey. But is she still my friend, or not?  What about Joanna, she thousands of miles away in Korea. I really don't know what I feel for her. I want to be with her, but I don't think as much as she does with me. I feel guilty, but what have I done to her, I have been there for her, drove her around, let her cry in my arms. I must sound shallow, maybe not, I really don't know. Is she the one, I really don't know how to answer this question. What happens next, if she moves back, then she will probably live with me. I don't know if I can handle that. I have started talking to Heather, she is very sweet, but is just someone to latch on to or is she really special. It started out harmless enough, but we have really started talking, and I really like her, as much as Joanna I really can't say, shouldn't I be worried more about school, I have astronomy homework due Friday. I feel like I can almost tell when Heather is going to call or come in. right now she is one of my best friends, in a world that is new to me. in fact since I have been here, the best friend I have had. Heather has a very sweet personality and a good understanding of people. much like many people I have met, good or bad I really can't say. sometimes I catch eyes with her and my heart takes a drop, a feeling that I haven't had in a long while. that really feels good, it opens you back up, makes you feel good, alive, a purpose. if I do break it off with joanna, what will happen, will that be a big mistake what if she is the one. how can break it off with someone who is in Korea, that is cruel, she hasn't done anything to me, I haven't done anything to her though. you get to a point where living life in a certain way or doing something in a certain way is just not right anymore. or doesn't seem right, being or I am really not with her, just doesn't seem right. but if I am not with her anymore will it not seem right in that respect also. this subject is really what I hide from in life, am a an asshole, or I am just telling the truth to myself, I mean after all the school saying or whateveris YE SHALL TELL THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE is the truth making me free or tearing me apart, I think I do love joanna, that is the bummer part, but to go into it with the scales tipped is just wrong, maybe I am wrong, I really don't know  ",0
785,"I don't really know how to start this. I'm not sure what I'm thinking. It's so hot and I'm so tired. I wish I could have watched the baseball game yesterday. People on the Emmy's give the stupidest speeches, I really like Noah Wiley. I wish I knew who a l;ot of the poeple who come up there are. I shouldn't have this on while I'm doing homework. I can't believe it took me so long to figure out Wilma Flinstone today at the picnic. I wish I had met more people and that the cute guy was there. It's 9:20, I need to go to bed early. I hope my alram wakes me up in the morning. I keep correcxting my spelling and I'm not supposed to do that. Those girls always play Dave Matthews, at least it's Dave Matthews. Maybe I should close the door. I think the people in the dorm think I work all the time. I hope the weird guys don't by to see Clare. I wish my room didn't look like this I'm so tired of it. two weeks into school and I'm tired of my room. twenty minutes is too long to do this. my watch ticks so lloud. I wish it would tsop, it's driving me crazy. Why is Clare's computer sneezing. The closest door is open, its bothering me. I should close the closet door and the otehr one. Why do we leave our door open so much. They tell you to lock it when you're in the room. We are going to be killed in our sleep actually we lock it in our sleep and leave it open when we're awake, so I don't think we'll be killed in our sleep. Clare's back. Clare's reading what I write. My concentration is broken. I can't do this, this is os hard. I don't think I'm thinking of anything original are thinking like I usually think because I know I'm supposed to be thinking. I wish frasier had won the emmy. What do I have this song on, I know I have it. this is do hard to do. I cna't think of anything when I'm supposed to be thinking of stuff. What cd, do I have this song on. I really wish that I could look and see what cd I have theat song on but I'm doing this and I still have ten minutes, no maybe 5 finutes left. I started at 9:17. I ahve five minutes to write what I'm thinking but all I'm thinking abbout is what to write, or what to think. Clare's killing her sheep. The one on her computerthat's sneezing. oh, I'm not supposed to do that, explain what I'm thinking. This is so ahrd. Who's that author who writes in stream of consiousness, I hated reading that book. what was that. james joyce. I wish my computer was faster. I really want a new one. buti don't want to ask. Clare says its faulkner. ",1
2297,"Today was pretty rough. My bio test was incredibly hard and I don't know yet what to think about that chemistry quiz I just took. I've got this spot on the top of my foot that is rubbed raw from my cheap flipflops. I'm really hungry. I wonder if we'll go out to eat tonight or just go to the cafeteria. I only have one class tomorrow, thank goodness. I need a break from school but I find it hard to concentrate on work. there's so much more to do around here. my roommate is never around but I don't mind because my suitemates are awesome. I don't know what to put in this thing. Tyler came to visit me for labor day. we're not 'together' but we're still really good friends. maybe sometime we will be but I don't want a serious relationship right now. Esp. not a long distance one. Tulsa isn't THAT far. But it's still a trek. Esp. since I don't have a car. I have to get a 3. 8 to even consider getting into med school. I hope that bio test didn't just screw me over. everyone's like ""oh it's only your first semester"" but I don't have time to screw up. my family doesn't accept failure. my parents were both brilliant and so is my older brother. I guess if I screw up it'll give the younger 5 kids a little breathing room. give them an opportunity to be 'average' and not feel bad about it. my main problem is procrastination. notice how I'm writing this 'paper' the day before it's due? not to say that I haven't had a lot going on. Because studying for that test was definitely important. 20 minutes is pretty long when you think about it. I can be on the phone for 2 hours straight with no problem, but just typing for 5 is already killing me. I hope psychology is one of my easier classes. I took it because it interests me and I needed some sort of break from my math and science courses. I've been really stressed and I eat junk all of the time. I think I'll go running tonight. but I've worn all of my Sophie shorts around the dorm so they're dirty. And I haven't done laundry yet. I've never done laundry before and it kind of freaks me out. my mom has been a stay-at-home-mom my whole life so she did all of the little things. pack my lunch, make after-school snacks, organize the family's schedule. it was pretty rough trying to organize everything when all 7 of us kids lived at home. But she always managed. as I earlier stated, she's brilliant. my dad works for shell. not like at the gas station or anything but downtown Houston. he does computer stuff. And that's the extent of my knowledge about his job except that he's an IT manager and yeah. veronica is making popcorn and it smells SO good. my blinds are closed so they leave streaks of light across my keyboard and monitor. It's annoying but peaceful at the same time. I have road rage. so I guess it's a good thing I don't drive around here. too many pedestrians and bad drivers. I'd probably get an ulcer or get shot for screaming at the wrong person. I want ice-cream. or pizza. we had McDonalds yesterday. Daron thinks their food is gross but I love it. Sarah and Meghan were going to do dancing sometime. I think this weekend?. So that'll be fun. I suck and dancing, but whatever. who really care? there's a quote I like ""those who care aren't important and those who are important don't care"". :) I love that. my other favorite quote is ""a life of love will have some thorns but a life without love will have no roses. "" that's helped me through relationships and crap- my sister Erica taught me that quote. she's cute. Looks just like me! ha just kidding. she's a senior in high school and it would be awesome if she came to UT next year but she wants to go to a small east-coast college or to a Mormon one in the Utah Idaho region. wherever she goes she'll be great. my older brother, Bryant, is serving a church mission in Italy but he'll be back at UT in 2 years. Kevin is probably one of the smarter of my brothers. he's in high school and wants to be an architect (sp?). then there's Kara. she made the volleyball team (7th grade) and I'm so proud of her. I tried out when I was her age and didn't make it. Because I sucked. And then I was too embarrassed to try out in 8th grade, which I regret. Steven just started middle school. I'm worried about him because he's such a little, sweet kid. he's completely sarcastic and hilarious, but you have to get to know him or he doesn't talk much. Shannon is the baby of the family and my mom said she's just like me. ha-ha poor kid. but she's loud and obnoxious and doesn't take crap from anyone. she's funny and flirty and has all kinds of friends at school. I used to be completely shy so I'm so proud of her for being the outgoing type. she picks up crude phrases from me and the older kids in the house, though, and so that's no good. I like my dorm. some of my friends stay in these crappy small dingy places and I don't understand why they'd pay for that crap. gross. plus community bathrooms freak me out so I love sharing the toilet/shower with just one other person. 2 more minutes on this thing. Gosh. I bit off my nails the other day and so now they hurt. Which doesn't help when I'm typing long papers for psychology. do grammar and punctuation and sentence structure really matter for this assignment? I sure hope not. I figure it's not English class and since I'm fairly good at keeping my grammar understandable, I should be fine. 10 seconds! that is all for now. adieu (sp?) adieu. Whatever. ",0
162,"Wow! I cant believe that Brian still hangs around here. That idea about the red churches in England is really outrageous. The queen will never go for it. Anyway it was random of me to have seen him. I havenÃ¯Â¿Â½t seen him since Joe played. Our power went out at the dorm and it really sucks. I waned to this assignment there but I obviously couldnÃ¯Â¿Â½t. The rain today was so random. It was sunny then light again. My dorm seems o be the only one that lost power though. This keyboard is sticky and I don't like it very much. I cant wait till the weekend. At least I donut have too much work to do immediately. Most of it is due Tuesday. That boy is sooo cute. I donut understand why all of the cute ones are jerks 99 percent of the time. Can we say Josh?  He totally ignored me at that party but he e-mailed Ilse for my number What's up with that? Jerk. I wish he would just make it easier on he both of us and just give me a call. Hello it's not that hard. I hope I meet some new guys soon cause these sure arenÃ¯Â¿Â½t doing the job, I wouldnÃ¯Â¿Â½t mind seeing Jordan again. He is sooooo hot. However I know that I could never have a good relationship with a boy like that. Shit, I couldnÃ¯Â¿Â½t even hold Steven's attention. Then again he's a jerk. Anyway, I wonder how the boys are doing in apartment life. I just donut see them all living out on their own. I wonder how James and Julie are doing at A&M ?  They should be coming down for a weekend soon enough. I guess Adi would call me if she's planning to come back any time soon. it is really convenient having been from here. I already know my way around and I know so many people. it is awesome. I cant believe my roommate was so loud last night when I was obviously trying to sleep. That is totally inconsiderate and she knows that I have an eight oÃ¯Â¿Â½clock. I'm never loud when I have to get up at seven in the freakin morning, I feel like I should be loud sometime just to get my point across,  I donut want to be rude to he though because I have to live with her a whole year and I might as well make the most of it Anyway my twenty minutes is over so I'm out.

1270,"Right now I am sitting in my dorm room and I just got off the Internet with my old boyfriend, Matt. He is still in Plano and I feel as if part of me is still there with him. The worst of it all is that he has a new life now and he is finding new people and new things to do. Since he is doing this he has found every way to make it very clear that I am not to be a part of this new life he is enjoying so much. Although there is no room for me in this life there is plenty of room for tons of other girls that understand what he is going through. I don't really think that it is fair for him to expect me to just sit here and let him make a new life for himself that I am not in, but he does not seem to understand that because the only circumstance he sees is that I am in college in Austin and that my life must be better than his so there is no need for me to be a part of his boring life in Plano. I pretty much do not think that Austin is that great and I would trade being in college to be with him in a heartbeat. I do not think that he is being fair, sympathetic or a good friend to me at all. He doesn't seem to understand that college is a scary thing and that it really helps to know that there is someone there for you that is a steady constant in your life during a time of constant change, such as this one. He just doesn't understand, and he just doesn't really care. All that he really cares about is that he is having a good time, which obviously cannot involve me. The only thing that he can ever see is that I am in college and that there is going to be so much distance between the two of us. The only thing that he seems to able to do about this is to put even more distance between the two of us. This really bothers me. And the worst of it is that I have been gone for a total of seven days and he has already found a way to replace the void I have left in his life. It makes me feel very wanted to know that I can be replaced in seven days. And the worst of it is that I totally want to be with him every moment of every day and he just doesn't want to be. I feel that if I were to come home for a weekend that he wouldn't even have the time to see me because he would be so busy with some other person. He doesn't even have the time to talk to me for five minutes yet he has time to go to bible study for three hours. He doesn't understand how unwelcoming that college is and how much I would like to have someone right now that really wants me to be there and that really cares about me. This whole situation is very difficult because we are so far apart and there is no way to see each other and there is no way to make him see how much I care about him or how much I really want to be a part of his life. And on top of all of my turmoil with him, I also had to go through rush this week and not get into a sorority. This all makes me feel very wanted and liked by others. So basically my first week of college has been pretty good. I am sick, I have all eight o'clock classes and I am not a morning person, I have been replaced in the life of one of the few people I have ever truly cared for, I have been cut by sororities even though all of the girls in my town have joined the houses of their choice, I live in a really tiny old dorm with a bunch of weird people, and I have broken the brand new portable telephone in my bedroom. Oh well, it can only get better form here, right?  ",1
526,"this is really weird. what am I doing here. what am I supposed to write about. who came up with  this assignment anyway. well whatever. ill just do it and ill get the credit and that's it. I wonder where nauman is right now. I called him but no answer. where could he be. I had fun this weekend. I think. well it was better then what I normally do, stay home and watch tv. I wonder what Woren and Sahara are up to. I don't spend anytime with  friends anymore. I want to go back to Dallas and see everyone. well I guess I can do that this weekend when I go back. its hot in here. its so hot everywhere. well actually I don't want to go back home this weekend. in a way I do, and in a way I don't. I feel like I'm keeping a journal. oh crap I think my contacts are about to pop out. see if I go home this weekend, then I will be giving up freedom. but if I don't go home this weekend then, my parents will be like why don't you want to come home?  do you like austin that much that you don't even want to come see your family anymore??  which of course is not true. I actually don't like austin. well it smells everywhere in austin. dobie smells, dobie garage smells, Wal-Mart smells, Foleys smells, everywhere, austin stinks, literally. I wonder how farzana and Carey are at Baylor. I'm glad they came down this weekend. otherwise I would have been bored off my butt. you can really count on family to be there for you when you need them. but sometimes it can be really annoying. like my mom, everyday, what did you do, did you go to class, did you eat, what did you eat. it gets on my nerves. but I love her. I guess I am kind of looking forward to going home. I mean I get to see all my friends again. and sabeen is going to Dartmouth so I can say bye to her to before I leave. but I think the hardest thing to do will be the transitions on Friday and Sunday. I'm here now and I want to stay here, not keeping moving again and again. I hate change. and then if I go home this weekend, then ill have to pack and say goodbye to everyone on Sunday, and I hate good-byes. they are so sad and then when I'm say bye, ill want to come back to Dallas, and ill hate austin even more. that's why I don't want to go back. this feels kind of good like typing all this. maybe ill start keeping a log or something so I can put all my thoughts in it. my hands are getting tried now. I never realized how long 20 mins really was. how much longer do I have?  8 more mins. great. where in the hell is Nauman?  what is he doing?? I'm going to call him after this and see if he's there now. he better be. I miss him. I wonder if he misses me too. I hope so. when is he coming back to austin. I could go see him this weekend, but we both know that's not going to work. his friends are all going home this weekend so he'll want to spend time with  them and his parents are out of town so I'm sure he'll want to go out with  them. but then what about me? What about unlimited weekends??? rrahhh. this is frustrating. I wonder if he is still in love with  him old girlfriend. I think he is. but whatever. I don't care. he can be in love with  him old girlfriend. who cares. I'm just going to let things happen. I mean that is the best way right. you can't make someone fall in love with  you. actually I myself don't know if I really like him. its weird. when I'm not with  him, I really want to be with him and when I'm with him, its just ok. I mean I do like spending time with  him, he's really funny and the time flies when where together, but its just not what I expect it to be. I guess it will just take time. ok 3 more mins. great. that wasn't that bad. I guess ill do the other assignment tomorrow since you can't do both on one day. I have so much to do today. that stupid BA 101 assignment is due today and I have to d the prestesting for psy, but the stupid WebPages isn't working for it. just my luck, since I want to use it, its not working. I wonder if I really have to read those 2 books for class tomorrow. if we do, I'm screwed. I wonder what Mona and charu look like. he talks about them all the time. I wonder if I met them, what they would think of me and what he has told them about me so far. where is he. let  me go call him right now!  should I email him?  Well if I could ever get my stupid email to work, I would. how come he doesn't email me?  oh yeah , wait he does doesn't he. I don't know how he emailed me when he was here. I mean I wouldn't have done it if I was him. I don't think at least. I mean he had a girlfriend and everything going. how did he do it? well whatever it was, I'm glad he did. ok good times up. ",0
1830,"     I just got done taking a shower in the hopes that it would wake me up so I could read the things I need to read for my classes. The shower sure did wake me up! A girl living on my floor, whom I have never seen before, took all the best shower, along with all the hot water. So it took me twice as long to take a shower, which made me mad. This anger added onto my frustration from my homework tonight. So now I am here, listening to music and writing my   stream of consciousness   because I figured that this would be the best time since I have multiple feelings in me right now. In addition to the anger from the shower incident and the frustration from the class homework assignments, my friend brought up a topic that made me recall past emotions. He recently is   taking a break   with his girlfriend, and he has been telling me that he is sad and lonely, but the break was mutual. I told him,   yeah, I know what you mean. I had to end things with a guy, but it was not mutual.  So instead of just acknowledging it and moving on, he asked questions about my relationship with this past guy. It took me a long time to forget the experiences dealing with him. Talking about them just made me a little sad. Like I said, the break was really bad, so bad that I felt like there was no one who could understand what I was going through, no one could help me because this was the way my life situation is and no one can fix it. Strict parents cannot be changed on their beliefs. Anyway, I tried to shrug the subject away by bringing up other topics, and soon enough we were laughing over some dumb internet site that he sent to me. If only I could help him out with his sadness, but I know time is all he needs to realize that this girl he's been with is not the only girl out there. A   break   from a relationship will either make the bond stronger, or one will come to the realization that a world of opportunity is out there. I am content that I have no one tying me down, but I do miss the boyfriend/girlfriend relationship. If I do meet someone, then that is fine. If I do not, then that is fine too. When I entered college I promised myself that I would make smart, sensible decisions and still have fun in the process. A huge group of guy friends is way better than one boyfriend in my opinion. I have not even met at least five new people in all of my classes for crying out loud!   There are plenty of fish in the sea.  Yes, college is great so far; I recently joined kung fu. It feels so good to be doing something you love again. I had to quit due to, once again, strict parents, but now that I'm back in the sport, the stress is less. I love watching it, and there are really athletic people in the class too. Martial arts has always been a big interest to me. To be one of the few girls in the kung fu class is another bonus. Not only am I surrounded by athletic guys, I also feel like I am special in a way, like I am unique. And I am better than most of the guys already. Flexiblity and grace is key in wu shu kung fu, and I've got them both. ",1
256,"okay IÃ¯Â¿Â½m writing this stream of consciousness things and it's 11:57 and god my roommate is sick as hell she's got this nasty head cold and I hope my typing isn't keeping her up god I wish people wouldn't pound their feet when they go up and down the stairs I wonder if my computer was a bad idea when I decided to place it right by the window oh god I think I am bothering my roommate she just sat up but now she's laying back down again I wonder if IÃ¯Â¿Â½ll get cold tonight with the fan on cause a cold fronts coming through I feel a little drainage in my throat I hope IÃ¯Â¿Â½m not catching my roommates cold oh god I hope tomorrow wont be boring or mundane god it's only 12:00 I never realized how hard it is to write for 20 minutes this mouse pointer is annoying me I want to move it but I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t want to stop writing thud somebody's making thud noises outside god that fan is loud oh I can't stop writing because if I did it would be unethical or shit my roommate just made a very weird snorting sound it must suck to have a nasty head cold your first week of school IÃ¯Â¿Â½m looking at my water bottle wishing we had an ozarka bottle in our dorm I was mildly planning on drawing up a petition with the other girls in order to get one I was also toying with the idea of creating a petition to get better food in the cafeteria or whatever god I can't wait to use the sorority koozie I got on bid day for some reason I don't like flashing around and advertising the fact that IÃ¯Â¿Â½m in a sorority, not that IÃ¯Â¿Â½m not proud of my sorority it's just that it seems such a confining statement to be making to the rest of the world who reads my T-shirt I mean IÃ¯Â¿Â½m no longer Lindsey (blank) but I am sorority girl and so many connotations accompany such a title so IÃ¯Â¿Â½d rather start a point 0 with people instead of increasing their preconceived notions of my personality because of my tee shirt god it's only 12:07 boy IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve never written so much bullshit in my life there goes my roomie again with her congested self I wonder if IÃ¯Â¿Â½ll be able to swing this college life I mean I want to do well so well so I can prove it to my mom that I can do it yet I want to party a lot I know that sounds real deep and profound anyway my back is starting to ache because I still havenÃ¯Â¿Â½t attached the back part to my computer chair b/c this task requires me to use some tool that I don't have in my possession at the moment so my computer chair kind of acts a rolling piano stool type dealie, speaking of computers I put this damn computer desk together with my own bare hands and boy am I proud it arrived in 4 foot 3 inch thick box of plywood and screws and it now stands a proud computer desk with a cd holding section, god my eyes are starting to get tired but I really have no reason to go to bed b/c I have no classes before 12 and IÃ¯Â¿Â½m not a morning person and I already have a hard enough time filling my days with things to do and I don't want to be too tired to party because IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve risen before 10:00 am. so I have many incentives to not go to bed and I feel like shit if I get more than 8 hours of sleep IÃ¯Â¿Â½m one of those always got to be busy people so I can't stand not having something to occupy my time even if it is sleeping late in the morning yet I feel like a slug if I sleep to late actually I feel guilty as if IÃ¯Â¿Â½m wasting my life and not prioritizing my time correctly god my left eye is tired and my nose keeps itching, IÃ¯Â¿Â½m so proud of myself that I am completing this assignment ahead of schedule at least it appears that IÃ¯Â¿Â½m off to a good start see I just can't fathom how some girls I know are already missing class, I mean what the hell else do you have to do here but occasionally study, party, and sleep so my belief is you might as well go to class since your paying for it and it makes a tremendous difference in your grade, but I shouldn't necessarily jump on a soap box because I never know how long I will remain this disciplined. kick ass it's 12:18 and IÃ¯Â¿Â½m signing off!

506,"So, far college life has been pretty cool. I really enjoy the freedom. I think I have a big problem with authority though. I'm terrified of the first test in each class. Especially psychology. Those people are experts on how to mess with students' minds and how to ask questions in order to trick you. I really don't think that there is all that much adjustment to college life. Basically I do the same things I did at home, except now I have to do my own laundry. But the bad thing is that I don't get to cook. I love to cook. I'm also really good at it. Inventing my own recipe gives me such a thrill. My parents say that's why I'm good/like chemistry. That's another thing. I'm really worried that being an engineer will be really hard. This semester my classes are not all that bad, but I still have a long way to go. Everyone says that engineering is the hardest field to go into, especially chemical engineering. I don't really have that much confidence in myself, and basically I just want to pass with Cs. Although I'd do anything to graduate in the Cum Laude. School is really the only thing that I've been better than average in. I don't even think I really excel in that!  There just always seems to be many others that are better than me. For once in my life I want to win something or be the best at something. But, I'm rushing for the Theta Tau fraternity. It is a professional engineering co-ed fraternity. I met some of the members today. They seem to be REALLY AWESOME!  I'm nervous that they won't like me though. They seemed to be interested in me today though. More so than the other people who were there. My boyfriend, whom I love dearly, is pledging the Phi Psi fraternity. I don't approve at all. He spends most of his time with these guys. NOT ONCE has he invited me to go to their parties/outings. HE always comes back telling me how they can't wait to meet me, and how other guys' girlfriends can't wait to meet me. I can't believe that other guys bring their girlfriends, but he doesn't bring me. I know he loves me, but I still feel left out. Most of the time, the activities really are only for the guys though. But on Thursday night they're having the pledge line thing. It's a semi-formal party. He HAS to bring a date, and coincidentally this will be the first time that I meet these guys. I really don't like fraternities or sororities. I hate everything they stand for. But I like Theta Tau because they are not superficial or big partiers and they rally care about engineering and finding a job in that field. These other Greek groups are more concerned with drinking and members of the opposite sex and smoking and conforming to a specific type of person. I DETEST smoking. Ever since my boyfriend began hanging out with these guys he's become a ""social smoker. ""  I have told him how I feel and asked that he at least not smoke when I'm around because I refuse to kiss anyone that tastes like smoke. Besides, I don't want him to turn into a smoker and have health problems. I care way too much about him. We've discussed the possibility of marriage-much later in life of course. He's really important to me and I'd do anything for him. That's why I hate the fraternity so much. I see the bad influences they have on him. He wants to go to medical school, and he MUST have the grades and the dedication in order to fulfill this goal. He certainly has the potential and I really don't want him to fail. But, I really need to learn to let others lead their lives. I know I can't boss everyone around. I know I'm very controlling and that I've really made some bad feelings between us, but I can't help it. I get a huge blinding and violent surge in me when I think about all that stuff. I hate it when people don't listen to me (usually I end up being right too). Well, that's 20 minutes.  ",1
1897,"Right now i feel as if i need to sleep. Well i at least need to start sleeping on a regular schedule. I have a severe problem with being nocturnal and then not wanting to to anything druing the day ohter than lay around. I think that i am starting to get a little better but i'm not quite sure if i will ever be able to have a good nights sleep. at night. I also and having an interesting time adjusting into school. i have been in school for a year sttraight and I think that i still have   senioritis.   I just don't have the drive to do anything, but i know that i need to get good grades.  I am enjoying my classes this fall much more than the ones that I had this summer. they are actually things that I am interested in and my proffessors are weird or mean like the ones that I had to deal with in the summer semester here. I absolutely love UT, i don't think that there is any way that I could have stayed at home much longer. I'm to the point now that it is really weird whenever i go home and i don't like it very much. I have even started to call austin home. This really bothers some of my friends, mainly the ones who still like back in keller or around keller. I miss my parents a lot and i fell bad that I dislike being at home. I love my mom so much and i worry about her because i know that she is sad. I love my dad too, he and my mom are my favorite people in the whole world and i don't know what i would ever do without them. I feel that i am a disappointment to them though. I am nothing like my sister and i don't have half the book smarts that she does. She got all the intelligence and i got all the common sense, which isnt good when you are going to a school like UT. I love my sister a lot, i just don't know if she likes me that much. We have always had to deal with a lot of sibling rivalry. and you would have thought that it had gotten better but it is just so hard for us to talk sometimes. i think that she is amazing though and i look up to her so much. Right now, I am rally worried about my friend, his dad died not long ago, and i don't know how he is doing. He drinks and smokes all the time and one of his roomates and i are really worried, but it hasnt reached the point where we can say anything to him yet. I think that he would get extremely deffensive especialy if his roomate said something. I really don't know if i can type for another ten minutes, i thought that this time would fly by, but it is actually going really slow. I also don't kow what it is you are expecting from this exercise because i am sure you get a lot of random responses. Anyways, my favorite thing to do in the whole world is Dance. I have been dancing since i was like three and i need to get back into in. Dancing is my utopia and it always makes me feel better. I love everything about it and i know that i need to start taking again before i completely lose the ability. But, it is just so hard to find the time and the money. I need a job if i am going to pay for it and i feel bad asking my mom and dad to pay for it because they are putting so much money into me going to school right now. Aside from my weird sleeping schedule, I also am really weird when it comes to eating. I don't think that I have an eating disorder, but i think that i have something wrong with my stomach that makes me gag, or go through times when i just don't get hungry and the thought of food makes me sick. I think that a lot of my friends worry about me though and think that i am either anorexic or buliemic. I do admit that i am very small, but not discustingly so. I have been living in my apartment for like two weeks now and i have yet to completely unpack my room, this is another example of me being entirely too worthless and having no drive to get up and do something. I know that i will unpack eventually, but i never really see the point. I do love it in my apartment though, my roomates are so cool, and they are really nice to me. I hope that they like me as much as i like them. i am sure that it is kind of weird for them though, like i am invading their territory because, they all knew each other before this and then i moved into the picture. I am going home this weekend for my   boyfriends   birthday. I miss him a lot and i wish that he would transfer to UT. I don't know what is going to happen if we continue fighting like we have been, plus, he just got into a frat, and i don't really like the idea of that too much. I have less than two minutes left and I have absolutely no clue of what to write. I think that after I am done with this I am going to go eat some lasagne. I have a huge craving for it right now for some reason. I think it is because it is five in the afternoon and all i have eaten is fruitloops. Hopefully no one actually reads these assignments because im sure the incessant ramblings of a college student can get kind of redundant and confusing. i know that i would not want that job.  ",1
2091,"Well I'm supposed to write and I don't really know what to say. I'm sitting in my room with my roommates while they listen to music and watch TV. I wasn't doing anything productive so I thought I'd get this writing assignment out of the way. Do typos matter? Because I keep erasing, but I don't think it really matters. Ok I left one in. So it's really hot in here. And my computer is way too far away from me and it kinda hurts to type. But oh well. I'm waiting for the cartoon Home Movies, to come on. I don't usually watch cartoons, but I saw this one once and it's really funny and I liked it a lot. Wow, only 3 minutes have gone by. I think I'm going to get pretty tired after 20 minutes. I'm so sick of studying. My roommate is talking about a little girl in a Missy Elliot video. What song is this? I have no idea. I'm hungry, but I can't eat and type at the same time. My side itches. hold on a second. Aw there we go. Much better. So I don't understand why I have so much work to do in my English class. It's ridiculous! It's making me so frustrated. My other classes give decent amounts of work to do, but that class is crazy! I have to read 22 chapters in Jane Eyre by Tuesday. Oh I like this song. Probably shouldn't listen to it too loud because I'm trying to type, but it's ok. I seem to be doing ok with it on so far. I'm really tired and I wish I could just go to sleep but I need to study some more before I do. I have to wake up early tomorrow and it really sucks. Wow, I complain a lot. I don't mean to, but I do. Ok. running out of things to say. Talk about smells. can't smell much. It's pretty plain-smelling in here if that makes sense. Damn! Only 8 minutes have passed! Twenty minutes feels like forever. We did a stream of consciousness paper in Creative Writing in high school and I remember how much my hand hurt while I was doing it. I need a massage. my neck and back are really sore. Maybe from sleeping on a too-small and uncomfortable couch last night. And from driving from College Station (no I wasn't at A&M) to San Antonio and then to Austin today. That could do it to you! Well I want a pretzel. They're sitting right next to me but I can't get them. When is this thing going to over with? I wonder what you learn from this? How weird and random people are? I think I'm a pretty random person. I used to say that word a lot in middle school. I hated middle school so much. I don't know why. It was just horrible for the most part. And high school wasn't much better. I like college a lot more than both already. Well my show should be coming on soon. I can't wait to watch it. I hope it's a funny episode! I always tell people how funny it is and then they watch the one episode that's NOT funny and think I'm stupid. Not that I care, but I want people to know that it's a really funny show. I need to be studying for English. No, not English, music. English just popped into my head. Hmm. Ok only 6 more minutes. I think I can handle this. Wow, it got quiet in here. And really really hot too! At first our A/C was broken and our room was 60 degrees, and we complained that it was too cold. And now they fixed it and it's soooooo hot in here. Katie just discovered Longhorn Delivery. I love that thing! I used to use it all the time when I used to come visit friends in Austin. We were all pretty lazy. I'm becoming less lazy here I think. I have to walk everywhere and can't really rely on other people to do things for me like at home. I want to go home and get some things and see my animals and my parents. I'm not homesick, but it'll be cool to see how things have changed since I left. My parents have been re-doing the house, probably out of boredom. I think it's cute that they're doing little projects together now. I hope they have fun living together alone again, like before they had me and brother. I've been warned it's almost 11:30 and HOme Movies will be on shortly! I'm excited. I think it's sad to get so excited about a cartoon, but you have to get excited about something! Well my time is almost up aND  I'm glad. Oops, I hit the caps lock for a little bit. Ok 10 seconds. And I'm done! ",1
2261,"I don't know why, but for some reason I am extremely nervous about this writing  assignment. It most likely won't even be read! Random, but I started thinking  about what an awful driver I am in Austin. All of the one way streets and stop  signs that people don't stop at are very overwhelming. I've already ran two red  lights. whoops. Since this writing assignment is online, I can't help but read the  instant messages that pop up while I'm typing. I love talking to people online, I  think I'm addicted. It really is a great way to keep in touch with friends and family  now that we are all living in different cities. Especially since two of my best friends  are still in high school and my younger sister is a freshman in high school, I can talk  to them all at the same time. It is very convenient. Since coming to college I have  become obsessed with downloading music from itunes. Tomorrow night the Sig  Eps are having an 80's theme party, so last night I spent about an hour  downloading hit songs from the 80's. My friends and I are going to have a pre- dance party in my dorm room. It will be awesome. Today my friend Melanie and I  went shopping at thrift stores to find 80's garb. I found the best 80's pumps for only  six dollars. Can you say jackpot?  I think my favorite 80's song right now has to be  Jessie's Girl by Rick Springstein. I wish I was Jessie's girl, because then I would  date his best friend. Speaking of dating, I think dating in college is going to be  rather difficult considering there are approximately 50 gorgeous girls on campus  to every one attractive guy. Not that looks are everything, but that is what  generally draws two people together to start talking. Actually I think that is usually  the case, but I am definitely drawn to the shy awkward boys as opposed to the  attractive hard asses. Racquetball is my new favorite sport. I have played five times since I've been  here. It's really the best work out. It's so much better than running for 20 minutes. just play racquetball for 45 minutes and you can't breath. It's such a great feeling. I have had a few complaints though, because I tend to accidentally hit the person I  am playing with a little too often than necessary. I've hit my sister like twice and I  couldn't even guess how many times I've hit Christy. Whoops! I love going to concerts. They are probably on my top 5 favorite things to do list,  along with snowboarding, eating, sleeping, and dancing. I wish we had some  snow nearby, but I would hate to live in the cold so I guess I don't really want snow  close by. I almost went to school in Boulder, Colorado but I realized I would have  to wear about 5 layers of clothing just to walk to class and I decided it just wasn't  worth it. I am a Texan, if I didn't break a sweat between classes I don't know what I  would do with myself. I can't wait to take trips over the holidays with my new  college friends. I have been looking forward to that for a ",0
1017,"Well what do I want to say I guess I should start by being pissed off that the girl I'm dating didn't call me last night after she said she would. we aren't committed or anything it just aggravates me when someone goes back on their word. well my brother's in town for the first time to see me we went to a good party last night, actually it was totally lame and it sucked that it was his first u. t. party. tonight will be so much better though cause the party tonight will be cool. phi Kappa Psi is where it's at. right now notre dame is barely beating purdue even though it's a two point game n. d. should run away. college has been cool so far and I like the fact that I automatically get credit for this assignment by just writing my thought down. that's pretty cool. my hardest class is my calculus class it's totally reeming me. i've never had a tutor before but he's my new best friend now. damn it's hot in here. the cafeteria should open right about now. i hope they have good food today lately they've be lacking the good food department. my roomate just doesn't understand. I really do believe he and I are do a good fist fight before it's all over. actually it won't be a good fight because I'll kill him. he's so loud and thinks that just because we're roommates we're automatically buddies for life. i think we could be friends maybe even good friends if he could. we'll how I don't know cause he gets on my nerves so much. oh well we're two different people from two different background. kid rock is awesome. especially on the mtv video awards. it's really hard to writes and sing at the same time. but I guess I can do that considering the fact that there aren't any wrong answers and I can write anything. i don't really miss home that much. maybe my family a little but austin is so cool. i just hope I can keep my grades up so I can stay in the fraternity. and I hope I have enough money to pay for all the dues. well my  time is almost up and I hungry as can be so I guess I'll go now. ?

812,"um I have never done this before. I guess I will think about my day today. I  went shopping with  friend. We went to a little store called oat willies it is  kind of a ""subculture"" store. it has been around for a long time. they sell all  kinds of hippy novelties- pipes, inscense, books about drugs, and probably drugs  too if you know the right people. anyways my friend bought some sunglasses then  as we were walking back a friend from highschool came running out of baskin  robbins to say hi. I don't know her very well but she seems really nice. then we  went into this vintage clothes store. they had a lot of really soft comfortable  looking t-shirts. We both tried on a couple. then the guy that worked there  accused us of stealing a shirt which was really weird cause niether of us really  had anything that we could have hidden a shirt in. he found this hanger on the  rack that didn't have a shirt on it so I guess one of his shirts was missing and  I feel bad for him but it was still kind of insulting to be wrongly accused. Oh  well no big deal for me I guess. so I bought one t-shirt for three dollars and  we left. maybe his lost shirt will turn up somewhere. next we went to another  little store that sells interesting odds and ends. Myfriend ended up buying a  bag that she really liked from nepal it was pretty cheap. then we went back to  her dorm room and hung out with her suite mates while we decorated her room. ok  I think it has been about 20 minutes I hope whoever has to read th ",0
2057,"I can't believe she did that. She is supposed to be my suitemate, and my friend. She knows that I like him, and I thought I could trust her with my secret thoughts on him. Why did she have to run off and tell him everything I've said in the past 3 weeks? What kind of friend is that? Did she think she was helping the situation? The question that I've been asking myself for the past few days is, how do you know when you can trust someone?        Why can't people mind their own business? In all of my years so far, growing up with gossiping girls hasn't always been easy, but I always knew how to keep a secret. If someone can't trust you with their secret, how do you expect to trust them with yours? There was this old saying my friends and I used to repeat in junior high, Secrets secrets are no fun, secrets are for everyone. Secrets secrets are no fun, unless you let me in on one!"" How true is that? I wish I could just take back everything I have said to her, knowing that she has run her mouth to the last person that needs to know my secrets. I can feel the tension between us building up slowly. When she asks me a question, I can hold back my answers because I still have some resentment towards her. Sometimes I even forget that I am supposed to be mad at her, and to make things worse, she doesn't know that I am mad at her. Mad isn't the correct word to describe my feelings; disappointed makes more sense. I met her through a mutual friend 2 years ago at a concert in Houston. I thought that would be the last time I would ever see her, and those 15 minutes of conversation with her are blurred now. When our mutual friend informed me that she was attending the same school as me, and living in the same dorm as me, I thought that we should be suitemates and try living together. At first, we hit it off surprisingly well, doing everything together. It was like we had been best friends since elementary school! We are even rushing the same sorority. Can anyone tell me they have been in my difficult situation before? Well if you have, please write a manual for me to read on how to deal with lying suitemates/friends that you thought you could trust. What bothers me the most is that she doesn't know that I know what she is been doing behind my back. Everytime I would make a comment about the guy I'm into, or hang out with him and come back to my room glowing, we would sit down and talk and gossip about it. Why didn't I see it coming? Why couldn't I have known that she would betray my trust and run along and tell that guy everything I have been gushing about? It doesn't make any sense to me, because I have higher expectations in a friend than that. I expect a friend to respect my secrets, my wishes, and my personal life that doesn't involve them. I guess it's partly my fault for not watching what I say around her, like talking about things that I wouldn't want to get back to him. I guess it's partly my fault also, for trusting in her too fast. My roommate has been very supportive of the whole thing. She told me to just watch what I say around her, and to not say anything that I wouldn't want ANYONE else to know. It just hurts my feelings that she would gain my trust and then knock it down quick to the start. Maybe I shouldn't be so open with people I barely know. Maybe I shouldn't feel guilty, because ultimately it was her screw-up. Right? ",1
20,"I miss the way my life used to be a little bit. Everyone else seems to be having a so much fun which is cool and really I'm not having a bad time at all, it's just I feel like I'm missing something in my life up here. I don't have all the close friends around me that I used to which is bothering me in a way. Things will be get better I know it, cuz this is the way I feel at the beginning of my life after a big change happens. I'm kinda irritated at Marissa I guess because she just has it easy with the new people she's met. She always meets boys cus she's so pretty and silly. She's a perfect little blonde. I love her really and I have a good time with her I'm just tired of feeling like she's luckier. I think I like John which is really annoying but it's not my fault he wrote that dumb e-mail. I feel somewhat satisfied that he realized he does like me but can't have me cus I have someone else in my life. This computer is annoying. I hate computers that aren't like the one I have at home and that I know. I miss being able to chat on-line to Amy and steph and everyone else. I wish I could go to Canada just for the hell of it. I'm probably not the girl he would be looking for. he seems like the buff good looking ty0pe that everyone knows. oh well. My stomach keeps making these nasty noises whish gets embarrassing in class. I'm worried about school work. I know that I just need to keep on top of things and I'll be less stressed out and stuff. I just n4ed to get up tomorrow , go to class, then come back and do my Latin and then some math or something . Then do my bio after Latin and go to the discussion. I'll go run those errands and make those phone calls. maybe marissa will do them with me so we can hang. if not I'll call christina or someone. I want to get involved with the Wesly group so I can feel I have somewhere else to belong. I'm getting down, I can tell. I don't know why I can't get pepped again. I guess I shouldn't have gone home this weeke4nd. it made me homesick when I got back. maybe I just need to call someone or talk to a friend. john later or maybe Liz. Brady would be ok too. poor Brady likes me and I feel confused about him. I need to write to shawna or maybe call her too. what a phone bill. I need that cellular if I want to call Liz lots. I hate typing cus I look at the keys a lot. my fingernail looks nasty. I remember that day still and how calm and quiet it was. I miss a lot of stuff. I need to stop being this way, get some sleep and then get up and go about my day. this weekend will be cool at the football game. I just need to be friendly and meet people and stuff. one more minute I guess till I can stop. well, I bet I can stop now.                           ",0
2334,"I am overwhelmed with lots of work. Yesterday was very productive, and I intend for today to be the same way. I have no history to work on but I have to work on some Latin and some astronomy and go to a help session. I need to call Andrew and see if he wants to go see Thomas in College Station this Sunday. I hope he wants to do that because I want to be here on Saturday so that I can watch the football game in Austin and spend time with Matthew and study Saturday. I need to eat some lunch soon but I have some things I need to get done before that. The lawn mower outside is very annoying, and I hate that there seems to never be a good time of the day for people to mow lawns. Last year they would start the mowers at 7 when I was sleeping and it bugged the hell out of me. There is a party on 6th tonight that I might go to but I am not sure of that, because I don't really like the group of people that are going. I don't want Matthew to go to that party in North Austin because he will end up staying there, and that makes me uncomfortable. This guy is going to Acc and his parents are going out of town so he is having a party. That sounds a little bit like high school to me. The people I have met from ACC just don't seem to have work ethic and I just don't understand how someone could not want to try their best to get far. I have noticed that there are many people at this school that don't think twice when they speak up, thoughts are never concluded when people begin to speak. There is too much individualism, people only want to listen to themselves talk. We live in a society where people are obsessed with themselves. I find that in history very few people make educated assumptions when reading literature. They pawn off what the professor says and act like it is their own words. I  love Bob Dylan, people always ask him what his lyrics mean and he always just says "" oh, their just words"". Its great, I love it. I need to call my mommy today cause she called me last night, I saw this dog on campus today with its owner and it made me miss Emma at home. I love that dog, she is so cute, I swear she has human tendencies. I just miss coming home this summer and coming home to a dog that is so happy to see you. I love dogs so much, I can't wait to be able to have my own. Aww, my computer has been making the most annoying sound in the world lately, and I can't stand it, it is just this sound that keeps on going, never gets worse or better, it just lulls, and drives me crazy. I hate this place so much sometimes. there is too much estrogen in this building, and the fact that guys are only allowed on the weekends kills me. Why can't my brother come up here during the week, I just don't get it. It is so old fashioned. I understand they want it to be a learning environment conducive to studying, but millions of college kids live in places where sexes can mingle and people make their grades. yesterday felt like my true beginning of the semester. I had a full day of academics. I started around 8 and didn't finish till around 12, and I went to sleep so exhausted that I had no trouble falling asleep. But, I wake up in the morning with my back so sore. I don't know if all this work is just stressing me and giving me pains in my body, I don't know. I just know it isn't' from working out, cause I haven't done that in a while. I am perfectly fine with my appearance at the moment, I haven't gained any weight in a long time, and I don't want to let myself. Last year I gained like 5 pounds and I hated myself for it, but luckily I lost it. I need to take more pics and get that battery charged, it is annoying that my dad has that charger. I wont go home until Texas v ou so I won't get it until then, damn. I really want the fall to come, where the days are always in the 60's and 70's it is such beautiful weather, and no humidity so my hair doesn't go crazy on me. Arg, I just need to pace myself today, I don't want to be doing work late tonight, I want to finish around 8 or something, that would be nice. ",1
439,"right now I feel like I'm kind of pressured to do this thing right because it's my first assignment for the class and I don't want to mess up. I hate that feeling where you think your doing something right but when you turn in the assignment in to the teacher they say that you did the assignment wrong. especially when you ask the teacher how long an assignment/paper suppose to be and they say they don't care but when you turn it in they tell you it's too short . well anyway I guess I'm getting off topic . I tend to do that a lot sometimes . Right now I'm feeling a bit hungry cause I only ate a small bit of food for breakfast (at 1:00pm that is ). Yes I feel very well rested too cause I slept till noon. speaking of food it reminds of this lady who works in the cafeteria at the place I'm staying at. I don't like her very much because she said something about me in front of my face to another worker in Spanish. she assumed that I didn't understand what I said but let me tell you---I didn't take five years of Spanish and not learn to understand the language. also I didn't work with Hispanic people and not learn how to pick up a few words here and there. so what really pissed me off was not what she said (which really wasn't that offensive at all) but the fact that she would say it in a language she thought I wouldn't understand and more importantly she did it while I was still there. oh here I go about things in the past. I know I should just learn to let little things like that go but I can harbor a lot of my emotions for a long time, but they do eventually go away. besides I'm glad that I can know whether or not what I feel is justifiable. never mind forget what I just said it doesn't make any sense. it's hard to explain. you know I wish I could type as fast as I think cause by the time I finish this sentence I've already thought up of something else. I think my mind thinks too fast I feel old. I've noticed that recently I've begun forgetting a lot of stuff. not important stuff but miniscule little information that I would normally remember . usually I could remember a lot of pointless things but now it takes a little while for me to. wow I wish I could write papers like this because the time just flies by. you know what I don't think I stuck with the topic. I mean it is kind of vague . I mean chances are if someone is sitting in front of a computer and you ask them to write about their feelings at that instant they're probably going to be a little apathetic at that moment unless your referring to what they've been feeling like through the date because if that is the case I guess I can elaborate. so far I've been kind of tense , worried that this assignment might be too boring to take the time to write I mean it is twenty minutes but I guess twenty minutes is too much. Also I was worried that the computer lab might be too full but it wasn't and then I was worried that I might be able to connect to the site because I was afraid that the site might be down (I've heard horror stories about it). I guess I worry too much but I consider more of an asset to my life more than a hindrance because the fear makes think of all the things that can go wrong so I plan ahead of time and think of the alternatives. I wish I could say the same of my little sister but it seems like he never thinks ahead and about the consequences of her actions oh well times about up now my only fear is that the submit button will work properly.

1057,"I'm not really sure exactly what to write. It seems very hard to me to just think naturally and turn those thoughts over to a piece of paper (or computer). What to write, what to write. I hope I don't get interrupted while I'm writing this paper. The computer makes a slightly weird humming noise. There are so many papers surrounding my computer. I wonder where the dark spots on the wall came from? It's hard to think of things to write, but I guess the purpose of this exercise is NOT to think what to write but to write what you think. That sounds very profound. I'm kind of proud of myself for thinking that last thought. Ouch. I wonder if this is going to feel like it took a long time. I need to work out, and I have to work tonight. I'm glad I'm quitting that job, and I hope the business starts to make money soon or I'm going to be broke. I don't really have many bills to pay, but I need to pay off my car. I wonder what Justin is going to get me. I don't think it will be jewelry. I hope he likes his present. I never get him as good of gifts as he gives me except for the VCR and Nintendo 64, but those still don't make up for everything he has bought. I guess it shouldn't matter because that's not a measure of our love, but it's nice to give and receive nice things. I wish my cold would go away. It would be nice to go to bed without having to take Nyquil first. I'm tired of being stuffed up, and I'd like to get back into working out since I'm feeling a little better. I'm just afraid that I won't feel better if I go work out while I'm sick. I haven't even done pushups in a week! I feel very fat, but it hasn't been that long since I've worked out. My muscle atrophies rather quickly. That's probably because I didn't row last year. I wish I could've done that, but the new coaches just sucked. I'm definitely going to get my own skull when I get older. I hope I will be very successful. I know I will be successful, but I want to make a lot of money! My wrist is beginning to hurt. I shouldn't be resting my wrists on the table in front of me. I learned that my freshmen year in high school in keyboarding class, but it's just easier. I guess I'm just being lazy. I feel like I'm forgetting something that I'm supposed to do tonight or tomorrow. I like this whole college thing. I don't have to worry so much because I have more time to do things. I just hope it's not going to be too hard. I don't know why I doubt myself. I've just heard so many times that the people who do well in high school struggle in college because they're used to high school, and high school is so much easier. I don't know! I like to fidget. I remember Mrs. Merkord telling us that people who fidget tend to lose weight more easily. I think that's possibly true. It's just hard for me to lose my legs because I inherited their shape and size from my mom. I wish they could just be thin. They aren't really fat, but they're muscular/big. That's just the way I feel because all of these Texas women have thin legs. They also have thick middles though, and I don't. That's horrible! I shouldn't be bad mouthing people even in my head. Not all Texas women are like that. It just seems to be a majority. My back hurts a little from walking around so much yesterday on campus with my purse and my book bag on my right shoulder. I'd switch, but it just feels awkward. I feel like I'm not thinking any specific thoughts right now. I'm just concentrating on writing. What was I just thinking? This exercise is kind of fun when you get going. I really was getting the hang of typing and thinking together just a little while ago. ",1
381,"I mean, really I do. Only draw back is it makes for fairly lousy formal papers. I really ought to put my desk together. Then I wouldn't have to type on the floor. Hey, a castle!  Groovy!  I'm not sure if this should be a dialogue with a nonexistant reader, but that's how I'm going to treat it. That's what my last regular stream of consciousness writing was. In 12th grade I took a theory of knowledge course for which we were supposed to keep a journal. At one point, I digressed on the memory of a goldfish which is about 3 seconds. Therefore, every time they swim around in their little bowls, they see a whole new world. Hence, Hey!  A castle! Groovey!  I've got to get my Relafin refilled.

I keep getting a java script alert when I try to do the pretesting, so I thought it might be my version of Netscape. So obviously, I decided to down load a newer version. That was about an hour and a half ago. I'm still downloading. ah, ethernet. Your sweet siren call beckons me away from independet living towards a dorm. Oh wait. I would NEVER get housing. No, I'm not bitter. No, UT didn't send back my housing application because I'd sent too much money. No I wasn't over 800 on the waiting list for housig. Grumble. Really, it doesn't bother me. Shoot. Another fifteen minutes. My brother's girlfriend is online. Back to my previous thought. I'm still not quite adjusted to being back in the US. First, I lose all energy and appetite every time I go outside. I don't deal well tith humidity and heat to begin with, and moving from six weeks of 60-70 degree weather straight into Austin in August, well, it's not pretty. Also, every once in a while I'm confused as to which side of the street the cars will be coming from. The one time I crossed the street right after I got back, I reached the middle of the road and was SO confused. Why does my neck hurt?!  For some reason, I don't feel a need to rip it off and set it on fire, but I'm definitly considering doind it to my hip. Hmm, someone else is online. I'm going to check. Nope, just the program making noise. I REALLY don't get along with this computer. I have a better relationship with my hip. Stupid computer. No,no, it's not the computer's fault. At least not entirely. I still haven't forgiven it for trying to tell me I had no modem. And preventing me from getting into Windows for a week. Oh. And fo not letting me run any DOS program written after 1988. Ooh Baby. Seven miutes. Bloody ""n"" key keeps sticking. Ah well. I wish I didn't have to type this. Writting or typing cannot keep up with my jumble of thoughts. In the time it took to write that sentence I flashed to my philosophy study groupo, and this sentence saw the thought about the Romans in Winchester. ""We don't like the river where it is. Okay, we'll just move it then. ""  I wonder how upset they were to not be able to build Hadrian's wall in a perfect straight line. Poor dears. I should not find the Romans amusing. Oh well. Hey!  A castle!  Groovey!  I'll type for another four minutes or so. My neck really hurts. I still don't want to set it on fire, though. Gee. all my sentences have ""I"" in them. We're certainly being egocentric this evening. Me, me, me. That was a joke. Poor and only for my benefit. All right. I'm finished with this exercise. Good night, so long, TTFN, and Cheers! ",0

I have to get up really early on Thursday to get my tickets to the game. Jeff and I will go to Target well maybe not. We will look at the magazine for a while or on the internet and see if we can find some games. Why the hell did I turn the fan on it is so cold. I don't know what to do for dinner maybe I will read before hand so that we can watch Highlander. I should ask Grace if she wants to eat with us. Damn only 4 minutes have gone by. That whistling noise needs to be fixed but I guess I'm already used to it. Mike I must call Mike about the DBZ movies. Maybe when I have some money duh. Why the hell did I bring that statuette. I could easily fit it in with my stuff. I want to be laying next to Maggie and want her to be with me all the time. This cell phone thing is going to be expensive. Good the light is still flashing.

It would suck not to have it the room would be colder than it already is. I probably need to wash my clothes soon I am running out in my drawers.

538,"I've been here for about three weeks now and its starting to feel a little more like home. I was really scared when I first left, and I questioned myself if I was really ready for this big of a step. Once I got here there was no turning back. I would feel like a failure if I had worked my way to this point and then chickened out. Being away taught me a little about love too. I always knew I loved my parents but that was mainly because it was pretty much understood. Now that we are separated  I know how much they really mean to me. It almost feels like I have lost them and I am thinking about all those things I wish I had said then. I guess that is a good aspect about college because it teaches you to appreciate the things you don't have anymore. Overall I really like it here. I like being responsible for myself and it almost feels like Austin is my home and not my family's. They will have to come to my city to visit me. I really miss my girlfriend Mandi. She is at A&M but she hates it there. She came to visit me here and fell in love with Austin. she is now planning to transfer here as soon as possible. That makes the future look very bright to me. She was the one person who was always there for me in the past year. I really think she is my guardian angel. She came into my life at a point where I was about to be headed downhill. I helped her in a lot of ways too. I am glad that she doesn't like it at A&M but I would rather her be happy than anything. She has called me countless times this semester balling. It frustrates me because there is nothing I can do for her. I just can't wait until we are back together here in Austin. That will be paradise. I can see myself living here for the rest of my life. It has a little bit of everything. If you want beauty, head for the hills,  if you want history, head for the Capitol, and Guadalupe is Texas' little piece of California. I am going back home to Tyler in two weeks. I don't think the town will seem the same. It already seems like the place that I spent my childhood but could never go back to and live. I guess it seems that way because I already know I am staying here for the summers in order to take some summer classes. My parents treat me like an adult now. I had one of the best conversations yet with my dad the first week of school when I was having a hard time. He really treated me like a man and that meant a lot to me. When I go back I plan to really show more respect than I used to. I'm starting to realize that my parents are not going to be around forever. I want to make them proud. ",1

I would much rather watch college that pro. I am downloading some music right now. I am ready for this paper to be done so that I can go and watch some football. I hope that this class isn't too hard. I don't want to really have to work really hard in this class since it is not really for my major. When I was walking to class today I was kinda regretting not dropping this class and signing up for something easier. But it will be ok, I'm just going to have to study. The other reason that I don't like that class is that I don't know anyone so everyday I come in a couple minutes before class starts and I sit down. And the only talking that I do is small-talk with someone that I don't know. That gets old after awhile, saying the same thing over and over again. IT's always what classes are you in and how's school going and where are you staying and where are you from and that kind of thing. It just gets really old. 20 minutes takes a long time when you are watching the clock. I am ready for the weekend to start. Football weekends are the best. This weekends tailgate is going to be a blast. There are going to trash arkansas fan walking by and yelling. This is getting old, because I'm am running out of ideas and my annoying roommate is making fun of me and I am about to fight him. He keeps on laughing at me and I don't like it. Here's my other roommate he is looking over my shoulder. He is not as much of a prick as the other one. I don't want to fight him right now. HE just walked out of the room. My other suitemate hasn't walked in yet. He probably won't. He is pretty weird. He sits in his room and plays video games most of the day. Other than that he just spaces out and watched tv. He doesn't party either. I feel sorry for him sometimes cause he mostly just sits in the room by himself when we are out doing stuff. I think he knows one person up here. But they don't really go out and that is no fun because I know that he is not having a good time up here. But maybe this is just the normal thing for him. He doesn't seem like he was a real social person in high school. I only have 4 minutes of typing left here so then I will be done and be happy. I'm listening to some new austin music right now. This paper is almost done, so I am happy. My friend just told me that his dad drinks o'douls, that would not be fun. My dad drinks real beer. Now my paper is done. ",1

I always look for different things. like the outside world. there are some things you just can't reveal. sometimes there are no answers to questions and no questions  can answer. I can't write. I would like to be a screenwriter someday but I can not write complete  thoughts. I am really scatterbrained. I have many ideas but I am afraid that I will fail listen. I always have a ear that listens to weird noises, give me an apple. I would like to eatan apple tonight. tonight is a good a good night. tonight will be never  the same again. there will always be room to live in another night. I hope I can learn how to type faster cause I have many strange and honest thoughts  running through my mind tonight. I will think of why I am writing this. I don't want to think about it cause it will take up too much of my other  ideas. I like to read why people are the way they are. I think every bodyÃ¯Â¿Â½s brain I s incredibly strange. infinity is a concept that cloud not be conceived not in this brain, or anybody elseÃ¯Â¿Â½s. some day will the word mean something or will it? that I can not explain or will try to explain or think like I know I can explain.

I am almost certain that I know what I want to do but  I am afraid of failing and never be able to be happy. I do have confidence, ambition and ] think that I will be successful.

1501,"Hello, I am so stressed right now with school. I am swamped with things to do. I don't even know where to begin I have so much. I am trying to get everything done because I am going home this weekend I don't want a lot to do. This is the first time for me to be home since I have been in college. I am really excited. I cannot wait to get away from everything. I wish I could have one day where I didn't have to do anything. I want to workout but I don't even have the time to do that. I don't see how people have jobs or be in a sorority or fraternity in school. I barely get everything done and I am not in them. They do stuff together almost every single night. I can't think of anything else right now except about what I have to do. I cannot wait until the Texas and A&M game, it is going to be so much fun. I also cannot wait to see my family. I think I am a little home sick. I think I keep pushing the submit button when I am writing I hope that's okay. I don't mean to do that, but my laptop is messed up or something. Anyway, I have been so busy that I haven't had time to call my friends or family. I have friends that go to this school but I never see them and hardly hear from them. I am so glad that I got a ticket to the OU game because I am one of the very few who doesn't have to wait in line. This reminds me of an assignment we had to do in high school. It was called power writing and we would have to write for two minutes about a topic and whoever had the most words at the very end won a prize. I was always the winner. People in the class would try to beat me and they never could. I guess I am just a fast writer. I really hope that it is okay that I pushed the submit button. It was an accident. I just figured out why that was happening and I think I fixed it. Just disregard the unfinished versions of this. I can't believe that I still have more than five minutes to keep typing. After this I still have so much to do tonight. I can't wait until this weekend so I can shopping and wash my car, but I still have to write a paper sometime during this break. also want to go out to eat while I am there. I haven't done that in a while. I accidentally pushed that button again I hope that it is okay. Anyway I am so tired and I really want to take a nap. I haven't gotten much sleep lately although I got more than I ever did in high school. In high school I got less sleep and did more physical work than I do now. I think my time is already up. ",0
1763,"        Lately, I have been having all sorts of feelings. All my life I have lived in San Antonio, TX and now moving to Austin feels so different. I feel so lonely because I barely have any friends in Austin and I am to shy to approach people. Hopefully my year will get better. I don't think that my roomate is too fond of me. I don't understand why she barely talks to me? I try to be friendly. All I do all day is read or call my friends back in San Antonio so that I don't feel lonely. It's odd really that I talk to my mom quite often on the phone.    On top of that I have problems with my boyfriend. I don't know what's wrong with me, but I am having serious trust issuses. I have been with him for four years and I should be able to trust him, but he lives so far away and i don't get to see him much. How do I know if he's doing any thing behind my back? Should I even think like this? Does he trust me? I really do love him. Only recently did I discover that I love him. I wonder if the two of us will ever be together in the future. I really hate my culture when it comes to this kind of stuff. Why do we have to have arranged marriages? What is the point in that?       I hope I do well in school this year. Last year I got good grades, but i really want to make my parent sproud. I feel bad fo rthem really. They pay so much money for my education and living. I feel as though I owe it to them to make them proud after all that they do for me. I really should get a job, but my schedule really doesn't allow me to. I'm not done with class till 5 everyday and I start the day as early as 8. Hopefully next year my schedule will be better and I can get a job and take on some responsibilities for myself.    Living away from home is so different. It's strange really. I didn't think that I would miss home so much. I was so glad to finally leave and be on my own and have freedom. I don't even know where anything is in Austin and I hate bothering the people that I do know in Austin for directions. I don't know if it bothers them that I keep calling.     Maybe I should join a sorority or something so that I can meet more people. I wonder if I can even handle being in a sorority with school work though.      I can't believe I actually decided to change my major. From computer science to nursing, wow that's a big change. Well all I know is that I want to do something dealing with kids because I love kids and they usually love me. I don't want to be a teacher and not a doctor because that is way to much schooling for me. I think being a pediatric nurse will give me the oppurtunity to interact with children and help them. If only my mom would be happy with the decision I made. I don't know what her problem is anyways. It's my life, I should be able to do what I want and what make me happy.     To tell you the truth about what i am thinking at the moment right now, I am really scared about this writing assignment my hands are shaking and I have no idea why. It should be easy for me like writing in my diary . I guess it's because of the fact that I am going to be graded on it. O well, hopefully I do well.     I'm really tired and my back is hurting me and my time is almost up, so goodbye i'm going to sleep.           ",1
1272,"I am really quite flustered right now, because I already wrote this assignment earlier, and the philosophy systems were probably down, and now I cannot retrieve the file from where I saved it. Anyways, hardly makes a difference though. I can't help wondering about the purpose of this assignment. I mean, the teacher hardly even knows me, and probably cannot even relate to what I am thinking about. I guess this must be a way of doing research, and we'll eventually learn about it. I wish all assignments were just as simple. But its difficult to suddenly get used to this American system of education. This does get strange and intimidating sometimes, with large classrooms and lack of onetoone interaction. But it is nice, and I will definitely get used to it. Today is Monday, and a whole new week lies ahead. I quite dread Monday mornings. not because I have to go to class, but because I have a slight fear of the unknown. what if I have forgotten to do an assignment, what if I annoy a teacher! I am really hungry. I had a small lunch last night. Cafeterias were closed so I made some sandwiches at home. I wish I had a car. Then I could go out anywhere and eat at anytime. I could even go to Sixth Street. I want to buy a sports car. I will buy an Italian sports car once I earn my own million dollars! But that's a long way to go. I want to eat at Kinsolving dining hall today. I am quite tired with the food at Jester. But its pretty far from Jester, and I hate to walk. I guess I'll eat in Jester itself. I wonder what my friends back home must be doing, especially Tanaya. I hope they miss me as much as I miss them. I can't wait to go back to India, but I don't think I'll get to go before summer. I bump into them online almost everyday, so I do feel quite close. But personal meetings are totally different things. My room is such a mess. I will have to clean it up. will do it on Thursday. Thursdays are wonderful. I have only one class, so I do all other work on Thursdays. But this is not a good habit. I eventually end up putting off all my important work to Thursdays, and then run out of time on Thursdays even! I wish the weekend were longer. I need my own computer. I'll get one soon. I hope I get a good deal though. Then I wont have to go to the lab each time I have to do an assignment. My uncle is Dallas said he could get me one for a decent price. I will probably go meet him next week if it fits in my schedule. Great, my 20 minutes are almost up. This assignment was fun. I hope that all the others are as much fun to do. ",1
1194,"I woke up this morning and my words from last night at 1am, ""Can I have a 6 piece chicken tender and small fries to go"" echoed in my ears. I felt guilty. Within five minutes of ordering I had scarfed down the whole thing. Although my body wasn't hungry, I was thinking about food and I started to have major cravings for something filling. I sent myself on a mission to quench my thoughts, not my stomach. Is it normal to eat when you think about food and your body isn't hungry? Does thinking about food imply that you really are hungry even though your stomach isn't growling? This also brings up the issue of will power. I usually have strong will power, but with food it is another story. My body feels weighted down by guilt today. I went to Tops the other day to look at pictures and I looked fat in all the pictures I saw of myself. I'm sure every freshman promises themselves that they won't gain the dreaded ""freshman fifteen. "" I refuse to believe that it is an inevitable event in my life right now. I know how to avoid gaining the weight; exercise, eat healthy food, and above all, don't have late night snacks. My will power crumbles late at night when I see food or if my belly doesn't have that full feeling. Getting out of bed I could feel the unused calories building up in my body. I didn't eat breakfast and went to the gym where I worked out for almost two hours today in hopes of burning off last night's calorie fest and hopefully today's too. When I returned to my room I was in a bad mood, felt very lonely and as I told my mom, ""I'm not feeling like myself. "" I was depressed. I only felt good about myself today when I was exercising. I wanted to go eat lunch, but I felt guilty about even thinking about eating. I love to eat. It brings me satisfaction, comfort, and pleasure. However, my body image tampers with my enjoyment. I am not over weight but I feel like it. As strong, smart, and confident as I am about myself and who I am, I have been sucked into the belief that I ought to be skinny. It is amazing how easily my mood depends on my eating habits. ",1
1662,"     Well i just got back from Houston, where i live. It was weird going back. Kind of like this isn't my home anymore, even though Austin isn't my home. It's just my temporary home. It's weird though seeing my parents, knowing that I won't see them for a long time. It was good to see them again. I hope I'm not going to make myself too crazy up here with school. School is my number one priority. I want to have a good life after this, i don't want to end up in a job i hate. Hopefully i figure out what i want to do with my life. I don't know if i want to teach, or work for a record label, or write for the rest of my life, or do something with crime scene investigation. I think being a criminal psycologist would be a lot of fun. I bet it would never get boring! I just hope I'm not getting in over my head with this class. I've always been interested in psycology, and how people act and why, and what causes it, but I'm afraid i will be over my head. Hopefully not. It seems like it will be very intersting despite the hard work I know will come. It's very strange being in a class that's so huge! I'm used to being in classes with no more than 30 people. I guess all freshmen are though. I still feel like I'm kind of out of place sometimes here. Luckily I've been making friends with the people on my floor. Everyone here seems really cool. There are a few girls down the hall that are soo cool! I could see myself being friends with them for awhile. I hope so at least! Everyone here seems very nice and friendly. (At least the people on my half of the floor does. ) The other side seems very anti-social. We all have our doors open on this side of the floor, but I never see any of their doors open down the hall. It's strange, but i don't really miss many of my friends. I don't think this makes me a bad friend, I just think i was ready to separate from them. Some of them at least. But I thought I was going to miss some of them SO much, but in reality, I don't miss many of them. Especially some of the friends I was supposedly   best friends   with. I sometimes wonder if I'm missed. I wonder if I was as good of a friend as i thought I was. I don't know. One of the girls down the floor just got back frlom out of town. She's one of the girls i think i could be good friends with for awhile after this year. She's a lot like me! Surprisingly. It's hard to find people who don't really drink, and have more fun just hanging out, and going bowling, or going to the movies, instead of going to a frat, or a big party. It's cool though that she's like that. It's nice to find someone who likes the same things you do, especially when they're so uncommon around college kids! I've only been back for a few hours, and I don't miss my parents! I thought i would miss them more. I think this means I'm grown up now! haha, grown up. That's weird to think. I don't feel like I'm grown up. I still feel like the same old nerd from Houston. haha. I finally threw my flowers out that were sent to me, and washed the vase. They were starting to smell a little funky. Danielle, my roommate just got back from the grocery store. I hope she bought good food! hehe. The food here is pretty good though, surprisingly. Not like home, but good enough to eat. Some of it is really good though, you just have to pick the right things is all. I could talk about food all day! haha. I can't wait to watch Sex and the City tonight with some girs from the floor. Since we don't get HBO here my mom taped the last 2 episodes and I brought them abck for all of us poor girls with no HBO! Hopefully Emily gets back from dropping her boyfriend off at SW in not too long. I have an early class in the morning, and i don't want to miss it. Especially since it's a class of 14 people, it would be hard to go unnoticed. I think it will be a fun class. It's Jazz and Literature. I love listening to jazz, but there's going to be a lot of writing and reading. Hopefully the writing will be fun. I love creative writing and writing like this, just writing whatever comes to my head. But essays and stuff aren't that fun. I don't know anyone who likes writing them though. My rhetoric class is going to be a lot of that not fun writing though. Yuck. Oh well it's a class I have to take. Hopefully I'll enjoy it though. Otherwise it's going to be hard to drag myself to the class every Tuesday and Thursday. ",1
1697,"     I just got home from my boyfriends house. He is so wonderful. We have so much in common. I love him so much. He is a Christian and so am I. When we spend time together i feel like i am on top of the world just as happy as could be. That is how i am feeling right now that is why i am writing about him. I think about him all the time. When we are not together i wish we were. i can never be without him and not be missing him. He is just so funny, hes so cute, hes so wonderful. I wish he were here with me right now. He is caring and loving and we have a great time when we are together from when we are kissing to hugging to playing board games with his family. When i came home from his house i was going to try to send a card to my friend for his birthday, but when i was looking online for cards to send i was beginning to get frustrated that i could not find any that i liked so i started looking at other cards like pictures of cute babies that people had sent. I love to be around children and they seem to like me too. I hope to have some of my own one day. but that will be after college. I want to wait til I am married, that is very important to me. Even though sometimes i have to admit it is not easy. Me and my boyfriend have talked about getting married one day. I really wish he was here right now. but hes at the store with his mom shopping because she does not feel very well right now. I love his family so much. His parents are 2 of the most awesome christian people and the cutest couple you will ever meet. If me and my boyfreind do get married i want to be just like them. They have been married like 20 something years and are still completely in love with eachother like they had just started thier relationship togehter. YOu can see in in how they look at eachother how they talk to eachother just eerything about them. Davids sisters are amazing too. They are truely a lot of fun.  They are 28 and almost 31 years old. So they are quite a bit older than he is. Whenever i go over to his house they always joke around with us talking about inlaws and stuff like that. I think they think we will get married some day too. I hope we do. When i first started dating him even within the first couple of weeks I could already sit in his house and picture bringing the kids over to the grandparents house. His parents would make awesome grandparents too. They are also really good with kids. His sisters would be really fun aunts too. His middle sister Amy is getting married in december or january when her fiance gets back from Germany with the VISA. Hes really cool too. I just got really happy because my boyfreind just sent me a message saying he was home but i had to say be right back so i could write more about him. He is the last thing i think about when i go to bed and of course i dream about him and hes the first thing i think about when i wake up. Another thing that is really neat about our relationship is that we do a bible study and devotional together every day. It really helps up to grow closer to eachother and to God who is number 1 in our relationship. My Christianity is really important to me. I was raisedin a Christian home and brought up in church. I am so greatful for my parents and all that they have taught me. They are also still married and i consider myself very lucky to have them since most people now are not as fortunate to have thier parents still together. Me and my mom are very close and i tell her a lot. We have a very open relationship and can depend on eachother for anything. She even gets these gut type feelings about things for example when I started dating David and he spent some time here at the house she told me one night that   she had a good feeling about this one.  meaning she really liked him and could see this relatioship lasting a long time. And so far she is right and i don't see her being wrong any time soon. I am glad that i still live at home while i am going to UT because I don't know where i would be without her. I am not very independent but i am working on that because i know i can not live at home forever. The good thing about living at home besides free food an laundry is that my boyfriend also lives at home with his parents and he only lives like 5 minutes or less from me.  ",1
270,"This is the first time I have ever had an assignment like this before. I have never had to use the internet before, either. I wish that the computer in my room wasn't so difficult to hook up to the UT internet system. I am so tired of going to the same computer store over and over. First, they managed to sell me over one hundred dollars worth of computer equipment that I didn't need. After, that was sorted out, I had problems with the Ethernet card. Oh well, I will ask my boyfriend to fix it for me. I am so glad that he lives in Austin. I am glad that my best friend is my roommate. We always get along and we never fight. It's great because if she wasn't my roommate, then we would have a huge phone bill. So far, everything about UT is as I anticipated. I really didn't believe people when they told me that I would  have classes with over two hundred people. That came out to be half true. I only ended up with twenty or so in my English class and about one hundred and fifty in my biology class. My chemistry and psychology class end up in the same room. both are enormous. I didn't even know how to spell psychology until about three days ago. Whenever I wrote the word I always looked at the course schedule or at my textbook. Books are another problem. The co-op had the wrong listing for my biology book, and I had to go through a huge hassle to get my psych book. I shouldn't be complaining. I really love it here. I love being one in fifty thousand. I love being known as only a social security number. The atmosphere is so relaxed and go with the flow. ""  I think that I am adapting well. Twenty minutes are up. s       ",1
1078,"Wow. what an assignment. I think this has got to be one of the easiest grades I have ever made. I am feeling a bit like Doogie Howser (at the end of each episode, it is night and he normally sits at his computer and types his journals out and reflects upon the events that happened throughout the day). I am typing this in Microsoft word, because it was recommended by your little site and was repeated about 4 times. Although I have Physics tomorrow, which I have no clue what is going on in because my teacher is a bit confused himself. I am feeling relieved because I had this HUGE paper due in my freshman seminar class today and I worked my ass off for it and I feel good about it. I am not all that great of a writer but I think I will get a decent grade on it. Plus it was only a first draft, and we will have to go back and revise them and whatnot. By the time I am completely finished with the paper I am going to despise it but hey, that is how it goes, I suppose. I think it is good for a person to just sit and write or type every once and a while. I have a friend, Olga, who has gone through like 12 journals in the past 3 years. She tries to find time for it everyday. it is her relaxation and when she is really upset or depressed, once she gets everything out. she feels better. Which reminds me, I need to give her a call. I miss her. She goes to Southwest Texas. I am actually sitting on the phone with my boyfriend who is also in the class (Michael Linford). We are both typing this writing assignment at the same time. Well. I thought it was a bit humorous. I am actually in a really good mood, because my boyfriend and I actually live in the same city now. It is a really good feeling. We met last year, here in Austin at debate camp. He is from Colleyville (DallasFort Worth), so we spent just under a year living 4 hours apart from each other. All of my classes are going pretty good, although I still don't really have a clue what I want to major in just yet. I am in the college of Liberal Arts (woo hoo!) and I was thinking about a double major in psychology and government. I also want to go to law school. I seriously doubt I will get into UT's law school. It is way too competitive. * Sigh * who knows, I sure don't. I am living at Dobie right now, and let me tell youI am getting ripped off. It is $7000 a year and I have a little room and have to walked up stairs all the time because I live on the 2nd floor (the ""intensive study floor""), which I never signed up to be in. I guess it isn't all that bad though; at least I'm not at Jester. I don't have a car here because my parents are irrational. I have a car sitting in the garage at home but they didn't want me to bring it with me because they thought it would be some sort of a ""growing experience"" for me. Although I only live around an hour or so away from here (Schertz, TX. near San Antonio) I haven't been home since I have been here. I have no real desire to go home. I hated high school, well I hated it my senior year. All my friends graduated and my classes were a waste of time. I guess that is one of the reasons why I feel I can't compete with some of the people here at UT, my high school didn't have much to offer. I have a good friend of mine (Shala) that came and saw me the weekend before last. She is at UNT and she hates it there. Although I miss her, I think she misses me a whole hell of a lot more. She has resorted to hanging out with people from our high school that didn't give her the time of day for the last 6 years of her life. Jocks and whatnot. Supposedly there is this annoying kid (who I started to resent in high schoolScott Hall) that talks to her nonstop about me. Scott and I were buds back in 8th grade and once we got to high school, I no longer existed. That happened with a lot of my jr. high friends. Back to Shala, well she told me yesterday that she has ""found God. "" If only you knew Shala, you would know that is a load of shit. If she is happy, then hey I am all for it, but I don't think it is something she'll stick with. I am not an atheist or anything but I just don't know and don't care to find out. I am not saying I won't be open to opinions and respectful of one's commitment and dedication but it is something that annoys me. I guess that is because of my parents. They use to force me to go to church, and my dad wouldn't let me go out or do anything on Sundays unless I went (even though he would sit at home, watching football or somethinghypocrite!) Alright. I have far surpassed the 20minute limit and I'm out. ",1
1954,"I know I should probably find this sort of assignment intriguing,"" but really I'm just bored as hell. I think I can honestly say that I never imagined myself doing something like this. I guess it's something I always imagined only druggies and insomniacs did. Then again, I consider myself an insomniac. But like I said. here we are. My only motivation for doing this is that my roommate has promised me that after I finish my writing assignment, we can go to lunch. How sad. She is like my mom. She wakes me up in the mornings when I oversleep, she keeps track of my assignments for the classes we have together, she cleans the room. and even sadder. Food is my only motivation. Meh. In other news, the UT Body Project is going well. I got paid $30 for the seminar I attended yesterday. They want us to ""diet"" for the next week, though they stress that it's not ""diet[ing],"" but more ""finding a homeostasis"" in the course of our daily consumptions. Somehow I don't see that happening. On a lighter note, my new computer is totally freaking super awesome. It's great having a computer that doesn't restart every day, and actually has enough memory to complete whole tasks. My poor baby. I'm not too sure what to do with my old computer. So for now, it's sitting in a Dell box in the middle of my room, taking up space. So it's hard for me to access my closet. But oh well. Who needs clothes anyway. My roommate is sick right now. asking for tissues. This could be a disaster. She is also trying to read what I'm writing, claiming that I'm talking trash about her. . Everything she is heard is true. And, because I'm confident in the fact that no one is going to read this, and on the off chance that they do, they won't give a shit, I'll delve a little bit into my personal life. I wrote an e-mail to S (as we'll call him for now) while he was gone. Though he wasn't technically gone. He went to Harvard for college, and his computer had not yet arrived. Speaking of which, because Harvard is gay, their holiday breaks are all messed up. so they just started school, and while we get out of school on the 7th of may, they don't get out till the 25th I think. It sux0rz. Fortunately, I asked Arjun, and their spring break doesn't coincide with ours. Which means. my roommate Angela and I might go visit them up in Boston during our spring break, if there's enough money, and if we care. But I digress. Then again I guess the point of this is to digress, so by not digressing I actually am digressing. OK I'm not going to confuse myself further. Anyway. back to the e-mail. Right. So I wrote it, and he got back on Tuesday, as he said he would. But by the I'd already gotten my new computer, and installed it and everything. Unfortunately, I don't have the proper network cable to network my computers just yet, so it's still on my old POS computer. Oh well. It wasn't anything important. just a stream-of-consciousness type thing, a lot like this. Except a lot longer. I forget what the point of this story was. Oh well. I guess what I'm trying to say is that a) the Donnie Darko soundtrack is very good, and b) I miss him a lot. A lot a lot. He is going to have fun up at Harvard with his friends, while I'm stuck down here with no ability to make friends whatsoever. It's so depressing. I don't really like it down here. I miss Saikat, and Arjun, and Amit. Bah. I really need to update my journal sometime soon. I think oftentimes, I make such an effort to make the entries I write so pensive, and thought-provoking, that if I'm ever experiencing writer's block, or whatever, I just won't update. What a shame. I need to stop caring about how I write and start worrying about what I write. People don't need to read something well-written to be able to enjoy it. Then again, what's to convince myself that my entries are interesting anyway. Oh poo. In other news, the movie ""The Good Girl"" is really good. It helped me to explore some aspects of my life that I'd never given much thought to. I guess I should have. ",0
2012,"I am in my dorm lost in my own thoughts. My roommate went to Houston so I am left here to do homework and what ever else I decide to do to take up time. the TV is blaring, however, I hardly ever watch it. The people next door are playing their music and I hear some bustling in the hallway. the air conditioning is making this high pitched squeaking noise. Somebody just got off the elevator. My stomach is growling, I have been up for several hours and haven't eaten. I love my computer. I feel sorry for people who do not have a computer in their room. almost all of the classes ise the Internet so it has to be difficult to do much work. I have a really short attention span. That is why I can't watch TV Every thing I see reminds me of something else and I start to not watch the TV. I like it here(UT). I thought that I wouldn't like such a big school because my high school was so small, however, I found that I do like it. It is good to have a change. Some people think that change is not good but I think even the best things need a change every now and then. I have to use the restroom. the light in our bathroom flickers every time you turn it on. It doesn't bother me I'm just glad that my roommate and I have a bathroom to ourselves. I don't know if I would have been able to deal with someone who does not keep their bathroom clean. Dishes in the sink are kind of like that for me too. If there are any in the sink I always do them. I guess you could say that it's a pet peve. Burger King ad is on the TV that sounds good. This computer light is giving me a headache. For the past couple of years my eyes have been giving me a headache. Certain lights hurt my eyes. It is a miracle if I go a day without my head hurting. I like to drive standard cars. I really makes me angry when people buy a sports car that is automatic. It would be so much more fun if it was manual. I am the worlds worst speller. and I think I have dyslexia. I confuse my left and right especially when I'm driving. It's not that I don't know the difference I know which way to go I just say the wrong one. Really I'm just a hypochondriac. My best friend came to visit me this weekend. I had a blast. Now I have to go visit her. She lives in Jacksonville, Texas. Never heard of it, well no one has it's just below Tyler. basketball is now on TV. I don't know who is playing. My cell phone just rang. Too bad they are just going to have to wait I'm in the middle of something. I wonder who it was. oh no my twenty minuets is up. It was nice talking to you. Bye. ",0
1283,"So here I go. I'm writing. Don't know what though cause I think this is hard. Tapping fingers. click, click, click I wish it was Friday This is very artificial. Rereading my words  I don't like it. I thought I would have more to say, but so far not much is coming up. I'm a very bad typist? whatever. Let's go on. I like my rings. I have only four on my fingers, I think I need more. All silver. There was a pause there. So much for writing for a full 20 minutes, including ALL thoughts. :)I like that. Look(!),I bet I don't even get a scrolly bar thing. Yes, my one page stream, more like trickle, of consciousness. So anyways I guess I'll be like everyone else and tell you about my dog. He's a cutie. A mutt but I love him the more for it. I think he's his own breed or dog or whatever. Yup, he's a shortie. We're always tripping over him, poor thing. (Pause) Tap, tap, tap. I wish I could type faster, like the girl next to me. Damn her. oohooh, my time's almost up. Did I mention I like my nails too. I painted them real pretty. I'll have to show them to Chela. I can't wait until Friday. It's been forever since we've all gone out. Time's up. ",0
1552,"All this entire thing is going to be about is about my failing relationship with Ben. I think so many different things that I don't know what to think. I can't help but being hurt by him seeing another girl even though we both agreed that we were going to see other people. I just don't see how he could still love me but be with someone else, I just can't because I don't even have a desire to find another   boyfriend   or whatever. I'm hurt so badly right now, all I want in the world is for him to tell me how much he loves me and always will, but I don't want him to say it only because he knows that's what I want to hear. I have to talk to him about this but I'm so scared. I'm so scared that he'll tell me that he just doesn't love me anymore and that is going to kill me. I don't know what to think!! I mean, if he ever really loved me the way he said he did, I don't see how he could already be dating or talking to someone else. I don't know. I wouldn't mind him dating other girls, it's just that it's been a while since he's let me know how he feels about me, if I know and truly know that he loves me and I get just the occasional reminder of his love, then I truly don't think that I'll have a problem with him seeing other girls because I know that eventually I will be seeing other guys too. But even if I was seeing other guys right this instant, then I would still feel the same way about him. I would still love him as much as I ever did because when you truly care about someone, those feelings don't just go away because the person goes away and if they do, then you never really loved the person anyway. I just love him so much and I am sooo scared that when I talk to him tonight, I'm going to find out what I'm scared to death to find out. And even if he does still care about me, things are just so COMPLICATED!  I mean, take when I come down for Homecoming, yesterday he said he still wanted to see me but he didn't really seem very excited about it as I would hope, maybe he is but he just doesn't like to show it, I don't know. But he's talking to this girl and right now it might not be a big deal, and a month and a half from now, everything with her could have gone to crap or a month and a half from now it could have made its way into being something more and if it is something more by then, is he still going to want to see me if he has her??  That's another thing I have to talk to him about. I am so stressed out about this. It would make my day--my entire LIFE if things just go my way, if he just tells me and makes me truly believe how much he loves me then it will make me so happy because that means so so much to me. It's all I want in the world to know that he still loves me because I still love him so much. And deep down I truly believe that he really does love me. I don't think that he ever lied when he told me how he felt about me so I don't see how it could have changed after only a month or however long it's been. But sometimes I do wonder if love is just something that he throws around. Some of the things he's done and said seem so sincere that he couldn't possibly not truly love me, but sometimes I wonder how easy it will be for him to forget about me and fall in love with another girl who is more convenient for him. But convenience shouldn't be the fucking issue. The issue is his feelings for me and mine for him. Just because I'm gone shouldn't make his FEELINGS any different. It can make other things different and I don't expect him to sit around sulking over me and not dating anyone else for two whole years. ALL I WANT is to be certain of his love!! That's all I want!! Is it so much to ask??  God, I'm such a wuss. I'm sitting here crying over this and I don't even know if he has given it a second thought. Sometimes I think I'm the biggest loser for still being so attached to him but I can't just turn off my feelings. Maybe his love for me just wasn't as strong as mine for him, but he means so much to me and I care so much about him. I'm just so hurt and confused right now. And scared. I know that I really need to know how it is and if he doesn't care about me so I can move on, but I am scared to death to find that out because it is going to completely break my heart, I mean be completely devestating if I found out that he doesn't feel the same way I feel. Oh my gosh, I need to blow my nose so bad. I have so much stuff to do today. I have to go by the financial aid office and the co-op to pick up my check and find out about a weekend job. I need to work out and decide if I'm going to go to ultimate frisbee tonight. I need to study. I just wish time would hurry and go by. I can't wait til next weekend when my family comes to see me. I so wish Ben could come see me, I miss him SO much, but it just sometimes seems like he doesn't really want to see me that badly, even though he says he still want to see me and he has told me that he misses me. I just think that he doesn't think about it nearly as much as I do. I don't know though, it's very possible that he could think about it as much as I do. I don't show him how much I really want to see him, I mean, he knows I want to see him but he doesn't know the extent to which I really truly miss him and can't wait until the day I get to see him again and hold him again and hopefully kiss him again. I miss everything about him SO MUCH, I just can't get over it but still I don't show that to him. So he could want to see me just as much as I want to see him but just not show it to me. He could still love me just as much as I love him but just not be showing it to me because I haven't been showing it to him. Maybe he hasn't said   I love you   because I haven't said it to him either, but I don't say it to him because he doesn't say it to me. It's possible that this is just a vicious cycle and that he really loves me and theres nothing to worry about. I just have to talk to him. It's possible that no matter how many girls he dates that he will still love me as much as ever, I just have to find it out. By the time I get to see him again he may not have anyone else, he might be so excited to see me. I don't know. . I just don't know, all I really know is that I HAVE to talk to him ",0
1401,"Goodness gracious! I am so tired of returning to this page that I absolutely don't know what else to write about nor say except for HELP! This is like my fourth time trying to complete this assignment and I am so tired of it but it is to late to complain now so I might as well shut up and continue on writing or shall I say typing. It looks again like I will be going to bed after midnight, I hope not but I do have a lot of assignments that I still need to complete. My most important assignment will be to get organized because going at this rate I will have a hell of a freshman year just trying to keep up. I am doing a little better now with following my syllabus but I still have a long way to go. Maybe when I get a job I will learn how to manage my time more wisely and I will be able to develop better study skills. My fiance' tells me that I have good study skills I just worry to much and stress myself out over small unimportant things that have nothing to do with my classes or myself. To be honest, I do believe that I do get stressed out over every little thing but I think that I am getting a lot better at handling different situations, like this one. My biggest problem is that I really miss him and it is so hard being here in Austin all alone while he is in North Carolina. Hopefully after this year we will be able to come up with a compromise and a solution to all of our problems and concerns. I miss him and I am really looking forward into seeing him in a couple of months. Well, my time is about up and I really need to go so that I can begin to tackle my other UT coursework. I have to make my grades so that they won't make me. ",1
2151,"I have no idea what to type. am I supposed be be capitalizing and what not?  oh well. hmm its mike's birthday today. he is 22, that must be nice. wow, this is a great song straylight run - the tension and the terror. it's freezing in here. I need to finish reading government and psychology, and hopefully on the road too. it's a lot easier reading that though. yoga's at 8:30. am I supposed to meet melissa there or is she coming back to the room?  o well. I miss mikey =(  man, as I'm whining as if this is a diary entry. man, I forgot to call alex again. I guess I'll do it later. hmm, I wonder how tough rowing tryouts really are. o well. man, all I'm saying is o well. still not really sure what I'm supposed to be writing. now I'm listening to the juliana theory. good stuff. I'm not all about the class dj's choice of rap stuff. I don't think he is right about it making people more energetic. hearing a song for the millionth time that wasn't good the first time does not exactly put me in a great mood for an hour and a half psych lecture. but I do think I'm going to like the class (as I'm kissing up to the computer). no, its interesting stuff though. hmm, I'm still not sure about how government is going to be. I want to do law, and I think it's really interesting, but there's no way I'll have time for all the reading. and a lot of it is way too boring. hopefully if I take notes in class and what not I'll be ok. I hope calc won't be too hard this semester. a lot of it should still be review from high school, but I bet the end will be new hard stuff. too bad mikes not still around. the engineering majors are too damn smart. am I supposed to censor stream of conscious writing? because I figure that goes against the point, so I shouldn't go back and fix stuff, but this sure as heck isn't formal. o well. of course I am tempted to go back and count how many times I've said o well. ridiculous. hmm, I should really clean this room. but I guess most of the mess on my side is amber's junk. o, I guess no psych tomorrow. more time to nap in the afternoon, which is good because I know I'll be up way too late if I'm going to get close to finishing the reading for government. how late is gregory open?  I think 1 but is that every day?  I guess megan will know. we can always run outside too. the heat sucks, but I guess we should get used to it if we're going to have to do tryouts in the afternoon. texas is too damn hot. I miss wisconsin. we got to road trip over xmas. I don't know what to tell the parents though. hmm I'll have to plan. that way we can go by michigan like we told mike we would. hmm I miss summer. I know fall won't compare. I'm so sick of stupid frat parties, etc. at least I have awesome roomies. well, looks like times almost up and I've spent 20 minutes whining and doing this assignment completely wrong. once more, oh well.

429,"I used to day dream about  this time when I was younger. After I saw my brother and sister leave for college, I decided that was going to be the best part of my life. Of course, it is a lot different now that I am here. There is a lot more responsibility in reality than there is in my dreams. I don't really mind it so far. I want to be able to handle it, and I am excited about my classes. I wish that I could be an expert in every subject that I take. Psychology is very interesting to me, but not enough to be my major--I wouldn't want to do it for the rest of my life. My brother has a bachelors degree in psychology from Southwest texas, but he hasn't done much with it. I am taking this class as a social science elective; my other classes are required for my major. Right now I am an undeclared major, but after a few classes in my geology of engineering course, I am pretty sure that I want to major in geosystems engineering. It seems to incorporate a large amount of subject material that I am interested in, and it would be a job that pays pretty well. If I did well enough at UT to get into grad school, I would love to follow it up with a masters or Phd in Geology. Of all the courses I have taken in high school and college, these seem to be the best ones. Some of my favorite subjects are: geology, geography, astronomy, archaeology, and history. I would love to be an astronomer in a second if it paid well enough. My reason for this is that eventually I would like to have a large spread of land in the hill country somewhere west of Austin--near a lake--with a boat. This requires $$. I love the outdoors, and I want to live away from the city, yet close enough to it that I could drive into town to do things. This is probably a common ambition among people, but I don't really care. Enough rambling about all that. My reason for being here at UT is to learn, and to get an education, and to do well. If I do all of this I will be very pleased. It will be hard though. I love to have fun, and that can easily get in the way at UT. I haven't joined a fraternity or gone out for rush yet, even though some of my friends who are in frats here keep bugging me. I want to join some organization that has fun and kicks ass at a lot of things. Hopefully that will work out. These are the things that are on my mind at the moment; at least until I move on to the next thing. ",1
1840,"Well, I don't really know what I am suppose to be doing, so I'll just do the best that I can. I have a lot of thoughts going on in my mind right now. I feel nervous, yet excited to find what college life has yet to bring me. I feel that I need to manage my time more, because I am so scared that everything is going to catch up with me. All weekend I've said that I need to do something, but just can't seem to figure out What I should do. I talk to my mom everyday, and it makes me really sad. Everyday I think of my family and how much I miss them. We are so close and my nieces and nephews mean the world to me, and everytime I talk to them on the phone it makes me cry. I even felt like just leaving, but I know that I have to stay here in order to succeed. My boyfriend doesn't really help out much in making me feel better. He just doesn't understand how it feels to actually miss family. He gets so mad at me just because I call her and he says by me doing that it doesn't make things any better. It's just that she is so sad because I am not there and she's all alone. She thinks that I won't ever come home again, and I know that's not true. I just wish there was a way for me to let her know that. She thinks that just because I left I won't ever see her again. I know that I will never move back home after I graduate, but it will always be home, and I know I will visit her. I also feel so pressured, in soo many ways. I just worry that I won't make it here. I just want it to all end soon. I want to finish school as quickly as possible, because I feel that I need to begin my life. I mean not begin my life, but actually start my own. I need to get out and see the real world on my own perspective. My mom has held this shield over me my whole life, so being here has opened my eyes a whole lot. I've learned so much, but know that I have so much more to see. I really wish I could experience more things though. I mean having a boyfriend holds me back a lot. I haven't gotten to experience all the things that I should.   Sorry I don't know if this is going to work, but I realized I didn't put in my social or name. 462898153- Virginia Moreno ",1
2164,"words are pouring out like endless rain into a paper cup they (?). but I like to use     periods. before, I was tempted to say, last night my ears met their lover. too bad they     didn't. haven't?  I just wanted to use that nice quote I stole from an editor of epitonic. I     have an hour till I have to go to LINK but I really don't know about this whole Christian     organization on campus thing I need to find one that fits me!  oh thoughts and feelings     sometimes I stare out at nothing in particular and it's in those times that I am thinking     about absolutely nothing oh I just got a call. but I'm still typing!  darn you booksellers call     back after nine thirty. I wonder if typos make a difference because I don't like leaving     them behind like that, so careless. So, I need to get a haircut. But how do I know which     kind?  You know, some people just look good no matter what. I think it's a level of     achievement that I will never reach. Oh well. What if people were the same inside and     outside?  Like, for example, if all the pretty people were extremely good souls. Now that'd     make things different. I can't really imagine what it'd be like, because I'm so busy thinking     about what I should write next. Man, what should I pursue?  My stomach is really full. I     used to think that if I ever smoked, I could quit anytime, just because it seems so gross. Well I can't even moderate my eating habits. And I bash myself about it, but when hunger     calls, I respond. In full!  So yeah. Sometimes I fear for my safety when I'm walking around     at night. Nothing ever bad has ever happened but I think I should still be careful. But I     don't think so enough since I'm going to do it tonight anyway. I'm going to watch the     Goonies at the Texas Union Theater. Theatre. Yeah. Hey. I wonder if I'm going to make     any good friends here at college. It's bad hanging out with old ones all the time, and     believe me, sometimes I just don't want to. Excuse me. I just sneezed. What if I do really     think in sentences?  I think I have a cold. My nose is rubbed pretty raw (well, not really)     from all the tissues. I'm not thinking about anything. Actually, what I would like is to     complete everything I need to get done soon. I don't know how possible that might be but     then that would leave me time to do leisurely activities, like reading and responding to     other people's e-mails. I'm so bad at that. And so I could have time to read the Bible and     pray. Ah, I cannot control what I do, or at least I'm not trying hard enough. It seems so     easy to be a good Christian when the pastor is talking about it but then laziness gets the     best of me. Oh I can wait. You know, I don't want to think I'm invincible. I want to make a     difference and experience life fully. The things I am most scared about now: public     speaking. I just want to die when all eyes are on me- the bigger the audience, the more     humiliating. You know, it's not like I can control how I feel, to an extent at least. I am also     afraid of getting into a car accident because my close friends just did and it seems     unbearable, the time in the hospital spent recovering. So many tubes. I'd cry out. And I'm     afraid of falling off my bike or getting into some other bike related accident. It's not so     much the pain that bothers me, but the public scene it would cause. How embarrassing. Oh well. Sometimes I don't care what other people think. Sometimes I wonder what they     think of me. When I'm shy, I tend to come across as being mean. I haven't really opened     up to anyone before. Why should I if I don't trust them or if I'm not sure that they care     about what I feel or think. I think I'm good at observing people in their behaviors. When     I'm talking to someone, I can tell if they lose interest in what I'm saying. At that very     moment when they look away for a second. I don't feel bad when that happens but it just     makes me lower the probability of me finding someone or some people who can connect     with me. I know. People need people. And I need a tissue right now. Is this going to be     read?  If it is, it's okay. I don't know if my thoughts are interesting, but it would be a fun     thing to grade. I feel like I'm spending less quality time when I'm reading out of my     textbooks. I want to go back, but then I just get this feeling of urgency. Even when I'm     surfing the net. Imagine that. What do I have to do anyway?  What's the difference     between an erection and an ejaculation?  I think I might know, but it doesn't matter so     much to me. I don't like it how professors can say whatever they want to say, like curse     words and sex related and other inappropriate topics. Just because they can talk about it     doesn't mean they should. Sheesh. I also don't like how repeated exposure to talk I don't     agree with and cuss words will desensitize me to it completely, probably by the end of the     semester. Here I am in college and I don't know everyone but a lot of them are making me     less pure. I don't think they realize what they're doing to the rest of us. What rest of us,     you ask?  I guess we are a minority then. I wonder what I'm going to do for the final     project in my freshman seminar. Either fencing, a Christian organization on campus, if I     ever find a good one!  or a concert. Although a concert might be kinda difficult since I'm     not going to one until October 7th. Yay for Beulah!  I'm so excited. When I go to shows, I     feel like I belong. I don't know anyone there, but I like to observe them. Most of them     have styles. I wish I had a style. I want to be like them. Or do I?  I want to be like me!  But,     I need to be more like me then. Maybe if I had a lot more money. I do have a lot of     money. What does being fashionable feel like?   Not as great as I think, of course. It just     hurts to see people wearing things out of fashion when they think they are in fashion. We     are the elite. At least my mind can distinguish between the two. But only street. What do     I make of myself then?  It's easy not to care, but it's not so easy to do that completely. Will     that make people like me more?  Is it easy to avoid everyone and keep to myself?  Is that     what we were meant to do?  The answer is no. What if it's different for me?  Everyone dies     alone, right Donnie?  I think I need clothes to reach the next level. Of making me satisfied. Oh, if I had a different body. No, no. That's alright then. People who know you don't care. It's the people you are trying to impress who care!  Hah. I wonder if I ever hurt anyone's     eyes. It pains me to think so. Before I left for college, at the goodbye dinner thrown for     me by my uncle, the message in my fortune cookie (or rather, one of them) was be     yourself and you will always be in fashion. ""  I suppose that's valid. Ooh I can continue     writing. Maybe for a bit longer. I wonder what it would be like to be very fashionable. I     mean, come on, I already struggle against feelings of superiority when it comes to music. What good does it do?  There are always better, there are always worse. But I won't say any     more about that. You know, I can't give all of myself away    and to a stranger!         (ok, I finished editing my paper)_ do you think that this (spilling out thoughts on paper) is     healthy for all of us?  not that it's not, but compared to making no difference    I think so. ",1
2175,"This is my first year here at the University of Texas and I am very overwhelmed with all of the expectations. It is so hard for me because I have had to learn how to get around in such a large town, on such a huge campus, and living on my own for the first time is crazy. I have to find a job because I need to be able to pay my bills and I still have so much school work that I have to keep up with. At the Junior College I attended everything was very personal and it was easy to talk to a teacher or advisor whenever you needed to. Here everything is done over the computer which I guess is good since we are in the electronic age, but I just like the old fashioned way of pen and paper and face to face. I miss my family, especially my sister. I moved here by myself and I really don't know anybody here in Austin. I've never had to do so much walking in my life!  I guess I should get all the exercise that I need walking back and forth to my classes. I'm worried that I won't be able to keep up in classes. I think I'm just nervous because everything has been a big change and I'm still very overwhelmed by all of it. I just wish sometimes that it would be a little bit easier and people would be a little bit more explanatory about things. Twenty minutes is a long time to write. I never thought I would feel pressured to think. I guess my thoughts don't come that often or just don't continue for twenty minutes straight. I still have ten more minutes to write. I wonder how these will be graded. I have so much to do today. I need to wash clothes, go to the grocery store, I have to clean since a friend is coming to visit me this weekend, and I have a test I have to start studying for. I hope the test won't be too difficult. I always worry about the first tests in a class. They pretty much set the tone for the rest of the semester. If you do really bad, then you have to bust your butt for the rest of the semester, if you do good then your pretty much set for a successful semester. I wish that all teachers would do a review. Reviews for tests really help me to learn the material because I end up going over it again and again. I guess its really repetition that makes me learn. Man, I still have five more minutes to write. I have never been in a class that was as big as this psychology class. I was totally blown away by the amount of students that are in that class. I bet its really hard to teach to an audience of that size. There must be so many distractions for the professor because I know I get distracted just sitting there. In an auditorium you can hear so many noises because of the echoes, sometimes your focus drifts away. I think that I'm going to like this class. It seems like it will be interesting and fun. I think that if every class was interesting and fun, then the college would be full of 4. 0 students walking down the street. My finance class is one of the classes that interests me the very least.

458,"I think that I am just supposed to write whatever flows from my mind for this one, so here I go. I really like the theory that writing about a problem helps you sort it out. It is interesting to me that putting that problem onto paper helps symbolically remove it from the mind. Theories like that always seem to capture my imagination, I am a huge fan of symbolism. I miss my girlfriend a lot. I think about her multiple times each day, she just pops into my head all the time. I wish I could have called her today, but I just didn't have time. I just realized that I called her my girlfriend. I guess we are broken up now, but more because life drew us apart than any conscious decision. I am dying for some reason to call her and tell her that I love her. I haven't said that in a long time, I think it will make her incredibly happy to hear it. I hope she hasn't given up on us, although that is extremely unlikely. I have not been able to talk with her much lately because she has been grounded, but when we spoke the other day she still sounded like she cares. We've been through so much, I think she always will care about me. It seems almost corny to say ""We've been through so much"" because everyone says that about their sign. other. But with Christal and I it's not like we've just been through a time where we fought with our parents or ended up almost splitting up, we have walked as close to Hell as I care to come. There are still some things I hate remembering and I block from my mind. Every now and then I will remember something which seemed to have vanished from my memory and I am amazed I didn't remember such intense emotion before I was reminded. I suppose it is repression, it is very odd. I don't like to think about a lot of the things we went through, it's just an emotional roller coaster I don't want to ride again. I still imagine myself with Christal automatically when I think of the rest of my life and who I will be with. I cannot wait until semester when we can spend more time together. I just got a flash of memory of what it is like to be a couple who sees each other and spends together a lot. I miss her being an active everyday part of my life. She is still an everyday part of my life, but only in my thoughts. Not in physical reality. I will definitely call her tomorrow, after my dreaded chemistry test. I am sure I could be studying so much better right now if I had talked with her today. I am scared that when she finds out about Shea it will hurt her incredibly, the odd thing is I would do it again. But it remains to be seen if I would do it again after we talk. I feel so out of touch with her. She changed so much in the wake of everything that happened I feel like I need to get to know my best friend again. I am sure that her core personality is still the same though, I just feel weird because we have both changed and grown so much apart from one another, I am scared that we grew into two people who aren't supposed to be together.

1404,"Stream of consciousness I have had a very rough week this week. I never dreamed that I would be so busy at college with classes and fraternity engagements; at least not on the weeknights. I feel that the sleep depravation may begin to catch up with me. Perhaps as time passes I will learn how to better manage my time on campus. It does not help that I have little, hour long breaks inbetween all of my classes, and I guess I should use that time to study, maybe outside the Student Union or the FAC building. We had a gentleman from the Learning Center come by the fraternity house and scare me by speaking about high school students whom have come to the university with straight A's and left with D's because they did not know how to study, for this I am a prime candidate. I never studied in high school save for calculus. At least I will not have trouble with Writing papers, as I am quite affluent with the subject. I write a lot in my English class, which is taught by a disorganized hippie. He is a nice man but is very difficult to gauge. This professor also has a very ludicrous way of assessing grades; he uses something called the Online Learning Record. I have yet to figure the whole thing out but it seems to me, that it is a totally fallacious way of determining a student's progress through his own introspection. I guess I am a product of conventional thinking and teaching; maybe the class will be good for me. I feel, at least overall, that my classes are very well taught with the one exception. I have, however, heard that my psychology professor gives very difficult tests, but I am a very good test taker, we'll see. My only real concern so far is time management and maintaining a decent level of sleep, which I have yet to achieve so far. I guess I need to skip a few social events and get some rest, though I have met a very nice girl already whom I like very much; I recently asked her to O. U. weekend and she politely accepted. Hopefully, our relationship will not crumble between now and the time of the game. There is another girl who I feel bad about not asking, though I imagine that she will find another date. We where seeing each other quite a bit before I met the other, though I am sure she does not care as much as I am probably pretending she is. I guess that this is enough, and would like to close by stating that the first two weeks have absolutely flown by, and I am hopeful that my grades will remain high throughout the semester. ",0
32,"Today has been the worst and most stressful day ever. All I want is for  something to go right!  I tried to dot his paper about thirty seconds ago but it didn't work because again I've messed something up! I was talking about this in my last stream of consciousness paper that I thought was gone but realized after I had erased half o of it that it was really still there! AAhhh!  Can something please go right?   My Ethernet card was not properly packaged and is causing me and a few others serious drama because we've all been trying to make it work for four days now. I don't even know if I'm supposed to push enter when I get near the end of the line but I figure better safe than sorry as far as grades go. I just looked at the clock and I've only been writing for four minutes. Why does time go  by so slowly when it counts. Speaking of timing, mine is the worst!  I always like guys either before or after they like me but never while they like me. Whenever I like a guy I'm to shy, stupid, scared,  immature to let him know, and by the time or if he likes me I have lost interest!  Or they never have interest in the first place and I find that challenging and will pursue that guy instead  of the  one who likes me!  Or in one case I'll find out that after liking me four two straight years, he decides to change sex preferences when I like him. AHHH!  Actually I had my chance and now I'll have to live with regret forever, or until he wants an opposite sex relationship!  Ten minutes to go and I'm running out of self-deprecating and embarrassing stories of my miserable unromantic life! I want someone who respects the fact that I'm not a traditional female and that likes my odd sense of humor and is also funny himself and finds me attractive. . Which reminds me as I look above my roommateÃ¯Â¿Â½s computer of another guy who I let slip through the cracks Even though there was a slim chance of anything ever happening, I never acted on my feelings,  Wait a minute I did spill my guts while playing truth or dare with him and other friends. I wish I could play truth or dare with the other guy I like(d) so that he'll know that it was me and not him that kept us ;apart, I liked you then and I liked you up until I found out there was no chance for us and I resented you a little!  Someday I'll get up the courage to tell him!  It is about twenty degrees Fahrenheit in my lovely room in Jester East on the tenth floor. The air Conditioning vent is blowing right in my face as I type. I have been having stomach problems all day, and they are starting to resurface,  I almost passed  out at the draw for the football game against Rutgers this Saturday, I refuse to paint my face half orange and half white as my roommate hopes I will. One minute to go and I'm starting to feel relieved that I wont have to think about this particular assignment ever again. Five percent of my grade is secured and pretty soon I'll be doing those psych experiments and that will be easy too. I'm majoring in psychology but I used to want to be an architect. Oops, I got carried away and wrote one minute over, now it is two. ",0
1064,"Right now I'm thinking about the situation I am going through with my two roommates. School has just started and it looks like we will soon be at each others' throats. I really hope we can find a way to not get on each others' nerves because we are such good friends. I'm also thinking about my life and the new frontiers I am beginning to encounter. I can't stop thinking about how the next four years of my life are going to turn out. I hope everything is as great as everyone says it is and has been. I also miss my mom very much. Even though I don't talk to her everyday on the phone, I can hear speaking to me with her heart. The same thing goes for me too. My classes and keeping a responsible daily routine are at the top of my priority list right now. I don't want anything to interfere with me doing an exceptional job in all of my courses. It really is a big change for me being here at a university. Back home school was a breeze. Now I can actually feel that I'm going to have to study, which will be a first for me. The good side to that is that I like challenges. One of my friends from back home, who is really close to me, is planning to move to Florida. There isn't anything wrong with that because he's ""in love"". I hope that he's making the right decision with the move and with her. I really care about him and I wouldn't want him to get hurt in any way. Although, I have a strange feeling that she might be the one for him. Either way he always has a lucky star just waiting to fall on him so that somewhat takes away a bit of my worriness. My other friends who are very close to me are still in my hometown going to school over there. I miss them all the time but I know that me being here is the best thing for me. For some reason I can't stop thinking about a girlfriend of mine who lives in San Antonio because she is attending St. Mary's University. There has always been an unspoken romance between us but we have never actually been together because we have never brought it up, but we know that something is there. ",1
1956,"Right now I am sitting in my dorm room thinking about how much reading I have to finish tonight. I am listening to the radio as I write this. Jessica Simpson is what I am listening to. I am also thinking about how many typing errors I make as I type. I am drinking Pink Lemonade and chewing Orbit gum. I am also thinking about my boyfriend, and waiting for either an email or a phone call from Kuwait. I am very worried about him, but he reassures me everyday that he will be ok. I have to read a lot of Biology tonight. I also have to get my clothes together for tomorrow morning. Tomorrow is the start of my first full week as a college student. I don't like college to much, it is quite boring and time consuming. I would prefer to be going to college closer to home or at home, but here is where I find myself. Oh well, it's okay. I'm testing the waters and seeing how I like this place. So far so good, the football games are fun and my classes are interesting. Except for one of my Biology classes, my professor is evil. I wish that my boyfriend would call, I would really like to talk to him. I miss him so much, and I can't wait till he comes home. I have lots of pictures of my family and boyfriend in my room. They are all over, I miss them all so much. I hate being this far from them, but I have to do what I have to do. I am full from eating a giant burrito at Freebirds about an hour ago. I keep staring at my cell phone hoping someone will call me. I still have to do some Pre Calculus homework and read for Psychology too. I received one Instant Message, I wonder who it was from. Probably my little cousin who bothers me all the time. Everytime someone signs on and off the internet that annoying door sound plays. It gets on my nerves. I wish it was Saturday still, I had fun on Saturday. I am tired of typing and I want to start my reading so I can go to bed. My roommate is going to Jack n the Box, and she asked if I wanted anything, but I do not like burgers or greasy food anymore. Plus I am watching my figure and do not want to get the dreaded Freshman 15!"" I just got an email but I can't read it until this is over I want to read it so bad because it might be from my boyfriend. Dang I so wish that I could check my email, with my luck it probably was my boyfriend. My music stopped and no it is silent in my room but I can hear some music from my RA's room. I think her roommate is playing the music. It sounds funny from here but oh well. I'm really tired from staying up so late of Friday night, but I guess that's what I get. This gum is already starting to lose flavor and I just barely put it in my mouth. Yuck! Blah! I got new sunglasses this weekend. I like them a lot. I got to shop some this weekend, and I bought more food for my room. I didn't need any of it, but it was definitely a spur of the moment type thing. I really need to read my Biology so I can read my Psychology so that I can take a shower and go to bed. It's only been 13 minutes since I began typing and I feel like I have been typing forever. I am worried about my Biology class and I hope I do good. I don't want to let anyone back home down. I want to be able to prove my ex friend wrong that I can be on my own, since she was to chicken to leave home. But I don't like her anyways, she has an obsession with thinking my world revolves around her, when obviously hers revolves around me. I don't know if that made sense, but I don't really care. Only five more minutes left and I am running out of things to write about. I got another email and now I am pretty sure it is my boyfriend. This is the longest 5 minutes of my life. I also have never made this many mistakes when I type. Oh well. I want to run downstairs and get myself some snacks. I wish I could go get some right now but I have to finish writing. I realize that I can't wait to get something over with and then when I start it I don't really feel like finishing it. Oh well, only a little bit more time left. Then I can cross this off my to-do list for the week. I miss my boyfriend so much, I cannot wait till he comes home. I get to go home next month! YAY! I can't wait to see my family and my puppy! I am thinking about all the times I had when I was at home. I had a sense of security there, I am very family oriented and I miss them a lot. Only 30 seconds left. And then I have more to do tonight. I have so much to do in so little time. Time to get it all done so I'm not swamped this week. ",1
2213,"Today has not been a very good day for me. I found out that my roommate is secretly dating my ex-boyfriend behind my back. My friend and I caught them together last night in the courtyard outside of my dorm. This is one of the worst feeling I have ever felt. I am dating a boy right now, but  the feelings for my ex have started to resurface. She fully knows that I like him, but she is deceiving me. I was very irritable today and I was rude to a lot of people. I really am not a rude person, I just do not understand why people find it necessary to take advantage of my niceness. I went to Pappasito's last night to pick up some to go food. It is sitting in my refrigerator and I am very anxious to eat it. I already had some chips, salsa, queso, and guacamole today. I love Mexican food. I have a French test tomorrow. This is our second test. I thought I made an A on the last test, but when I got it back I found a much lower grade. It upset me, so I am going to study very hard for this test. Right now I have a 4. 0 at the university, and I want to keep it as close to that as possible. I have noticed while typing this that I never capitalize 'I'. I have gone back and fixed my work at least ten times. I am used to typing informally online, where grammar and capitalization does not matter. My roommate just left for an environmentalist meeting, and I wanted to go read some of her AIM logs. So, I walked over to her computer and was starting to read some when the door started to shake and I thought I heard  her key in the door. I was so scared that she was going to come in and catch me. From that experience I have realized that I don't want to be snooping in her stuff anymore. It would not be worth it if she came in and caught me. We already are going to be on semi-bad terms after I talk to her tonight about Chris. One of our good friends thinks that once I talk to her about it she will drop the whole thing. He said that she felt really bad about going behind my back and she knew it was ""too good to be true"". Oh come on. She met him like three days ago, there is no way she likes him that much. It just hurts me so bad to know that she ignores our friendship  and goes after something that she knows will hurt me. Last night our friend talked to her about it and told her that she needed to drop it or else neither of us would talk to her. She told him that she was not sure what she wanted to do because Chris is ""special"". That is what got to me the most. She is willing to throw away two friendships for a boy she just met like 3 days ago. I am already stressed out enough with school, I do not need roommate problems. This is the reason I do not hang out with girls, they do this sort of thing to each other. My guy friends have never hurt me intentionally like this. When they try to get to me, they use force. Like one time my guy friends all attacked me with pillows. It got frustrating, but I did not get emotionally hurt by it. Girls get you in the worst possible way. Tonight Mean Girls is showing at the Union. I want to go see it so bad because I love that movie. It is so good. I would go see it if I did not have to do all of this homework. I already had a test last week in French, I am upset that there is another one this week. Our teacher also assigns us homework on the night before our test. It is safe to say that we are going to be studying for the test, so there is no need to assign homework. Oh well. I have not done laundry since I arrived here in Austin. I am down to my last pants and shorts. I will probably do some tonight, if I don't get too lazy. I have treated this writing assignment as like a journal. I have a lot of stuff on my mind from this whole roommate thing, so it is good that I could write it all out. It has been kind of hard to keep writing constantly. My hand are getting kind of numb. I think it is because I never use the shift key to capitalize things, and now I have to. Well, my time has come to an end. Time to get back to more homework. ",1
380,"All I want to do is sit on my couch and take a nap while sitting in front of the TV. I'm trying really hard to not procrastinate as much as last semester. I usually wait until the last minute to accomplish anything. This was assigned about two weeks ago and I'm just know doing it. I've had plenty of time to do it, but I find myself wanting to plop in front of the TV instead. I love being a couch potato. My mind wonders a lot and people tell me that I'm a daydreamer. Whoever reads this will probably agree that I can't keep my train of thought on one idea for more than two minutes. This weekend I have to go home and see my grandmother who is in ICU because she was in a car wreck. I really hate going to hospitals and seeing how sick everyone there is. It scares me to think of what might happen to me in the future. My mom told me that she probably won't even remember me. I can't decide whether or not to hang out with my friends when I go home this weekend. I know that I will and will not accomplish a lick of homework or reading, but I will still give it a whack and take my books home. I don't know why I even bother lugging them around when I know that they will sit in the corner of my room. My brother and I are not speaking and it's been about two weeks so I kind of miss him. I'm supposed to be in his wedding in November so we better start talking by then. I can't decide what I want to do tonight. I might try staying in for once but that is very unlikely. Even though there isn't really anything terribly exciting going on during the week I still manage to find anything to do but be at home. There actually isn't anything good on TV at 12:30 PM, but I sit in front of the TV anyway. Usually I keep asking myself why I'm watching this stupid show and wonder who in the hell actually thought that shows like ""Sister Sister"" and ""the Smart Guy"" were even remotely funny. Why do those shows even stay on?  I don't know a single person that watches or thinks that they are funny. ",0
226,"It is 5:24 in the afternoon. I wonder how long 20 minutes really is and how much I can write. time always seems to go by so slow when IÃ¯Â¿Â½m bored out of my mind. it's too quiet in this room. usually there's people constantly talking, walking in and out, shouting, banging, or anything to cause distraction. you see, IÃ¯Â¿Â½m in my cousin frank's room. well, we're not really blood cousins, just cousins by marriage- his aunt married my uncle. anyway, he's pretty cool. I hated him when I was a kid. we were in the same Chinese class and he was one of those really annoying, obnoxious boys that always teased the girls. I guess we're pretty close now. it was pretty scary finding out we were cousins, but its fun calling each other that. ugh. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m so bored. the only noise I hear is the humming of the a/c which is right above the desk. it's hot, and the a. c. 's not cool enough to keep me comfortable. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m really paranoid about frank's room. he's a pretty messy guy, and someone just came in here complaining that there were fleas in here. yuck. I hate bugs of any shape and size. all I know is that IÃ¯Â¿Â½m beginning to feel itchy everywhere. man, it's only 5:35 now. about half way through this writing assignment. laddy da dee da. I don't know what to write. the more I sit here, the more impatient I get and the more paranoid I am about these bugs around me. frank lives inside an Asian fraternity house. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m not trying to say Asians are dirty, but sometimes the guys do get a little lazy. I wish they'd clean up a bit. even right after the clean, it's still a mess. it smells moldy, the lighting is really bad, the air is thick, and it just feels nasty walking in here. I hate taking showers or going to the bathroom here. the dim lights are constantly flickering, the seats are a dingy yellow/brown color, and it stinks like shit. and the one stall that's actually half way decent has no lights in it. I basically take a shower in the dark. and the worst part is that I paranoid about guys walking in and out of the bathroom while IÃ¯Â¿Â½m in there changing. all the guys here know me and respect my boyfriend, but it's just the thought of guys there. yes. it's 5:41. and frank and my friend Tony just got back. they're starting their own racing crew and just picked up stickers for their cars. mmm. and they brought back food. even though I don't like McDonalds, I always crave it when I smell it. oh well, IÃ¯Â¿Â½m just gonna eat some since my time's up. yeah! ",1
1730,"Ok. I don't like to write, but I guess this isn't really writing. there is a hair stuck between the keys. Ans I can't get it out. it is bothering me. Why are my dogs barking?  Maybe my sister is home from school. I don't know what to write. My nose itches. I am hungary. I want to go to chilli's, but I don't kow if I can. I am so bad at typing. Man, I wish that I had my computer. I can't beleive that no one was here when it came. I better get it by this weekend. ok, i guess my sister isn't here. Then why were my dogs barking?  When is she going to be home?  She should be here by now?  What time is it?  Ya, she should be here. Josh's sister is home allready. Is thst how you spell allready?, or do you spell it   already   with one l?  ah, it hasn't even been 10 minutes left. I think that I burnt my tongue on that kolache. It wa sgood though. I want that other piece of it. I miss my little kids from la petite. I wander if I should get a job there on just fridays. But, I don't know if I will have time to work and get all of my studying done. Probibly not, because I am already a little behind on my reading. I hate Chemistry. I really dread going to that class. I don't understan it at all. It's like the profesor just skips over the basics. How am I suposed to remember all that crap from sophmore year in high school. I should have goe to that help session thing. well, it would have helped if I knew where it was. I wander what Josh is doing. Hopefully he is done with his interview and is on his way here. well, I know he isn't because he would have called me. Did he take Tish out to Taylor with him?  bla bla bla. Where is Kristen?  I am getting worried, I should call mom. Maybe she stayed for tutorials or she missed the bus. I hope she is ok. I need to call my mom. I really want shrimp pasta stuff. That would be really good. I need to read. I have so much reading to do for biology. I don't want to take Amber to her school. What a pain in the but, I am never going to be able to finish reading tonight. I don't have time.

1344,"I'm going to be late, why did I schedule my classes so late in the day? I heard it was better to have later classes, but isn't 2pm for my first class a bit too late? It's too much trouble to change it, and oh my gosh! How am I supposed to concentrate in a room of about 500 people with my Microeconomics professor being so plain and boring. It reminds me of my U. S. History class junior year. it was crazy, I could barely stay awake. 2pm is generally when I take my afternoon nap as well, you know? Now it's twice as hard to stay awake in that class at that time. And today I've got a 12:30pm class, which I guess is a better time, don't you think? Yesterday I had a lot of time to spare before class, so I woke up early, and went to go work out, which worked out ok. I'm going to go workout to day as well. I'm going to try to work out as much as possible. you know how they talk about the freshman 15? That scares me. I mean I can see how freshmen can gain that weight. For example, I ended up skipping breakfast yesterday, and had a big lunch, which is more that I generally would eat for a lunch. SO I end up eating more than usual. But for dinner I had a sandwich and some cereal, so I think that was better. At home I just constantly snacked, which I heard is actually better than eating full meals. But at home, I actually had food lying around the house that I could just pick up at any time. IN my dorm, on the other hand, we've got ants, so I can't just have food out everywhere. And while others have a whole pantry full of food in their dorm, I've got a box of crackers, cereal, some soup, and fruit snacks. I haven't had milk in awhile, maybe I'll have milk for breakfast today. should I? Because if I do that then I won't really have a lunch, but breakfast for lunch you know? Uhh. I don't know, Everything is pretty new. This whole college lifestyle. Oh my gosh the first couple of days I was here I was really depressed. I didn't see very many of my friends, and the friends that I was seeing weren't my closest of friends. But we went over to one of my friend's dorms the other day, and just hung out and talked about old time. now that was fun. It's hard getting all together though, because everyone's got their own schedule and things to do. It'd be nice to get together again. One day at lunch I got together with a whole group of my friends, it was a lot of fun. better than just having a boring lunch with some friends that barely even talk. And my dorm room. I mean I like it, but when you compare to other peoples dorm rooms. oh my gosh! Some people really went all out. I on the other hand, just put up a few decorations and some stickers. Well some will bust out with poster and a billion frames surrounding their bed. I mean that's cool and all, but I guess I wasn't prepared to do all that. That's another thing. A lot of people already have siblings who are going here, or have previously gone here. That's why they know so much about the organizations and the things around Austin. They also have access to a car, another thing I don't have, which can get kind of hard. What if I want to go back to Houston? I don't really feel comfortable asking just anybody for a ride, and the bus? I don't know. I haven't actually sat on a bus to go from city to city. And I don't want to make my family drive three hours to Austin, just to pick me up, and three hours back to Houston, then all over again to drop me back off to school. I don't know. they say there's so much to do on campus and to get involved, but in what?? There are so many different organizations, and the one I want, I can't find. I heard that there was an Armenian cultural association in Austin, and that'd be really cool if I actually found the members and joined. I tried to look them up online, but apparently the web site doesn't work. I'm not really open and just start talking to people, so making a whole new group of friends is not challenging, but not so easy either. My suitemate is real comfortable just talking to anybody. I on the other hand, don't find it so easy. I'm hungry. should I get some lunch? I haven't really had a real breakfast. Did I already say that? Hmm. so should I just get some cereal, because I'm not all that hungry, or should I get a lunch? I don't know, I'll just see what they have for lunch, and then I'll decide from my options. how does that sound? Uhh. and our elevator doesn't work. oh ya! There's another elevator. I walked three flights of stairs for nothing then? OH well. good exercise right? I didn't realize we had two elevators because I always just take the one I'm used to, but it's ""temporarily out of order. "" Does that mean the other one will be out of order too? Hmm. I'll go see. ok. I guess that's about it. Maybe I should start another diary. I finished the first one I had. I've had it since I was about 12. It's kind of funny looking back at all the things I wrote about. ",1
715,"I just got up and now I have to finish all these dumb writing assignments. I haven't taken a shower yet, and I'm not really in the mood to finish these things, but they're due tomorrow, so I have to finish these. I think I'm going to go workout later today. I want to be in shape for the crew team. I've noticed myself getting a lot better like being in better cardiovascular shape. that's cool. I haven't played soccer in a while, so it feels good doing something athletic again. hopefully, I'll get in some major shape in not too long. I still have so much homework to do. this really sucks. This weekend was pretty fun I guess. We went to this Iron Spikes party friday night. There were some pretty cute girls there. I almost went home with one girl but I don't think she is that cute. I did have some pretty thick beer goggles on so I don't really know if she was as good looking as I thought. OH well. That just shows my dedication to crew. IF I give up getting some, then being on the crew team must be very important to me. I felt like I was in too. This girl was just absolutely digging me. that's a shame. and then on saturday, I went to a lakehouse, that was a) neither a on a lake b) not even a house. it was a freakin stream-creek apartment. that sucked. These girls that were there were pretty annoying. ONe was really cute, but she was kinda snobbish. I dunno. I'd like to talk to her, but these girls were all too snobbish for me. I was hoping maybe there would be some down to earth girls but apparently not. I hope I meet a good girl pretty soon. I want a girlfriend, but I think I'm trying too hard. I should just chill and hopefully one will bite me in the butt soon. Oh My God! I still have a few minutes to go here, but this is taking forever. Let's see. i have economics, calculus, chemistry, and then of course this class. I kinda want to just stop and go workout and then go out tonight to makeup for that bunk night last night. It sucked. We were supposed to spend the night there last night, but we ended up going home, because quite frankly, it sucked. we didn't do anything, but drink and then just talk. These girls would talk about absolutely nothing. they had no brains. just a bunch of hot air. it was so very boring talking to them. hopefully next week though, it will get a LOT better. I mean it only goes up from here. that was absolutely horrible. I am not in the mood to do any homework at all. ",0
1292,"For some reason today I feel more home sick than I have yet. When I first arrived to my dorm room three weeks ago, it didn't feel very real to me. Of course I cried when my parents left, but it wasn't because I was feeling all the things that I thought I would. At the time I think it was more knowing that I would soon feel that way once the excitement wore off. Now, dorm life is very real and I no longer feel like I am at summer camp. The first two weeks were nothing but meeting new people and going new places and now I feel the overwhelming feeling of college work and homesickness. It is rather silly I guess for me to say ""homesick"" because I am only thirty miles away from home, but I have discovered that it doesn't really matter what your distance from home is. Distance would make it harder, but for all of us it is the fact that we are no longer living with our families; we will never be living under our parents permanently. In a way I guess I am supposed to be really excited about that and I think I am, but I also really miss being a bigger part of their lives. So much happens on a daily basis and I feel like I am missing something. I also wonder if it is really weird for me to feel this way. So many of the other students seem to be having the time of their lives, but I wonder if they have ever felt the same way. I went to eat with my mom and sisters last night because my older sister was in town from College Station. After we ate I couldn't fight the tears that were welling up in my eyes. I miss old times like that and I miss the way we could just laugh together and have fun. I know that soon I will be adjusted to my new life and I can look back on this and think what a dork I was. It is just that time of adjustment and waiting until this place feels like home. I want so badly for it to feel like home and I want to be happy here. I really have no doubt that it soon will be a place where I feel comfortable, I just hope that soon comes really soon! My mom keeps sending emails telling me to have fun. It isn't that easy to just make friends and go have fun. I never thought that it would be so hard to meet people, but with such a huge population it can't be easy. I think that I am probably complaining too much because I really am not unhappy by any means but I just expected something different. High expectations are dangerous because nothing can ever be as good as you dream it to be. Oh well, hook 'em horns! ",0
686,"Right now I am sitting in front of the computer, completing this assignment. I really wish that I had worked on this assignment earlier. I am now starting to worry because I have to finish Calculus homework and read a few pages for Engineering. And I have to finish that one problem that no one can seem to get. It is bugging me that I left that one problem unfinished. It is also bugging me that I left that problem blank and completed the others out of turn. I never thought about that before, but I do get bothered when things aren't completed in the order that they're supposed to be. Weird. I just had an epiphany. It is really weird how you think of things at the strangest time. Whats also weird is how you can sometimes say a word over and over, and if you say it enough times it starts to sound really weird. Like a word you've never heard before. Take before. Before Before Before Before Before Before. see, it starts to sound really foreign. That is really odd. And it works with every word, too. Hmm. thoughts are all scrambled now. Not thinking of much anymore. I used to think of how much I missed home. now it is not so prominent. I don't think of Roshi as much. I still do sometimes. But it comes and goes. I am not going to let myself get trapped like I have before. It is just a vicious cycle. I feel much better this time. I have somehow learned to overcome sadness. I dunno exactly how it happened, but I have learned to overcome and bypass it. It doesn't consume me anymore like it used to. Now that I think about it, I am really starting to wonder how I managed to do that. Inherently, I think that I can get fixated easily;  that right there is a sign that I am bound to get hurt one of these days. And I have. but I have learned. The question is, how?  Hmm. oh well. No matter now. As long as I can do it. That is good enough for me. Maybe its the college atmosphere. Being alone and on my own. In a sense, anyway. I look around my room and realize that I do not miss home. I don't know why. I missa family and friends at time, but I don't MISS them. Its weird. Maybe its because I don't consider myself away from them. Mysha said that this was like a camping trip, and everytime we went home was no different than coming back from a vacation. Hmm. i don't think thats so, but it certainly didn't feel too different on Labor Day. Maybe I need to stay away from home longer. Hmm. that must be it. Mysha got me thinking about Roshi again. Hmm. makes me wonder how easy it is to meet people here. It can't be too hard;  lots of people have already met people. I jsut need to go and try. Steve knows how to do it, but he has nothing to lose, he has a girlfriend at home so he doesn't care much about making a lot of friends. Comes natural to him though. I honestly think that that is the only thing really bugging me here. I feel an immense sense of confidence, all except for that. I am liking the way I am handling things, liking the way I have kinda built back my work ethic, and liking the fact that I can make my own decisions. I am starting to feel better and better about college life. It is great. Except for all the people. There is something srange about the people here, something difficult to finger. A sort of fakeness. Many people are geniune, but there are others which seem unapproachable. People don't act the way I am used to seeing them act in high school. Maybe that is it. Asians don't act like Asians at home, for one thing. Most other people act the same, but the Asians here don't. A little different. a little meaner?  That can't be it though, I really need to meet more and judge. Ugh. i feel like I've just cursed myself for saying that. I really didn't mean that. I am being too cynical I guess. But you can't win them all. I am happy otherwise;  I have met a few good friends, I like the campus, and I am close to home. I feel connected in all aspects. UT was probably one of the best choices I ever made. My Dad thinks so. he told me the other night. I always hated when he judges whats good and bad based on what he thought, but he is right this time. He usually is, I've learned. Almost always. I need to learn to respect that. I'm the one who's usually wrong. Oh well. Better late than never. Time for Calculus. ",0
2102,"I'm thinking that this is a crazy assignment. It's only been 17 seconds, I have a long way to go. My stupid brother keeps instant messaging me, I wish he would go away. There's a menu on my desk to a sandwich place we went to yesterday, that was pretty good. I wonder what we'll eat tonight. I'm tired of Jester Pizza. It's really not that good. Now it's only been a minute and 37 seconds. 40 seconds. Stupid kid keeps I'M-ing me. Good now he signed off. My roommate is reading the fourth Harry Potter book and I can hear her turning the pages. She is also drinking something and sipping really loudly, which is really getting annoying, but I don't know if I should say anything about it because that would probably be construed as rude and it's awfully early in the year to have her mad at me already. I've been chewing this gum for about an hour now and it's almost completely lost it's flavor. My sandal just fell off and I wonder where it went. My roommate stopped sipping whatever it was. I think it was soup. Who drinks soup out of a cup?  Aren't you supposed to use a spoon?  Maybe we're  out of spoons. That's no good. I'm going home this weekend so maybe I'll get my mom to buy us some new spoons. My phone is ringing and I'm pretty sure it's my ex-boyfriend Keith but I'm not going to answer it. I'll probably tell him it's because I'm writing this, but I really just don't feel like talking to him right now. His new relationship is probably not going well and he probably wants to talk about it so we can get back together, but I don't really want to. I don't like being the plan B. I don't think it's very fair. The page scrolled down enough that I can't see how much time has passed. I'm thinking maybe like 5 minutes. Does this thing stop when it's 20 minutes?  Now my roommate is writing something. My foot kind of hurts where my shoe rubbed on the way to psychology class. Probably wasn't a smart choice of shoes. Oh well. I wonder when that water bottle is from. Yesterday I think. My printer has a blue button. I'm getting kind of bored of this and I don't really like to type. I hate e-mail and instant message and all that garbage. Why can't people just call you on the phone?  It's so much easier and then you hear the tone in their voice and know if they're being sarcastic or not. Sarcasm is completely lost in the electronic communication system thingy. Now I'm staring at the wall. It's a painted brick kind of wall, which is probably smart of whoever designed this place, but it sucks if you want to hang stuff up. We tacked a bunch of posters up everywhere. My best friend Kristyn got a bunch of them for me. Too bad she is not here. We're going out to dinner tomorrow night, no the night after. Anyway, Friday night is when we're going out to dinner. I haven't seen her in a week, which I'm sure doesn't sound like a long time, but she used to be my neighbor when I lived at my parents house so I'm still kind of used to seeing her everyday. She is going to go to massage therapy school somewhere around here. I always forget the name of it, but it's supposed to be not very far away from campus. Now my hand is starting to hurt from typing all this crap. I think if I reread this, I'd probably think I was crazy. All of this is pretty random. I want the phone to ring because now I'm in the mood to talk to him. He is not very nice sometimes, but sometimes he really is. I think this is probably a bad situation. He wants us to be friends. He is a good friend, he is just not very good at being anything more than friends. He is not a very good people person I guess. My roommate is rolling around in her bed, it's kind of distracting. I have a pencil from the greensheet and I don't remember where I got or who could have possibly left it here. Where did it come from?  Do people actually read the greensheet?  I've never seen someone reading it. Kinda weird. My mom works for the Austin American Statesman, but she doesn't write or take pictures or anything like that, she works in HR. Time must be almost up. Ha, it does tell me when this is over! ",1
2243,"This is weird and different. I'm not exactly sure what I should be writing. I really love it when guys can play the guitar. I don't know what it is but guys who play the guitar are my biggest weakness. I hope, oh I forgot what I was going to say. that happens a lot. Twenty minutes seems like a long time. Anyway, I'm listening to Hotel California by The Eagles and then I think I'm going to listen to my Sublime Cd. The Beatles were like musical geniuses. I bet them and Frank Sinatra are the celebrities that got the most sex from random women. I would have had sex with Frank Sinatra back in the day. I made a list of celebrities I would have no problems having sex with- it isn't very long but I'll share it because I really don't care. It's not like I'll ever have sex with these people anyway let's see it was Lindsay Lohan, Michael Vartan, John Mayer, and Jake Gyllenhaal. I bet John Mayer is an excellent lover. No one who plays the guitar (and sings wonderful love songs) with that much emotion and feeling is a bad lover. Huh, I don't think that made sense, it made sense in my head. I'm so glad Stephie is my roommate. We have our differences but for the most part we get a long so well. Sex and the City is such an awesome show. I think each woman has a little bit of all four of the girls in them. Is it bad that sometimes I want to push my morals aside and do things I know are ""wrong"". Since I've gotten here my friends that go to other schools are bashing my new life style. I hate that they judge me. Why can't I just live my life the way I want to? Being active in the church youth group in high school was one of the best things I've ever done but now that I'm doing things that The Church wouldn't approve of I'm noticing that I'm pushing everything I used to stand for aside so that I can ""experiment"" with different things. I don't regret anything I do, but sometimes I don't think I make the best decisions. I'm happy though and I guess that's all that matters. I'm sure God is an understanding God. I'm not sure what's worse living my life as a straight edge or being taken up by the flashiness of college life. sounds like a lose lose situation to me. I really need to lose some weight man. I was sitting in the hookah bar tonight and this girl said she lost 73 pounds in a year and that she used to weigh 210. So now she weighs. 137. wow. I need to lose that much weight. I wonder how she did it. I should have asked her. some days I'll feel really self confident and pretty and I'm like well I guess I love myself the way I am so someone will love me for me as well. Then other days I'm like ""fuck, who's going to love a fat slob"". I hope I meet the one in college. I hope he's amazing in every way. Is it too much to ask to meet my soul mate? That would be sweet. First things first though. I need to shed the pounds ASAP. yes. After this I have to study Italian. That's going to suck. I probably should have done that instead of sleeping the day away. oh well. This week was a lot more productive then last. So this weekend I plan to really catch up and get my shit together. I really need to pull my GPA up. I want to do good. I'm going to do good. I just wish I weren't so damn lazy. Bah. I wish I were going to college station tomorrow. I want to see my old friends but I don't know why if they're just going to look at me like I'm the devil. My leg is still twitching. That probably isn't a good thing. I'm sad pookie's leaving this weekend. I wish I could find someone who enjoys my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I miss Chris so much. I wish every time I was with him could be like that night after the John Mayer concert. he's so much fun to be around. I think I come off as bitchy and annoying but I'm not sure. I wish someone would tell me. I have the Beatles song ""Black bird"" stuck in my head. I want to take guitar lessons I just wish they weren't so damn expensive. I'm so glad I only have one class tomorrow! Yay! I kind of don't want to go to the welcome retreat thing but maybe it will be for the better. Otherwise looks like I will be going to college station. We'll see how that works out. ",0
305,"  I am so glad that I came home this weekend. I really miss all of my friends and family. I feel like I need to be studying for some of my classes right now. I want to but I also want to spend time with my family. I need to go shopping today. I still need to buy an answering machine and some shower shoes. I really like UT, but I just feel so lonely sometimes. I am so used to being in high school and seeing all of my friends every day. I am so used to being able to ask any of them for help with homework when I needed it. I really miss them. Now most of them have gone so far away and I won't see them for a long time. I am so happy that I got to see Vicky yesterday. I had not seen her in a long time, but it is almost as if I had never left. I can't believe all the things that she told me yesterday that I had never knew before. I am nervous about going back to class on Tuesday. I am so afraid that I am not going to do well in college, but I really want to . I feel like I am already behind because I have alot to do. I am starting to get hungry now. I haven't eaten all day and my stomach is starting to hurt. I can't believe that Princess Diana died. It is so hard to believe. I feel so bad for her kids. I feel like I have so much to do today, but I don't know where to start. I am so tired. I want to go back to sleep. I want to go out and do something tonight. I haven't gone out in so long, and I am tired of staying home every night. I don't want to sit at home and watch TV again. I wonder if mom and dad are going to go somewhere again tonight. I hope that they don't. I would rather them just stay home with me. I wonder why Michael is acting so weird. Sometimes he is nice to me, but then sometimes he won't even talk to me. I really donÃ¯Â¿Â½t want to buy anything today. I have been spending so much money and I feel like I am running out. Maybe mom and dad will help me out and pay for a few things. I wish that the rest of my friends were here. I really miss them. When me and Vicky were talking about them yesterday, it made me miss them even more. Now I am feeling like I was on Friday. I was in such a dreary mood because I felt so alone. I wish I could see more people that I knew at UT. I wish that my parents would stop nagging me all of the time. Sometimes I feel that I can never do anything to please them. I ready to go back to Austin. I canÃ¯Â¿Â½t study when I am at home. There are too many thing to distract me from doing it. I am really hungry now. I think that I will go and get something to eat. ",1
209,"In the background there is the movie ""Space Jam"" which is a little distracting. I can't help but focus on the comedy the Looney Tunes attribute to communication disorders because it was a topic that was discussed in my CSD class. It's a little too cold in here. My agent is not paying enough attention to me as of late, in agreement with a statement just made in the movie. I still wonder about my sign language assignment tonight. The screen on this computer is getting out of focus, then coming back in focus again. I love this keyboard. The spacing on the keys is wonderful. I wish my face would stop throbbing. My lips are very dry, and it's still very cold. I can feel the fatness in the side of my face from my surgery. the Newman guy on Seinfeld is in this movie. I hate his character. In Seinfeld he's funny at least. this music reminds me of aerobics and now the Eagles are playing ""Fly Like and Eagle"". Michael Jordan is a very attractive man. I wish I lived on campus. I wish I had a boyfriend. I gave the wrong number to my friend. It's hard to pay attention to the assignment and the movie , but it's not my computer so I must make do. no more basketball this season. I love this song, it reminds me of 5th grade and going roller skating. My best friend from 5th grade was really messed up. I wonder where she is now. I need to get the old school Salt 'n Peppa CD. I want a new car. I really want a nice car, not another piece of crap like I already have. I want a new Honda Accord, if life was perfect. I'm glad, this boy is coming over and I am very attracted to him. the movie with Kevin Bacon in it about basketball. I forgot the name, crap. my head hurts. you know that looking at anything that is emitting light, like a computer screen or a TV with the lights off it is very bad for your eyes. I'm hungry, I need to work out. I love the free rec center. My fingers hurt a little. I love playing sports, I love movies. I want to make movies when I get older, maybe I'll just produce. Actually I want to be rich. God, that mouse is annoying. Reminds me of my little sister, she always talks to fast for her mouth. This movie sucks. I am tired and I have to do that stupid Lab tonight. I want to go to an amusement park. I'm hungry. I miss Karen. I need a haircut. God that's Danny Devito's voice. That trips me out. OK , my fingers really hurt. the chubby boy? Who's voice is that? hey time really flies, it's good to hear Jenny laugh. I love it when other people are amused. Why is Michael talking about his butt. My friend Justin called me, it's very cool that I ran into him today. enough. ",1
1375,"I'm starting to write this at six twenty five, It's really cold in this computer lab, I wish they would turn the air conditioner down, do they know how to do that, would they do it if I asked them, probably not, but I wish they would, there sure is a lot of typing noise going on in the room, no one is talking, I am thinking more things that I am actually typing, it is really hard to write everything that I think and I type a lot slower that my brain thinks thoughts, thoughts, thoughts, thoughts, I am not thinking of much right now, the professor is going to think my writing is dumb if he reads it, he probably won't read it though, and he probably won't really think it is dumb, there are probably students who write dumber ones than me. I am horrible at typing, I am making all kinds of mistakes, I hope I can read this a when I finish it, or else there will be a problem, brrrr It's really cold in here, I sure wish they would make it warmer. My fingers and my feet are freezing, and I'm already bad enough at typing, the cold makes it even harder to type, geeze I'm going to have to do a lot of spell checking after I finish this, I only have about ten minutes of typing left, I just heard someone's cell phone ring and they are not supposed to have cell phones in this computer lab, I always hear phones ring in here anyways, I wonder if anyone ever gets in trouble for that, they should turn their phones off, so they don't disrupt other people, even though personally it doesn't bother me if I hear a phone ring but I guess if nobody turned theirs off then they would all be ringing all the time and then all the ringing would get annoying, gosh I can't spell worth anything, I'm hardly going to be able to read this when I get done, I hope I can decipher it, my feet are freezing, I keep repeating the same thoughts over and over but maybe that's the point of this exercise that you think a lot of things and many of them are repeated. I wonder if its raining outside, that sure was a random thought that came out of nowhere, I wonder why I thought of that, hhhmmm, I saw all the clouds earlier outside, it was really dark and scary looking, I hope it rains a lot more, more than yesterday, it didn't rain enough yesterday, I love when it rains, it's better than the sunshine, I wonder if that means I'm a negative person, it can't though cause I am such a positive and optimistic person, well at least I think of myself as optimistic, I try to be optimistic but sometimes its hard, like last week I was so stressed out with all the band stuff, I'm really glad I quit band cause it was too hard but it was hard deciding to quit too, I wonder if anybody in band misses me, I wonder if any of the guys had secret crushes on me, I hope some of them did, but I guess that's not a good thing to hope considering I have a boyfriend, I really miss my boyfriend a lot, and I just thought about macaroni and cheese for some weird reason, I wonder why I thought of that, maybe cause both me and my boyfriend like macaroni and cheese, I'm such a horrible typist, this typing is probably the worse I've ever done, I only have a couple of minutes left to go, gosh time really went but fast since I was just typing anything I thought, I wonder if the professor will really read this, he is a really cool professor, I like him a lot, but now if he does read this he's probably going to think I was sucking up to him but that's not true cause I really love psychology, that's a hard word to spell, well its not hard but it takes a little time to think about how it's spelled, I remember when I was in the spelling bee in 4th grade, I think it was fourth grade, maybe it was third, I remember my ex best friend who was in my third grade class, I didn't really know her then but now she is really stupid but I don't really want to think about that right now and my twenty minutes is up so I guess I'll stop typing! ",1
1620,"    I know this guy that lies. When I met him, he lies about himself to fit in. Being the gullible person that I am, I believed all of his lies. After all, they're not that absurd--maybe they are. He said he worked at Best Buy when he was fourteen and had a cell phone. He said he was the on call technical support personnel. Dan Nguyen and I still teases him about that. I guess because of that, I didn't believe he got a new car when he actually did. His car is quite a looker. I wish my car is like that. It just needs a lot of work. Perhaps more money is needed than work. I need to work to get money. I have no idea when or where should I be working. I think the work load of UT is enough to stress me out without working. If I work, then my free time will be taken away from me. I really cherish my free time; I could work out at the gym or play video games. Something I never had free time to do. Well I also have to read a lot of materials for my classes. Today is September the 11th--one week from my birthday. I hate my birthday. Bad luck always happen on that day. on my 17th birthday I got my first speeding ticket. Three days later, I wrecked my car totally. September of 2001 was the worst month of my life. I guess I always expect to be happy on my birthday since it's supposed to be a good day. Maybe that's why it seemed even worse when everything wasn't going my way. I love my friends. They're people who really care about me and my life. I do the same for them. I, however, do have a problem with keeping girls as just friends. In my opinion, friends of the opposite sex who don't really care about your life are just as bad as some person you had a small talk in the elevator. The only reason I have those so-called friends is because they're my buddies' friends. We belonged in a clique, a group, if you will, back in high school. I don't like the idea of a   group  . Maybe things will change as life goes on. My roommate, Jeff, and I were best friends in high school. We are roommates for almost a month now, and we haven't made each other mad. I guess that's a good sign. I heard about stories about sour relationships over something stupid. I have a mello personality. I can compromise.      ",0
2444,"I do not feel well at all, I wonder if it was the tequila from last night or worrying about a girl. Sometimes I don't know why I am still with her. Can you still have feelings for someone that you find annoying? Why am I doing this Writing Assignment now my stomach and head are killing me. I should have tried to pawn it off on one of my roommates for ten dollars or something because who wants to right about what ""they"" think, I'm more interested in what other people think about. I mean I alrdy know what I think about, its boring to me, what about the people I don't know, what do they think about, that's what I want to know. I know that girl down there is thinking about something, some psycologist needs to figure out how to read girls, that's what they should be working on, why learn about depression, figure out what girls think about. Honestly, I don't think a single man can tell me what a girl is thinking at any given time, half the time they hate you other half they love you and it can switch just as fast. What's the deal with that!  I am still feeling bad my stomach won't stop hurting, I think I need to get something to eat. I need to get feeling better cause I already have plans for tonight, and it sucks going out when you don't feel well. When I go out and I don't feel well, I get extremely annoyed with everyone that I am with. It's probably because they are having more fun then I am. I have noticed that school is obsessed with talking about politics, in every class I go to we talk about Bush and Kerry. YES, 3 more minutes to go on the assignment, but too much politics in my opinion half the time it has no correlation with the subject at hand. In my Spanish class we had a 30 minute discussion about economic poilices, how does that help me with Hola Como estas? This assignment isn't bad, its like the people that have journals, who put there mind on paper.      ",0
1041,"Ok, twenty minutes has started. Well, I feel like I'm trying to keep up with everything, hoping I don't forget some meeting or instruction session I was supposed to go to. I'm thinking I really like UT so far and I feel I'm where I need to be. I miss my puppy, he's the cutest Dalmatian in the worldI named him Tex. He's my little childI taught him how to give me five! I wish I could go see some of my brother and sister's games, I'm sure they are kicking some butt. I've been thinking about the long distance relationship I'm in, and wondering if maybe I would like to date other people. I mean, he's already been to college, and had his fun, so I think I would like to just date people, but how do you say that to someone? Oh well, he's in Hawaii for two weeks, so whatever happens while he's outside of the continental U. S. doesn't count, right? Just kidding. I'm glad that I came to Austin, I get to see my grandmother a lot, and we've always been close, so that's good. I'm surprised that my roommate and I are getting along so well. We've known each other for a long time, and I had anticipated some problems, but so far we are just peachy. I have a feeling or two to share I hate Linguistics! I was worried about taking my Spanish class because it's upper division, and it has been awhile since I was as sharp with it as when I took the AP test, but I'm loving it. Glad I've been working out lately I love that feeling. This is the first year I will not be playing competitive volleyball, and I am definitely suffering from withdrawals. Kind of makes me wish I had gone somewhere small to play. When I look at it though, I think I made the right decision. Even though my parents thought my room was disgustingly little, I am really liking dorm life. This is cool. I want an apartment next year so I can bring lil Tex down with me. Speaking of feelings, I hate the phrase ""Is it hot enough for ya?"" If someone says that to me one more time Whoops, I guess this isn't a pet peeve writing assignment. The sensations that I have been feeling lately are sensations of extreme heat whenever I step outside! I loved this country place we went to the other night, even though it was far from country. Twostepping reminds me of my ex who is still calling. I plan to work out at least 4 times a week now, I'm just so sick of being the group fatty. My friend and I were talking about how we don't have any ugly friends, which I guess is good and bad. Good because, I guess being cute always is, and bad, because that means lots of competition! :) I just don't want to be the biggest one anymore. That whole last tangent makes no sense to me, so I'm sure if you choose to read this line, it will make none to you either. Well, my 20's up! Hope it was good reading!  ",1
1106,"Well hello there, I just decided to start my writing assignment. I'm bored since my roommate, Travis, for class so I decided to do this assignment today. I hope it isn't boring. It seems like an easy assignment, and since I'm not the best writer I'm grateful. I'm not the best typist either. It's a lot different typing something to hand in compared to typing to your friends online. My nose hurts and I'm tired. My throat tastes bad too. Hmmm what else. This is kind of a weird assignment. I have too many thoughts to write them all down, and I can't type fast enough. I'm struggling here as it is. For every thought I write down, a couple more are being wasted because of my bad typing skills. I keep having to go back and fix all of my typos. I have to call my friend today. I'll do it after I'm done with this. I saw a funny download about some coffee bean that was like the matrix. I liked it a lot, but I can't find the site where he got it, so I guess I have to call him. Also I didn't call him back last night either. I'm using the idea where you type it in notepad first then you paste it to the web, but I'm not sure if it's coming out the right way. I don't want to do this again, so I hope it works. I have to go turn down the air cause it's freezing in here, I can barely feel my fingers. There, it feels better already. I wonder what George is doing now too. He went out with me last night. I don't have anymore classes today, and I want to do something cool. I do have to do laundry. I'm not sure if that is how you spell it though. The bag is getting big and smelly. I have to clean before my old girlfriend visits. She is very nice and beautiful. I'm mad because we broke up. Long distance relationships don't work, but we still liked each other a lot. So far I haven't seen any girls here that I want to go out with. I'm not sure if it's because I really like Laura still or because my standards are a lot higher now. This is kind of fun just telling you everything, I'm doing my best now not to remember something really embarrassing that I would have to type to you. I think this is what a diary or journal would be like if I decided to keep one. I always wanted to do that, but I don't have the time. In second grade our class had to do one and draw pictures of our day too. I liked doing it and I tried to keep doing it but it just wasn't the same. I just lost the motivation to do it. It's always fun to read my old second grade one though. I was such a dork back then though. Not that I'm Mr. Popular now though. It sucks here because at high school I knew everyone and had lots of friends. Now I still have some of my friends but it will take sometime before I know what's happening on the weekends. I still really want to meet a girl here, but I just haven't seen any that I really like. I just don't want to go up to random girls and ask for their number either. Personally I think I'm selling our if I do that. I'm not sure why but I feel stupid, like I'm trying to be somebody that I'm not. I just glanced at the clock and I have about a minute left so I'm going to stop now. I'm pretty impressed with my work here. I hope you like it, if you read it. ",0
2133,"I can't stop sniffling. I don't even know if that's how you spell it. I'm so pissed off that I'm getting sick. I guess that's what happens when you live in a dorm. I better not get some crazy disease though. I probably won't. Should I finish my homework? Or should I just pass out. I would prefer to do that latter. My bio 211 class sucks a lot of balls. The professor I think is just TRYING to sound intimidating, and if that is the case, then she is doing a really good job at it. Man, I really really want to be a doctor. I'm not as smart as everyone else. Things don't just come to me. I have to work for it. This may, in the end, work in my favor, being that if I(and hopefully I will)succeed, I will feel all the more complacent. But that's just wishful thinking. I'm really going to stop with the caring about capitalization. when I type emails I never capitalize my I's--well I just did. but that's different. there was this guy I one knew that always made me feel stupid if I didn't spell things right. I know how to spell. and I believe he knew I knew how to spell, but I think he took some kind of pleasure in my feelings of inferiority. perhaps, I will always feel that way when I am around him. well it hasn't stopped for about 5 years now. who would have thought that we would end up at the same university. I mean I know it's not a big deal, being that UT is enormous and all, but he is not going to escape me--I wish I want him to escape me. but I don't. that's not good at all. what a jerk. I mean ok, well he is not really a jerk,"" but I always feel like he is messing with my mind. maybe I'm just the one that's screwed up. I think I am. I'm really glad I didn't seem him today. I needed a break from all that. good break from it right? here I am in my ""stream of consciousness"" talking about it. I don't know if I spelled that C word write either--but who the hell cares right?        wow--I'm really glad it didn't push Finish on me there. sometimes that happens. that would have really sucked because I have already spent 8 min and 47sec typing this. I kinda like typing. it makes me feel pretty cool. thank goodness I'm a fast typer. if I wasn't, things like this would really suck. (I'm trying not to say 'suck balls') --now I'm laughing. I don't know where I got that expression from. maybe it was my sister. yes, yes, I have a TWIN sister. ohhh ahhh. a twin? does she look like you? are ya'll identical?  blah blah. yes yes and no. the end. if I spoke anymore about this and this is in some way published before the class, there would a better hint as to who the writer of this stream of consciousness is. it's alright. not that I mind. I miss my nephew. he is the cutest thing in the world. I miss when he would try to say ""bob the builder. "" what a cutie! he learned to say my boyfriend's name before he learned to say my own name--yeah I was a little upset at first,  but it's really no big deal. I am glad he has a solid man-figure in his life. the boyfriend's a good role model and he obviously loves my nephew very much--oops just sneezed. wow and sorry the phone's ringing. I can't be mean and be like hey I'm typing this stream of consciousness thingy. ok that's over, and I just realized that the spelling of consciousness has been at the heading of this page the whole time. I am a genius. beautiful. well I was spelling it right--that's good. man, sometimes I start to think in spanish. that's cool isn't it. I kinda like that. I wish I could speak fluently though. it would make things a lot a lot easier. I really do want to go to spain. it's on my list of things to do in my life, along with help others, become a pediatrician, and give back. I love my major. I'm so glad I chose it. we had a great discussion today about poverty and things of that nature. I am definitely a democrat but that doesn't mean I'm some liberal. liberals get such a bad wrap--it's not true. you know what else gets a bad wrap? jester. jester really isn't that bad. to me, when people complain about jester, they just sound really really spoiled. I know that's judgmental but oh well. I love how it's really social. that's how I met one of my really good friends here. we were in our HORRIBLE community bath --no it's not really horrible-- and that's how we met. she is really cool, from out of state. time's almost up. adios amigo. ",1
1608,"     I'm in a state of confusion. I'm in a library just staring at people as they walk through the door. I'm feeling sleepy, just sitting in front of a computer deliriously. My nose is stuffed up but I can still smell. I smell some type of perfume, not so great nor so bad. I'm feeling nervous, feeling like there is someone watching every bit of move I make. The wall is very white with few uninteresting posters, there are a lot of people but yet. so quiet. I feel like I'm dreaming, just sleep walking my way around. I feel nervous about everything that surrounds me. I sense the air full of intelligence and suffering from the people(student's) minds. As I type, I still feel nervous and confused about everything. I feel cold, mainly the lower body, it feels as if I am in a water full of ice. It's somewhat painful and somewhat a numb feeling. I suddenly start to notice the sounds of people clicking the mouse on the computer and I hear myself type as I stroke the keyboard with force and precision. I see a lot of books, mostly thick covered: don't know what they are used for though. The desk is filthy as if it had never been cleaned, it's full of dusts and paper wads. I feel lonely simply because I'm sitting alone but then again everyone else is sitting by themselves. I see  a person staring at a book calmly as he stretches. Everything around this place seems strange even myself. It seems as if everyone is just here to kill time. They are just here to amuse themselves. Perhaps I'm talking about myself. ",0
2043,"Don't get me wrong UT is great but there's still something missing: my girl, Maria. Sometimes life just don't make sense. One minute you're the king the next you're down in the gutter. Man I wish I was still with my girl, or shall I say ex. Things are messed up. All cause of family nagging and distance, the whole thing fell through. The hell with this ?oh college is awesome, so many chicks? crap. I had a girl who was good looking, not a ho, who was caring, who was intelligent, and loved me. Thanks to all these circumstances though outside my control, the break up took place, or rather the ?time off? as she put it. What's 230 miles got to do with it? Too bad she is a year younger or that I'm a year older. Things aren't fair in life. Speaking of bad things, my step father has been having problems with his kidneys recently. He started dialysis today back home in Eagle Pass. Funny how me and him used to be at each other's throat but over the last two to three years we bonded and got pretty close. I miss the bastard. It was weird seeing him cry the day that I left. Here was this macho tough guy crying over his step son leaving for college. My mom didn't fair much better either. She had the water works going. That was the toughest part of leaving town. I won't miss Eagle Pass much. Just some of the people I left behind, Maria included. Things change, I went down to watch a Eagle Pass football game last week. It was against our border rivals Del Rio. Trust me these two towns hate each other. They did a lot of talking but we still won the game by 11. Damn I say we like if I played or something. Anyways we beat them down last year by 11 in their place too. Good old? Del Rio, always an easy win. Austin is cool, but man there seems to me there's not many folks like me. All the white people seem to be afraid of me or something. Look in class sometime. I sit way in the back in seat 7 front row and there's always seats next to me open. If someone actually sits down its cause there's no where else to sit. I don't bite and I do shower. I guess people tend to hang with their kind. My kind doesn't exist here. The Hispanics here don't accept their heritage, most anyways. They either want to be white or black. I can't go up to them and say something like ?Que Onda? cause they DON'T know Spanish. Its messed up. My Spanish is decent but I look like a god compared to some of the Hispanics here. Oh well I'm glad that at least my roommate is my friend from my home town. At least we can still ?cag? it together. It's a Tex-Mex term from Eagle Pass, basically meaning to joke around and act stupid. I'll tell you more about the origin another day. Oh yeah Cowboys suck. Come on pull it together men! Win one for the gipper, do something. The team played horribly in the second half. Hope they do better next week on Monday Night Football. Man this is crazy. My foot itches, damn athlete's foot. Should get something for it. Typing late at night is fun. I need to go download the new Obie Trice Album, too bad its only on Mirc right now and I can't get it yet. In due time I suppose. I still have yet to find out how truly hard college life is so far. My roommate has a test today and he spent the whole day yesterday studying like a mad man. I'm glad I'm not taking any science course this semester. Life is good though. Small problems aside I don't have much to complain about other than Calculus, but I'll be fine with it. ",1
1179,"this assignment should be interesting but at the same time inhibited my slow typing. I do not like to use computers especially the internet. I had such problems on the internet when I was applying to ut that I almost did not get in because of them. but I am here now and happy. the one thing I am surprised about at ut is that there aren't more blacks or persons of color. I guess that is just the way things go. there are a lot of other ethnicities represented here though. my high school graduating class of 100 had 6 minorities in it. ut is a bit of a change. but for the better I am sure. my high school on Houston was private and some would venture to say snobby. I agree but a lot of times it was nice being in a homogeneous world. it reminds me of our country club in Houston. 1000 memberonly wasp. it is really not all that bad, though from a member's perspective. I like being one in a big heard of the same type of people. that is why I joined a fraternity up here at ut. it is fun and a good way to meet girls and guysmostly whom are white. I totally understand, value, and enjoy the perspectives of minorities though. last year in a history discussion class there was a Hispanic girl and she brought so many unique and amazing perspectives to the table although most of them had to do with religious based ideas. Speaking of religion I need to get some while I am up here in college. nobody has enough time for religions up here it seems but wouldn't that be so much better if they did. I find religion to be the best thing on the face of the earth although I do not get or have enough. the problem is it is difficult to do so and the results are not as immediate as a good grade on a test or anything else you work hard for. I miss my home church but I will probably end up going back there. I probably will end up moving back to Houston when all of my schooling is done. just like my dad and his dad's dad. I am a 7th generation Harris county resident and that makes me happy. I wonder how many times I have used the word 'I' in this writing. how many minutes have I written for only five to go. I might be a slow typist. never could type to well. not good hand eye coordination. my brother has good hI coordination. my wisdom teeth hurt and I need to get them removed or just take some more Advil. speaking of Advil and the thing that I thought I would be using them the most for, hangovers, I don't even drink half as much up here at school as I did back in high school. maybe that is a good thing. 2 more minutes. my hands are a bit sore. what to write or think about. today was a good day I hope that that girl I met at dinner tonight has an interest in me and not my friend Michael. she said she liked Michael. He has a girl friend though who is coming to town soon. I bet she is good looking ",0
2210,"So I'm not sure on what I'm supposed to be typing about. What I smell, taste, feel like??? Well I'm chewing gum. I've been chewing it for over like 3 hours now. I hate it when gum starts to get really hard in your mouth. My gum got hard a long time ago. But somehow the flavor is still intact. It's weird though- like with some gum, the flavor is gone after you chew it for like literally 2 minutes. However, I've noticed that Wrigley's chewing gum tends to have flavor for a very long time. There are many pictures on my wall. I stuck all these pics up like 2 days ago. There are pictures of my friends, one of my dog, and one of me and my sis. I don't have one of my family up there. I kind of feel bad in a way. But I don't think it's necessary to have them up on the board. I have a picture of them in my drawer if I ever need to see them. But I think it's better with them in my drawer. Every time I look up at these pictures of all my friends, I miss them like no other. Man, I had so much fun last year, in high school in general. But last year was definitely the best year. Man, me, Caroline, and Shaheen in government and Spanish. Those were some good times. I kind of even miss my teachers. And our elephants and doing SCN all the time. We have so many inside jokes. And although I'm sure I'll see Caroline again, I'm afraid that when I meet her things won't be the same. And for some reason I'm scared of that. I hope I can go to LSU in the spring. Or actually, I hope Caroline can come to Houston for Thanksgiving. Or both would be the best. And we can't forget about going to Europe next summer. I'm so used to traveling with friends because we always went on vacation with Xerx and Zahra. But now with this whole separation thing, I know that our traveling days with the Tegra family are over. Those were some fun trips too. I feel so blessed to have a friend like Xerx. And even Zubin and stuff. People that I've known my whole life. That even know I don't see them too often, when I do, you can tell that there's something there. Like I feel so close to them cause I practically grew up with them and their parents are like my parents. It's a really nice feeling. I'm also blessed for Shenz and the whole family. God, Shenz and Fred really do care about me and Tash like we were their own kids. And just knowing that really means a lot to me. And I hope that mom feels the same way about Zareen cause that would only be fair. So we're talking about fairness in my freshman seminar class and I'm thinking that maybe this class isn't going to be that easy after all. But I love the Professor; we call him Dr. EO. Hahaha, he's really cool. Like I walk into his class and he's like ""do you want a drink?"" Wow, I was like thinking ""what is this?"" Oh, and his classroom is in his office which have weird scary looking statues of people's heads. The office kind of reminds me of the The Vinci Code. I don't know why, maybe the whole ""Louvre"" idea. I always say I hate France and stuff but I really don't. I just think it's kind of funny to say that. But I really don't know why it's funny. But I mean I've said it so many times now that I really think I've instilled the idea into my head. Like I really don't want to travel to France in the summer. But I mean if Caroline wants to, then I really don't care. I think I'm pretty easy going when it comes to life. Like about my grades- I mean if I don't so well in college, what's going to happen to me? I mean, I'm still going to get a job and all, hopefully get into a good grad school. But I mean if for whatever reason I don't, then I think I'll be ok. I mean, it's not like I'm going to die or anything. Plus, if I have my own family then I don't think I'll be able to work and have the kids and stuff. Man, it's a complicated issue. We got a phone in our room, the same one I had in my room at home. But I haven't used it once here. If anything, Jennifer has used it way more than me. Man, I haven't even given anyone the number to this phone cause I don't want them calling in case they call when I'm not here and then have to talk to Jennifer. I'm not sure what I'm more afraid of, them talking to Jennifer or Jennifer talking to them. No, but Jennifer's really cool. But so is Joanna's roommate. Man, I wish I had a roommate like her. Dude, me and Jennifer need to start hanging out more often. But I never want us to have the same friends. John is one of Jennifer's friends. Majoring in Japanese and stuff. Wow, that's cool, especially since he's white and all. I've always wanted to take some random language like Japanese. I don't know, it's like you gain more respect if you fluently learn a language that is so not from where you are. Like me learning a African language and spe ",1
2424,"Today was a long day. I have been going none stop on about four hours of sleep. Chemistry 301, I have found, is really kicking my butt. I made a seventy on the quiz, but I think I could have done a lot better. Tonight I'm going to go see Shrek 2 with Andres and the guys. I can't remember if it is any good or not, but I guess I'm going as an excuse not to do my homework. One day I will get around to reading chapter three in psychology. This weekend I'm taking Bethany to Oklahoma to go see Bradley and Jon for Brad's birthday party. Oklahoma City is such a far drive from here. I think that it will take me about seven hours to get there but then I have to drive another thirty or so minutes to Edmund for the actual party. I'm going to meet Mom Sunday afternoon on the way home for a nice home cooked meal. I haven't had one of those for so long. Well, actually Tim's mother cooked us fajitas and lasagne last weekend when we went to Mexico, but that is not the same as my mom's cooking. After the UNT vs. UT game on Saturday, which might I add we kicked their butt, about eight of us loaded up and decided to go to Mexico spur of the moment. Tim's parents have a house in Laredo. His dad works for A&M International University as an athletic director. Hmmm. I am running out of things to talk about now. October 8th, is the Aubrey homecoming football game and my friend Niki has to crown this year's queen so I'm going home for the weekend to see everyone. I miss everyone a lot but I don't as much as I thought that I would. High school was great but college is so much better. Although, I would have to say that even though I was the valedictorian and I didn't have to study that much in high school, college is so much more difficult. I think I'll probably change my major a few times too. I know for sure that I want to do something in the medical field with children but I have no idea what I want to major in before I get there. And would my phone quit freaking beeping at me so I can finish this assignment!  Ok its just Andres wanting to know if I am going to watch Shrek 2 at Jester tonight at 8. I wish that I could have went to party on the plaza today but I had so much to do it was nearly impossible. I had a TIP mentor meeting at 5, which is when my last class ended but I had to cut that an hour in a half short to go to a TIP seminar that was about notetaking. Now how boring is taking notes about notetaking. That is almost as bad as the seminar I have to go to three times a week. Critical thinking is thinking about thinking. YUCK!  Couldn't the writers of the book think of something just a little more creative than that. I mean who wants to sit in lecture first thing in the morning and listen to a speech about what it means to be a critical thinker. Anyways, then I left the notetaking seminar early to go to Women in Medicine. The speaker there talked about how she had a stroke and was no longer allowed to drive and her vision was now impaired. I couldn't imagine having my driving privledges taking away from me and not being able to see. I have 20/20 vision right now but that doesn't mean that I'm a good driver. I have fallen asleep at the wheel twice in two weeks. Two weeks ago I went to Dallas to go see my friends in a band and I ended up staying in Waxahachie until 8 in the morning. When I was coming home the next day I stopped and got coffee before I headed out but sure enough about thirty minutes later I dozed off. I had to stop at a truck stop and sleep in my car for awhile. I can't believe I keep doing that. It is so dangerous and just last week a girl from my home town died in a car wreck when she was coming home and hit a tree. My Dad called this weekend, which is odd considering he just decided to flee last Christmas and not tell anyone where he was going. He said he had a dream about me and he was just making sure I was ok. I'm not sure if that was an excuse to talk to me or if he really had a dream. The reason why I wonder that is this past year all my dreams have been coming true and it is so weird. If he had a dream about me that was bad will it come true too?  Maybe it is a weird genetic thing and we have dreams that foretell the future. . just kidding. Ok well here is the countdown. I only have about 30 more seconds to type so any second now it is going to stop me. Ok my time should be about up now. Yeah ok I'm done. . The End! ",1
483,I still do not understand why my father after twenty years of marriage to my mother decides out of the blue that he is not happy and to get a divorce. why he feels that he needs to be with that other slut. my mother has been a great wife to him and without her he would probably be nowhere today. he thinks that just because he will give her money that she will be okay without him. but money can't buy happiness. I just hope that my little brother is a okay he is only twelve years old and he gets sad when he thinks about his dad not being there I just do not know how I am going to be ready for my test on Wednesday I have to study way too much for the next two days and I need to get an a in biology I need to do good in all of my classes to raise my GPA I just  hope that my mom does good on her test also because she has been working hard to make the grade my little brother has been working hard in football to get the starting position with his little friends I wish that could just go back to being a little kid when everything was okay with my parents and I did not have to worry about anything but just being a little kid I would not need to worry about anything hopefully he will come back to his senses and come back home ,0
1418,"My day has been a really good day today. I meet up with my ex boyfriend and went out to lunch with him at the Central Market Cafe. Then we began to talk about the idea of seeing other people and we got in a relatively big argument. He accused me of seeing another guy and I told him the truth that I was seeing another guy. We talked to each other and told ourselves that we were going to try and fix and mend the relationship that we once had. It made me feel a lot better about myself because for the past couple of months I have been feeling very depressed and gloomy about myself. I wanted to talk to somebody and when Nick came around and wanted to talk to me for the first time in a long time about the problems that we were having it made me feel a lot better. Nick is my ex boyfriend, just to let you know. The when I got home I started thinking about how far behind I was on all of my school work and I began to stress out about all of the reading and studying that needed to be accomplished in such a short time frame. Then I was thinking about what my Health Promotion teacher told us about relaxing to alleviate stress and other worries that we are having with our lives right now. So I am just now beginning to calm down about my school work and the other stresses in my life right now and trying to pace myself so that I can stay ahead. So I am finally getting to this writing assignment that I had no idea about until last Monday. This just added to the stress that I was feeling about my life but now some of it is off my shoulders because I am doing this assignment. I am worried about my mom right now also because she just went through a divorce and now I am out of her life and not living with her so she really doesn't have anyone to talk to. She always sounds so miserable on the phone when I talk to her and she makes me feel bad for leaving home even when she wanted me to leave. My dad and my mother just recently got a divorce and it has torn all of our lives up but I think that it has torn my mother's life up the most. She had change jobs and start a new life over without my father and his harassing ways to hold her back from wanting the most from her life. She acts so depressed when I hear from her and in turn it makes me feel very depressed about my life too. I love my mother to death but I just wish that she would keep me out of her problems and go seek some help from someone who can actually help her. Anyways I think that school is going to turn out really good and I hope that I can keep up my grades and make it into the Nursing School. I am already into the Pre Nursing School but I have to test into the Nursing School in order to become a Registered Nurse. I am excited about fulfilling my life long dream about becoming a nurse and helping out people who are need of assistance and love. I want to work with children in a pediatric doctors office when I graduate. I really do not want to work in an emergency room with very sick people who come in there almost dead and there is no chance for us to save them. I want to help people out and I don't want to feel like I didn't help them out by letting a person die. ",0
277,"Well, I finally made it to the computer lab. Of course I waited until the last minute. Now that I figured out how to get in here it won't be so hard tomorrow. I hope I can get it done tomorrow by 5 because I only have an hour between classes. I am so happy that I got out of my class early today. It gives me time to study other things. I think I did fairly well on my quiz but who knows. I should have gone to work today. I feel a little guilty for leaving when I did, but I show up and they aren't even there. What am I supposed to do, just stand out in the hall like an idiot?  This job is a waste of my time. They never have anything for me to do anyway. I wish I could quit, but I can't because Mom is friends with Linda and I need the money. Especially now because of the car situation. I swear Don is just being a big baby about the whole thing. I hope I'm not in a bad mood this weekend. It will be nice to just relax without having to go out. I hope my dinner turns out ok. Wally might be sorry he asked me to cook for him. I need to call him tonight for his birthday. I hope the package he got was either from his mom or dad. I can't believe he didn't get a card from either of them last year. I know he was upset about that, but of course he would never admit that to me. It's too bad sometimes that I can't talk to him about everything. Like last night, I know he didn't know what to say when I called, but I just kept thinking that if I had been talking to Rica or Renee they would know how to handle the situation better. But what can I expect, he's just a guy. He's told me before that he doesn't handle the mushy stuff very well. At least he listens to me. I'm glad I had the chance to talk to Genia yesterday. I really do feel bad about not visiting her, but I knew it was best for everyone if we didn't see her. At least she doesn't live here anymore. I think that would be a bad situation. I really hope she gets over him soon. She's been sad too long, and it's just not doing her any good. I've completely run out of things to say, and that doesn't happen to me very often. Unfortunately it's happening more often. I really love it here at UT, but it is incredibly lonely. I see thousands of people everyday, but I'm still lonely. I guess that's why I'm on the phone for so long every night. I need to feel connected to my friends even if I don't see them as much as I used to. Unfortunately, I'm on the phone so much that I don't get much studying done. It's alot different than High school. I never had to study in high school. Now I'm so behind, and I don't know if I'll ever get caught up. I guess when I'm done with this I'll go study until my next class, which happens to be psychology. I thought this was supposed to be a lesson in stress relief. Well, this assignment has given me nothing but a headache. Speaking of headaches I can't seem to get rid of mine. It's either stress or allergies. Either way I'm suffering. Well, I'm finally done so I guess this is it. ",0
2448,"I am watching t. v. and waiting for my friends to get here from out of town. which I don't even know if they are going to show up because they are taking a really long time. I like that movie 50 first dates. I said that because I'm watching t. v. oh I already said that. well any way I am just so bored trying to finish my homework before tommorow just so I won't have a lot to do during the week. I'm waiting for my boyfriend to come home also, but he'll be here on friday. I wish he wasn't in san antonio right now. it always seems like gets down when he visits san antonio. and now he's at the hospital because his cousin stopped breathing. I pray to God that she's. I had one of those pop ups come up because I am on my slow, old computer. I watching the monk. I love the monk because it's mysteries. and the monk always has some cool way to figure out the murders. it's a marathon and I'm starting to get tired of watching it. I hope that venus williams wins in her tennis match today. that will shut some of those people that are saying rude things about her father up. I like both of the sisters but venus hasn't won in a long time so I think it's her turn to take the crown. I am almost half way through this writing assignment. I keep reminding myself that I need to take a look at the experiments so I can sign up for them. I forget how many hours I need. Oh I just looked at the paper, it says 5 hours. I don't know what to write because I haven't been involved in a lot of interesting activities. I wish my friends lived in austin then I wouldn't have to rely so much on seeing derrick. I hope this isn't the same monk, it is so I need to change the channel. I don't know what to watch we got this digital cable but it repeats the channels over and over. Derrick is going to have to give them a call and let them know that. I hope that wasn't intented. man, there is nothing to watch on labor day. I hope I got my class code right because I didn't write it down. that wasn't very smart. now I'm watching the source awards from two years ago on BET. I got to find something a little better to watch. I just changed to what not to wear. I think this show is nice because it makes people over to look so nice. that would be nice in a way if someone did that to me, but then I would be affended that people don't like the way I dress. I have always wanted to be a model, but as they say it takes money to make money. I have this filling that I might win the lottery but I guess everyone has that feeling. I love to talk about what I would do if I won the lottery. I would certainly give my mother a good sum of money and also my step dad. I would give my father enough so that he could retire from the army and not have to work anymore. I would also give my boyfriend a good sum of money because          ",1

1102,"Steam and Consciousness. I am a new coming freshman; I like to be a UT student. To be in a gigantic school like UT, it is exciting but come with some fear. Fear that I might do badly on my school works or could not fit into the environment. After a week past, my point of view began to shift. Now I am comfortable with hundred of students walking on the street and the long waiting line in cafeteria. Sometime, in the back of my mind I could still remember the good times I had with my family. To me, family is the most important thing I can ever have. Through their supports and love now I can understand how important is for me to do well in college and have a descent future. Now, I am in my dorm room thinking about them, and thinking about how much I miss them. When I was little I always wanted to be an adult and take care things on my own. Family at the time never came in my mind, and moreover I sometimes childishly ignore them for video games or other sports. I really regret for what I had missed, a wonderful loving family. Beside to new environment that full with experiences the thing that come to me often is my family back in Taiwan. I wish they could someday see my success and share my proud ness in the field that I love to do or work. ",0
571,"This is the first time I have come to the library and when I first arrived here, I had no idea how to use the computers. First you have to wait in line and get on a waiting list. Then after that you finally get assigned a station to use. I wonder what the point of this assignment is. I think it's just another type of experiment to see what different people are thinking and what affects their thought. How much is someone supposed to write for twenty minutes? People who type fast can take ten minutes and write as much as someone who types slowly and has been writing for twenty minutes. Another feeling I have is that of being worried because I am doing this assignment at the last moment. After finishing it, I hope that I will get to class on time but I should because I still have a couple of hours before class starts. I am not sure what to write now. I have thoughts, but they are personal thoughts so I am not going to write them down. I need to start getting to my morning class on time. I've missed it a couple of times now even though all the material I have learned before but I do still need a review so I have to start trying to get there on time. It's strange typing this assignment because all through high school I always had to worry about grammar, sentence structure, and spelling on writing assignments. It feels like I am writing an e-mail to someone because I never worry about any English stuff on those. The only thing I am doing different is that I am capitalizing some of the words which I normally don't do when I write e-mails. I want this twenty minutes to pass by faster so I can move on to the next assignment. These type of assignments are fun because you can say whatever you want and don't have to worry about anything. I like this class so far. I have always wondered what different people are thinking and what their reactions would be they are in the same situations. Two more minutes and that will be twenty. I can't wait to go back to Houston to visit. I am partially homesick. There are certain things that I want to go back for and other things that I am glad that I left behind. ",0
411,"I got very bored doing my chemistry homework so I decided to do my psy. I am very excited about tomorrow night because my sorority is having a mixer. I am a little confused about what is going on with my ex-boyfriend. I guess since that is what I am thinking about I might as well write about it. I don't understand why boys expect so much from girls when they are starting college. Sometimes it really gets on my nerves how they expect you to come see them in another town every chance you have. They must not understand that we have other things to do. They are not always more important, but they are things that we are obligated to. For example, all I have heard about for the past year before I even came to school here was how bad sororities are. That is the biggest bunch of bull I have ever heard. I am now in a sorority, broken up with my boyfriend and having the best time hanging out with my friends. Now he is telling me that it is great that I am in a sorority, but I just think it is a bunch of crap. He is just telling me what I want to hear. I have done it   plenty of time. Anyways, why worry about that. Well on to a new subject. I love how brain wanders in very different directions all the time. Like tonight, I planned on staying in my room and making the most out of my time. Well since I love my friends so much, when one of them called me and asked me to take him to his truck, I got up and did it. I wasted an hour and a half just out talking to people I did not know. Oh well, I made a couple of new friends. I also hate it when the   phone rings non stop and every call is for me and I have to stop reading to talk to these people who call asking me how I like college. What do they think I'm going to say, that I hate it and want to go back to litttle bitty Bay City. Yea right!  I was excited though when my aunt called and told me to come over any time I want to. And when I got to talk to my best friend in the world it was a lot of fun. Anyways, I don't even have the slightest idea what I am writing about because I can't remember what I have said. I guess I am getting CRS like my mom. I guess it happens when you have more things to organize and think about. I am really glad that my parents made me take typing in high school because I would have a  problem typing all of this if I could not type. I am really pumped up about the football game this weekend. I am so glad that a group of us are going. Well my time is almost over and then I can go up to my room and mark off one assignment from my list that I made. I am really glad that I am an organized person and take on responsibility well. So far organizing time for all of my homework and all of my social activities has gone rather well. I have not had to miss anything and I have kept up with my reading. Well since this is not a grade, I guess since I rambled on it is o. k. My mind is not thinking very complex right now. Just very simple no brained thoughts after a very long day of classes!  ",1
1924,"So here I am sitting at my computer. I am supposed to be doing my homework that I put off all week, I guess you could call this homework though. Its a little cold in here, I haven't taken a shower yet. I hope my roommate doesn't just come home and I'm still sitting here in my pajamas. she goes to san antonio every weekend to see her family and boyfriend. I wish I could go home to see my family and friends. but I don't have the money. I hate my job. I wish it were more like my old job at home. scott was so nice there and here tj just seems like a jerk. maybe I'll get transferred to a closer store. probably not though. I'm hungry and my feet are cold. I wonder why it is that whenever I get hungry I get cold, or maybe its the other way around, whenever I get cold I get hungry. I don't think the second floor dining opens until 4:30, if even that, I can't remember the hours for the weekend. my cell phone is ringing. I really wish my new cell phone would get here. ever since I dropped this one on the way to class it just randomly calls and hangs up and sends me messages, most of them are old by the time I get them, or were sent earlier in the day. I should really take a shower, I feel sticky. I think its from the ice cream. I just finished watching solaris. it was an ok movie, not as good as greg said it was going to be but interesting at least. the whole basis of it was that your basis of reality isn't really what reality is, and who's to determine what reality is anyways. its a pretty far fetched concept. and on a better day I might think about that, but today I've got bigger things to worry about. I like biology, dr pierson is very focused on teaching us to learn, which I think is cool for a professor. they tell you in high school that when you get to college, especially a big college like this one that you are all on your own and if you haven't developed good study skills before you get here you are for sure going to fail. but its just not true. I would have thought people here would be less worried about how we were doing and how we were understanding things, but everyone seems to really care. I wonder how long that will last. that's another thing about living here. in dallas no one really cares. I mean duncanville sure people do, its a smaller town, but if you were to go downtown and ask someone for directions they would probably think you were crazy. here people are much more friendly. just yesterday I was riding the bus home from wal-mart and you know riding the metro's around here you run into all kinds of strange and interesting people, and this older black guy and a group of punk kids gets on the bus. and the kids were so rude to him, and talking to him like he was stupid and making fun of him right to his face and everything. they didn't know him anymore than I did, and sure it was apparent that all of his crayons weren't in the box but it amazed me how disrespectful they were to him. so I said something, and it wasn't even mean, I just started asking them how old they were and how much they thought they knew in the few years they had lived. none of them answered of course, and it really wasn't my place to say, but they shut up. now they got off the bus quickly, but the older guy stayed on and talked to me for awhile. he was nice enough, he had some sort of speech issue. it was like talking to my grandpa after his stroke but much faster. I couldn't tell if he didn't know the words or if his brain couldn't unscramble the words. that's what my grandpa used to say. he didn't talk much after his last stroke, and the doctors couldn't help him if he couldn't tell them what he wanted. and finally one day my mom asked him why he looked angry all the time. and he told her he knew what he wanted to say but when he opened his mouth to say it it came out all scrambled up. so it had to sit and think about it a second time to be sure it came out right. and it wore him down and it made him tired so he just didn't say much. he understood everything we were saying but the delay for him aggravated him so he didn't want to deal with it. its sad ya know. he is very smart, and he is seen so much to tell about, I hope he gets thru this. my mom says he is getting better. I think probably one of the worst diseases must be alztiemers. I know that's not what he is got, but just this small glimpse is scary to me. I couldn't' imagine living thru it. hopefully by the time I get that old they will have figured out a way to fix it. why did I buy two packs of gum?  I went to Wal-Mart yesterday and for whatever reason I bought two packs of gum. I don't' even chew gum that often. maybe I bought one for aida. she is probably going to come home soon, I think she was catching the 3pm bus out of san antonio. I'm going home next weekend. I'm supposed to catch a bus at 4 and get to dallas at 7:45. I guess we'll have to make some stops because I've never gone to dallas or to here and it taken longer than 3 hours. but I probably speed a little. and tj is just going to have to deal with me not being here. I told him two weeks ago not to schedule me on Friday, sat, or sundays because I didn't know when I was going out of town. and what did he do?  schedule me for this Friday. well I already bought the tickets and if I don't go home this weekend I'm going to go crazy. I miss the stupid things, like tricia singing in the shower. that child is so tone deaf its not even funny. or mom knowing all the lyrics to every disney channel song. I miss my chinchilla. his name is mistletoe. I got him for christmas two years ago from my biological father. I don't talk to him anymore. I wonder if he even knows I'm here. samantha knows, I remember telling her last christmas. that's what sux about all this though. I mean its bad that me and russell can't work things out, but that's our issue, but because of it I can't talk to samantha, which isn't fair to her. what did she ever do to deserve this?  it wasn't her choice. and nobody ever asked her. what will she think when she grows up and I haven't been there for her prom and her college years and all that. will she blame me?  I don't know. well I should really go take a shower. my roommate is coming soon. thanks for listening. ",1
1004,"I figured that I would put this assignment off a little more---or at least until my thoughts were more collected, but I now realize that they're am as collected now as they're ever be. I think about all that I have to do, assignments in school mostly, but I am also busy thinking about a certain person all the time. I suppose I'm going through sensory overload right now. my brain is working at a million miles an hour to keep up with the information that is being put in as fast as possible. Then there's that person I mentioned. I am confused about a certain guy that I really like. Sounds so tyipical, right? I will have to put those thoughts aside until school is over for the day. I am pretty unhappy with a lot of people that I have met at U. t. They are so interested in having a good time, all the time. Drinking and sex outside of marriage, namely. I ate lunch with an old friend that I haven't seen in a long time, and all he talked about was partying, and the like. I don't drink, because of the law (I'm 18), and I don't believe that anyone should get drunk because that's what the Bible says. Life seems so messed up. I'm not depressed about it, but I am bothered by what I see in the world. I feel a sense of hopelessnes about me, and I know where it is coming from. It started with the fall of man in the Garden of Eden. God has given man over to his wicked desires, and this means that unless God sends revival, things will continue to get worse. Also, I have been reading about the Clinton administration in a book entitled Unlimited Acess, and I think, ""If this is what our president is getting away with who CAN we trust?!"" Of course, I don't put my faith in things which are seen, but things which are not seen. God is in complete control, and no matter how bad things seem, he will take care of His people. Some day, all of this--including the computer that I'm typing on---will burn up. God will come back to gather His elect and the those who are not will burn in the lake of fire forever. this is such a scary thought, but when you think about it it makes perfect sense. God's gift of salvation was totally voluntary on his part. He doesn't have to save anyone. We all deserve damnation because of our sin. We sinned in Adam. But in God's incredible mercy and love he sent Christ as a propitiaton for our sins that we might not perish but have everlasting life. Oh, that I might be found among those names written in the Lamb's Book of Life! I'm a terrible sinner just like everyone else. I struggle with the same problems that everyone does. But I keep coming back to the cross and pleading the blood of Jesus. I have no inate merit. My righteousness are as filthy rags. It is insane to think that one can somehow work their way into heaven. The Bible says ""Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy He has saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghost. "" Jesus is our only way to the Father. Not our pitiful attempts to earn our salvation. Jesus said, ""I am the Way the Truth and the Life. No man comes to the Father except through Me. "" You have to come to God (it is clearly taught in the Bible), but you can't unless God makes you come(also a clear teaching. ""No man comes to Me except the Father drag him. "") That leaves you in a particularly strange situation. You have to come, but you can't. I pray about that one a lot. Well, those really are the things I think about. I'm a Christian, and I live in constant awareness of my Creator. ",0
1875,"     Today has been totally stressful!! Actually this past week has been stressful! College is very different from highschool. In high school I never even had to study, but I would still make high A's in all my classes! Now. . im not really prepared for all this studying i have to do in college! arg!  Im pretty sure i can handle it, but im still freaking out over only taking 2 tests in each class the whole semester! and those two tests determine my grade. . thats just scary!  Anyways, today in general has been stressful. My mom had to go get an MRI today, and that can't be good. Shes been ok the past few weeks, but something is making her sick! and today also, i found out that my uncles lung cancer is back, we thought it had gone into remission, but no, it came back. This has been really hard for my grandmother because she has to take care of my uncle 24-7. And my grandmother is not in that good health either, but hopefully she can handle all this. And it scares me because my other uncle, also smokes! even though his brother is literally deteriorating before his eyes! but he still won't stop smoking. that really pisses me off! its just so gross and. . blah. Oh well, he has to make that decision on his own, i can't make it for him. Anyways continuing on, one of my roomates is gettin on my nerves. I have 3 roomates in total, and we get along pretty good, but this one roomate, ahh! shes annoying! shes always trying to tell me that im not doing something right! and its always stupid stuff! like, she told me i wasnt cracking the eggs correctly?! or that my grammar on my english paper is wrong, when i know its right! and the thing that makes me mad is i didnt even want her to be my roomate. You see, i got a housing scholarship, for gettin good grades, so i don't have to live on campus. Two of my other roomates got one also. The girl i don't like happened to be a recepient also. She totally butted in and said she wanted to live with me! what could i say?! noo?! of course not! so i said yes. Then during the summer i was hoping she would forget and not transfer her lease over to mine, but what do you know! on moving day, guess whose face i see right as i enter my apartment door, none other than the annoying girl! ahh! this is something that is making my life even more stressful right now too!  Sometimes i wish my parents could just tell me how to live my life, it would just make everything sooo much easier on everyone!  But i guess thats the college life, its just very new to me still. Like, i enjoy not having my parents there telling me to study, or when my curfew is, but i do miss that   parental aspect   that i used to have in my life. College has a bunch of pluses. and minuses. Its not all parties and having fun like some people. Well i guess it is for some people, but personally not all that much for me. (Thats another thing about my roomate. . she is always partying! like 5 days out of the week! thats overdoing it just a tad don't ya think?!?)  But anyways i guess i should write something about the psych class to get some brownie points. lol. I really like that class! its pretty interesting, and the professor is pretty cool and not so boring(like my history teacher who says. . and umm. . alot!!)Im thinking of changing my major to nursing, possibly to become a psychiatric nurse, or possibly a pediatrics nurse. but im not sure(once again. . something i wish the parents could decide for me)  But yea, that class is pretty fun, i just wish it wasnt such a big class! thats another scary thing about college, your just a number! your just a tiny little fishy in a huuuge sea of other fishies!i guess its just cause im straight out of highschool where the classes are only 30 students each. Going from 30, to 500, thats quite a bit of a difference, and it can be rather intimidating for a freshman!  But i guess i will have to learn how to deal with it sooner or later!! hopefully i can survive this year, my goal GPA is atleast a 3. 3 ATLEAST! ahh!! i would like to have higher than that. . but we will just have to wait and see won't we!!

585,"Naturally, since I am a college student, I should be focused on my college education, but my mind seems to be in other places right now. I went home over the summer and ended up meeting a wonderful person. That person and I became very close over the summer and ended up dating for a while. I am a guy and I never thought that I would be able to meet a guy that I could have such strong feelings for. We spent so much time together. I would go to work every morning at 8 am , and I would usually get out at about 6pm. After work, we would go running together. which served two purposes - exercise and spending time together. Well, the summer went by really fast and by the time I knew it, it was time for me to return to Austin. It was really hard to say goodbye to him but eventually I had to do it. On my way up to Austin, I stopped at his house and he had made me breakfast. We ate and talked for a while. I did not want to stay there too long or else I would end up arriving in Austin too late. So I said goodbye. which was one of the hardest things I have had to do in a long while. besides tell my parents that I am gay. I don't think I am the same person after I met him. I have learned how to express my feelings more openly. I used to be so scared to express my feelings to anyone. probably because the people I used to date were girls. and deep down inside I was not happy with them. Now that I have experienced being with someone, and being happy with someone else. I want to feel like that all of the time, but the problem is that he is back home. and keeping a long distance relationship has been really hard. We decided to ""break it off"", and so he has been on my mind lately. which has contributed to my procrastination on this assignment. Anyway, this seems like a dumb thing to talk about. and I honestly can't believe I submitted this for an assignment. but it kind of helped to ""write"" it out. and hopefully I can get this out of my mind and focus on the more important aspects of my life right now. .

2333,"Well, I have to confess, this is an extremely difficult thing for me to do. I am an extremely objective person and it's hard for me focus on something when there is no clear goal in sight, but maybe this will get easier as I go. I hear TV in the next room. My mom is in the kitchen and watching the Republican National Convention. I really should be watching it you because you see I'm a government major (at least that's the plan right now). However, and ironically, the very thing that is going to earn me my government major is also what is keeping me from watching the convention. There now talking about Kerry not being a good leader but the AC which is located next to my room has just come on and now I can't hear. Wow, this is getting a little weird having to make myself consciously voice in writing what I'm thinking. It's amazing you can be so unaware of the thoughts that your own brain  is thinking. Ah, pancakes are ready. I would like to go eat them now but I'm stuck here for another 9 minutes and 43 seconds. OOppss, she used baking soda instead of baking powder. No pancakes I guess. I went to the Phantom of the Opera last semester. It was a Broadway production and vg. I have a pamphlet from the evening sitting on my desk, which is why I bring it up. I was depressing though, for all  the talent and wonderful set changes. Do you like  the sound of the AC. I  do. I don't know why but it comforts me. I think the reason it does is because when I was younger the AC would come and there was a vent right over my bed  so to keep warm I would have to snuggle deeper into my covers and I like to snuggle. That was a run on sentence but that's how I think, in run ons, so I'm just trying to be accurate. I had to look up how to spell sentence. Yes, I know that's horrible, but you see I'm a very phonetically spell, always have been, and so it's very  hard for  me to distinguish between the phonetically pronunciations of vowels. Like in the word sentence, I'm always unsure if it's sentence or sentence. Another example is that I used to spell ""they"" ""they"" because the e sounded like a long a to me. I better fix that if I'm going into government.  ",1
2137,"I am thinking about why exactly I am writing this. I am thinking about how each of my fingers move to touch the keys. Roseanne is on and it is starting to distract me. I really should pay attention to the writing but the sound of the people speaking is distracting me. The show is talking about feminism, which brings up an interesting point. I really don't like women who are amazingly feministic. I just forgot what my next thought was. Oh well, I feel kinda of hungry. Maybe I should get something to eat. But instead I have this laptop sitting on me while I try to type my steam of consciousness. Speaking of stream of consciousness, which I spelled wrong above. The stream of consciousness is something that I read in the textbook. Some doctor of psychology came up with this idea that monitoring the stream of consciousness will lead to people understanding more about themselves. Roseanne just made a joke and it is funny. But as I was thinking or writing which ever one your prerogative chooses. Before I digress, or maybe I will or maybe I won't. Now that I choose to reflect on my day I realize that I didn't get that much accomplished, but there is still a lot of the day left. I am really not sure where I am going from here. There was just a commercial about the aggie came against utah. boy I sure do love hi I just answered my phone and it is Kristi my friend she is also in psychology. we are talking about this assignment. she is walking back from the dobie center. I am supposed to meet her and her friend Richard. I am going to play Richard in football on the video game. Boy I really like football. Like I was saying I love football and I can't wait till the game against Arkansas. Boy that is sure going to be a good game. I just happened to notice that I only have six minutes left to write. I really like this assignment it is really fun. My hands are getting tired of typing and I just thought back to when professor said that someone put in instructions to a vcr that is definitely funny. I really don't like Roseanne but somehow she is getting my attention. I am really trying to concentrate on what I am thinking but I believe that is the reason it is hard for me to write more, because I am thinking so hard. My computer fan just turned on and that means it is starting to get hot. But in here it is actually cool. Speaking of my dorm room, I really like it. Well my 20 minutes is up but I am just going to finish writing this last line right here. ",0
2460,"     I wasn't expecting to get sick, but for some strange reason, I am sneezing,  coughing, and everything, it is crazy. I am surprising myself lately though. I  thought I would be much more home sick, but I don't know what I am missing, or if I  am missing anything at all. I know I miss work, nothing made me more happy  really. I know it wasn't fun all the time, but the people there made it worthwhile. One in particular, no two in particular both for different reasons. I wonder when life is going to get easy. I have been working hard since I was 16,  balancing a job, school, and trying to have a life. Trying is the key word. Sometimes I think I missed out in high school. I was never the party type, only  because my parents wouldn't let me do anything, but I understand that they just  want the  best for me and don't want me to make the same mistakes that they  made. What they don't understand is that, it is holding me back, because  eventually I may be in the same situation that they were in, and I won't know what  to do. If I were to live anywhere in the world I would live in England, Surrey was  nice. London is amazing. I don't know what to say other than when I was there I  felt home, I loved it. I surprisingly enjoyed having the ability to commute rather  than drive. I enjoy taking drives though. When I was at home, I enjoyed just  grabbing my keys and going. I never had a particular destination, but my favorite  drives were at night, with the sun roof open, oh how it was so peaceful. Kind of  like sailing. Recently I joined the saililng club, it is nice, I wish there was more  wind my first sail, but even so it was still unbelievably calm, and placid. It was so  nice, and made time go by so fast. I feel so stupid about Endochine, I can't believe  we were just talking to them and didn't know it was then, awwww. I feel so  stupid. But then again there are a lot of times I feel stupid. too many to list. I can  not wait to go to the football game. I miss band the most from high school, there  was nothing like marching into the stadium, especially this past year when the  crowd was actually happy that we were there. I honestly never thought I would  see the day that that would happen. Christina Aguilera's CD is very good, at least  most of it. it is kind of sad at the same time. It is surprising how cold it was this  morning, here I am dressed as if it were 98 degrees outside and it feels more like  70 unbelievable this is supposed to be Texas. I am so glad my Aunt and her  partner are here , even if Lester isn't exactly the most honest or faithful person, it is  still nice to see Linda. I love accents, I wish I had an english accent. for some  reason I especially like the way after they say something they follow it up with  mate or love. Another reason I want to move to London, I love the way they talk. I  also love Orlando Bloom who also lives in England, he is gorgeous. But  sometimes I wonder if he, in real life is stuck up or real down to earth. That irritates  me when you see celebrities that think they can have anything they want, and the  way people gravel at their feet. They are no different from the average joe other  than they can pretend to be someone they are not and get paid for it. pretty sweet  deal actually, I wish someone would pay me to be someone else so I could live a  fairy tale. Sometimes I wish life were like a movie, not like the Faculty though. more like Kate and Leopold. Mostly love stories, that would be amazing. Though  at the same time it might be too predictable. One can wish though right. I wonder  what I am going to be when I grow up, I mean really grow up. I really have no  likes or dislikes, which sometimes makes me wonder, if I have a personalitly, or if I  am just here. How is it possible for people to exist anyways. I don't know if I buy  the whole evolution thing or the Bible. If the Bible is true then were did the  dinosaurs come from. And if  vice versa then how did the Bible come about. I still  believe there is a God because I think it is important to have something to believe  in. But sometimes I think what if God wasn't real. There would be many times I  would be lost in my life in that case. For some reason. I think there is some sort of  force that looks out for people,  ",0
2051,"writing for twenty minutes seems like an incredibly long time, but I have always heard that keeping a journal is good for your mental health. So, maybe this experience is kind of keeping a journal. I'm listening to music right now while I do this and it is actually kind of distracting me. Its for my History of Rock Music Class which is actually kind of boring, but I heard its going to get better. As I write this I notice how incredibly bad at typing I am. Other people are probably going to have a novel by the end of 20 minutes. I am going to have like a couple of paragraphs. That is really sad. Now, I am thinking all psychological though. I am like oooooh, they are going to read this and think that I compare myself to other people. "" I do compare myself to people all the time. I am very competitive. My arms hurt already. I do badly on computers. I hate staring at the screen. When teachers make you read articles off of the computer, I always have to print it out-which is kind of annoying. I also notice how incredibly bad my sentence structure is when I am not thinking about making it good. I am kind of surprised I made an A in rhetoric. I loved rhetoric. It was really interesting for me. All my classes this semester seem interesting. Tough-but interesting. Geology is weird. Hopefully it will get better. I found out today that I could have been in a psychology class about love and relationships before taking Psychology 301. I am really interested in that kinda of psychology specifically. So I am sad, but psychology 301 will at least be a good introduction. And now I sound like a suck-up because this is for psych 301. And now I sound like I care about what people think. I do though to some extent. ooooooh fun song on. That Swing Swing Song by All-American Rejects. I like it a lot. It reminds me of the summer. I wish I would've seen American Pie Three. I didn't even see the first or second one though-haha. My room is so quiet and alone and big when my roommate is not here. She is strange and different, but she is really unique and I like her a lot. She is never here though. Her boyfriend goes to A&M-just like my boyfriend. She always goes to their games and never has even been to a UT game! I told her she should come to the Arkansas game with me and she was like ""OH YEAH! WE played them last week!"" WE. WE. she said ""WE"" as though she was from A&M. she is crazy. My boyfriend lives in College Station and you will never find me there. There is nothing to do. So, he comes to Austin. I realize I have pictures of people in my room that I do not even like. I only have a picture of this girl Jenny because she is really good friends with my boyfriend. She and I are cordial to each other in person. We hate each other really though. I know she hates me a lot-my boyfriend told me. I hate that she hates me because I am usually nice to her. But , I hate her too. But she is obnoxious to me and kind of bitchy. So, I think I have the right to not like her. Wow, twenty minutes is a long long time. I still have 8 minutes left and I feel like I need to do something else. Maybe that means I have ADD. I cannot read for more than like 20 minutes at a time. Its really hard to be like that in college cause everything is reading. I am behind in all of my classes. I study and read-I just have to take breaks and re-read a lot cause I don't catch everything. Like I try to keep up, but I can't. Its bad. I need to study more but then I stress myself out if I don't do anything but study. I need to be in organizations because they help take my mind off of school for a short time period. I stress myself when I study 24/7. That is how it was over the summer. Everyone else went to Frat parties every night and I stayed in and studied. There were NO organizations to be in. There were only frat parties. And I don't even like frat parties all the time. Drunk people can be fun sometimes--but like a million guys and just a couple girls can be obnoxious. 8 drunk guys hitting on you all once is a little overwhelming. And plus boyfriends do not generally like that. So, I stayed in and studied. I was so focused on my grades that I would stress out about getting anything worse than an 85. Because I was not completely done with a rough draft of paper once, I stressed out so much that I threw up. it was really bad. All of my friends were REALLY worried about me. I passed out and everything. Over a paper! yeah, that is pretty scary. I guess I am just not good with my time management. I don't know. Something is really messed up with me I think. My boyfriend thinks I could use a counselor. But if I see a counselor I probably will not have time for activities besides school. And that would not give me anytime to not think about school-which is what activities do for me. I like that I am doing them. I hope I make Lassos. I am worried that that will take too much time and stress me out even more. We shall see. ",0

1146,"I am thinking about the fact that since I have gone to college I have absolutely no free time. I am so extremely tired, and I know that I can't go to sleep because I have so much homework to do. It is 12:40 in the morning and I just got home, from things that I had to do today. I am scared that everyone is mad that they never get to see me. My girlfriend probably thinks that I am trying to avoid her, but really I have no free time at all. The whole fraternity thing is fun, but I never have any time to do anything. I have met so many awesome people, and I am excited that I have only been here for 3 weeks and I have met people that I will be friends with for the rest of my life. My school work is also quite time consuming. What I do know is that I hope that I make my grades this semester. Tonight was a rough night, I think that I have done more work than I ever have in my whole life. My dorm room seems secondary to other places that I have to be during the day. The only time I am ever here, is when I am sleeping. My life has changed drastically, but I know it will all turn out great. I am sad for some of my friends from high school. Most of my best friends came to school down here, and the ones who did not seem scared. I still talk to my best friend, who I dated last year. Her birthday is this weekend, and she is not even going to spend it with her best friends. If I could be there for her I would, but I am extremely busy this weekend. I bought tickets to the Dave Matthews concert in Dallas this weekend, but I am not going to be able to go. My whole plan was to surprise my best friend with tickets, and myself in Dallas but of course it fell through. There are so many things that I want to do, but I feel swamped. I wonder what it is like for my parents, they are empty nesters this year for the first time in 30 years. 30 years they have had a child in the house, and suddenly nobody. I did not receive a good wrist band for the Texas OU draw, and I couldn't get tickets to the game. That makes me mad that I sat in line for three hours to get tickets, but I received none. Well I guess that is just another one of life's great blunders, standing in line. ",1
855,"Well right now I only have a couple things on my mind that don't seem to leave my head all day long. The two big ones are this guy I saw again and had a great time with and my school work. These two things are really bugging me. First off with school I am worried about what type of grades I am going to get,whether or not I am going to keep myself on top of my works, whether or not I will have the will power to actually tell people no I can't do this because I have to study, how are the first test in all my classes going to go, is there going to be an overwhelming amount of information on my exams that I am going to have to knwo, how much harder are these tests going to be then my test I had in high school, how exactly do I study for a college test when there is so much information to know, how specific are the questions going to be on the test and are they going to be tricky questions. These are a lot of the questions that run through my head and I am not usually a person who freaks out about stuff in my life. I guess another reason I am so worried is because I would really like to get into the business school if possible, but everyone tells me how hard it is and that I am going to have to make a 4. 0 and then even then I possible could not get in if I don't have the right connections or know the right people. So on that note, I am starting to try to figure out exactly what am I going to do with my life or major in if I don't get into the business school. I guess there are other things that I am interested in, but it would just make life a lot easier if I got in. The other major thing on my mind is this guy a saw again and hung out with the whole weekend. He is such an extremely nice guy, smart, gorgeous, and so much fun to be around and totally sweet. I haven't been treated like he treated me in a long time. He seemed totally into me too, but I don't know. I guess the whole self-conscious thing is coming into effect of whether he felt as strongly about me as I did about him. He seemed like it though. He also just happens to go to Texas A&M too. Which makes things even more confusing. One, if we were to become boyfriend and girlfriend would things really actually work out doing the whole long distance relationship thing?(It's only an hour and 45 minutes away, but still that's different than living in the same town 5 minutes away) Also what goes on in my head is would I really want a boyfriend right now just starting off college and would I really want to put up with whole long distance thing. I can't stop thinking about him and I think he would be worth doing it for if that was what he wanted too. He is actually 3 years older than me, so I know and recognized he already went through the whole party and chasing all the girls phase that a lot of people go through when they first start college. I don't even know how this guy exactly feels about me so in ways I am crazy thinking all this stuff so quickly and soon in my head. I just could tell how much he cared by his actions and things he said that he must be feeling the same way that I do, but who knows I guess time can only tell how the future of my grades and how this guy and I are going to work out, so I should probably stop stressing and worrying about it so much. I guess I can only prepare myself the best I can for all my classes and whatever happens with the guy I guess is ment to be. ",0
447,"I don't know what to expect. By best friend's father passed away Monday and I am really worried about the family. His mother does not work and he is in college without much financial aid. I hope he will be able to continue school, but I don't know what's going to happen. I am scared to face them, though. I can't see the family being whole without the father. They were always so close to one another and could share anything with each other. I envied that relationship because my family was broken up at an early age. When my father and mother divorced, I was only about two or three. I actually don't even know when they divorced. I really can't even picture my parents being together at all. They are so different now. I guess that is why I was envious of my friend's family. I never have had a very close relationship with any members of my family. I feel alone inside my parents house. When I went to my friend's house, though, they were always so open with each other and there was never any tension or anxiety between them. I don't see how a family like that could be torn apart, or actually why. Some people think there's a reason for everything, and some people believe that it's all a part of God's plan, but I, personally, have no idea what reason or higher purpose there could be for this man's death. Maybe there isn't any reason. Maybe humans have a natural tendency to search for reasons, causes, purpose. Are we all just misleading ourselves?  Could it be that humans are merely just another species on the face of this planet?  Who knows. James' father knows. He has all the answers to all the questions in life. It's funny that the questions of life are only found in death. He is dead, nevertheless, and I still can't come to that realization. Traumatic experiences just never happen to me or people I know. Until now, I guess. What the hell happened?  Five minutes to go. I remember just before I left, coming back to Austin for my second year, shaking his hand, and hearing him wish me luck. How can that man be dead?  Then I remember that death is a part of living; death is the price tag of life. We all have to face it sometime, and I guess it's not going to happen at our convenience. We have to prepare ourselves for anything, but how?  I don't know of any way I could have prepared for this. If I would have known that he was going to die, I would have tried to stop it from happening. I would have wanted him to keep on living. Why is that?  If death is so common, why do humans try so hard to prevent it, rather prolong it from happening?  I can't say that it's selfishness, I wouldn't want him to live just so I could live happy. But that is a part of it. But, the answer awaits me as well. I guess I'll have to prepare myself for my death. That means I better start living my life. ",0
1061,"Well, I don't know where to begin. I guess it started when she came over for lunch. I never would have know what great thing was going to happen that strange windy day. She swooped in and plopped herself on my new Pappason chair. She was so gracious to bring me a freshly baked apple pie. As she poured all of her energy into describing a new dress she had found in the Hit or Miss store I noticed it. How her eyes had a strange twinkle about them. I mean, don't get me wrong Randy is the best friend I have ever had, and her eyes always shone, but for some reason today, they almost glowed. As she began to finish her story a serene silence filled my small living room. It was barely noticeable that my over grown Lab  Dixie had trampled into the room wearing half of the back yard. Then the words just fell out of her mouth. ""He's come to rescue me, and I'm going to go. "" I have never felt such a mixture of relief, happiness, utter joy and somehow an utter ripping in my soul. I was loosing the best thing that had ever happened to me. My best friend was on her way to her life long dream. All I could do was cry and hug her. Then she started crying and we were just an absolute mess. There was no other sensible thing to do besides get that apple pie and slap some vanilla ice cream on it and CELEBRATE! Wow. She's gone. What is left of me? I sat around my quaint little home, breathed the clear air and wept all my emptiness out. I mourned the loss of my closest and dearest friend for. I don't know how long. It seems like a whole season passed. Then one day, I got tired of crying. I knew that deep inside there was something in me that drew that wonderful friendship and I'd be darned if I was going to let it rot inside of me. So, I did what any normal person would do to seek selffulfillment. I joined a club. I went to every dang meeting any time those doors were open. But you know what, I didn't find it. So, I began to search books in the library on sewing, butterflies, architecture toadstools, anything and everything that seemed of some minute interest to me. I left the library with so many books, my arms almost fell off. But, no that was not my answer. sigh you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to meet myself a man. I will find out what love is all about, and I mean real love. So, take that! Thus, my Man Hunt began. I browsed the Video Dating services, the internet (big mistake, HUGE), I scoped men at the grocery store, I bought some roller blades and tried out Hike and Bike trails, but nope, nothing'. Oh, I met men all right, but the kind of guys I met made me want to swear off of them forever. Yet, something was in me that just kept popping up over and over and over again. He's out there, my Prince is going to come rescue me, I just have to have faith in real love. After some serious time had passed, I stepped out of my life and looked at what I had, and noticed that my Many Hunt had taken over every part of me, and nothing that was left was desirable, even to me. So I just plum gave up. I was not going to let this hole in my heart rule my life. And that was it. So, I dropped all of my memberships and subscriptions and just began to spend time alone, and then I began to pray. It helps so many other people, why not me? you know what happened when I shut myself alone in my room with nothing but some soft music and candle light? My heart was completely and totally overflowed with peace. How in the world can the words I choose let you know about my sweet experiences with the Lord? He is the absolute perfect gentleman. I began to talk with Him every day. I began to listen for His voice and I began to find Him everywhere I went. I realized, I was never alone. I was being filled with love that brought me over and through every little thing that would try to bring me down. The lord God in Heaven loves me, and I love Him. And you know what else, after I gave my heart to Jesus, I met Mark. Would you believe that he was walking by my house with his 2 Great Danes and was stopped to tie his shoe as Dixie bolted out my front door. We met, just that simply. He has arrived at my front door now, so I better go. We are on our way to Jamaica oh how I love to be rescued! ",0
1944,"Well, I am wondering if I had read the instructions as carefully as I could have. The timer at the stop was unexpected. Convenient though. Although, I had planned to just look at my roommate's clock radio. It is reading 10:02. I am working on my day planner trying to figure out where my free time is going. College is different from what I expected it to be. I'm not sure what is worse knowing no one or knowing 7 people out of 10,000 undergraduates and wondering if I will see someone I know today. It could be worse. I need to try to call my aunt today. I tried yesterday, but she was not there and I really didn't want to leave a message. I really don't know my family in Austin as well as I should. I wish I could go up to Ohio and see how cousins are doing up there. I have no idea where my roommate is. This is the 3 day he has not returned from wherever he goes. It is funny when I think about it. I wake up try not to make any noise then I realize I am the only one in the room. It is exciting as it is lonely. Maybe I'll do laundry today or something. I can't believe I actually like going to my classes. Perhaps it is because I do not have anywhere else to go. Human contact is everywhere, but I just want to feel welcomed outside of a classroom atmosphere. Matchbox Twenty's Unwell just finished playing on the radio. The Oh Baby song just came on. I am amazed at what passes for music sometimes. Hip hop is not music. Rap is a joke. They don't even make sense, they just try to rhyme their words with the next line. I liked Will Smith as a rapper, but I don't think he does it anymore. Clean rap is a thing of the past. Once it stood for something now it has shifted to image and jewelry. Sad. I am feeling a little tired. I have been sleeping very well, but sometimes I forget where I am. A moment of panic surrounds me then I realize where I am. 4 walls, 4 plain walls can be intimidating to wake up to everyday. I can't wait until we get those message boards up. Maybe we can add some character to this room. I am getting thirsty know. This dormitory is secluded, but it is alright unless I need to get something to eat or drink. I am not going to use all my Bevo Bucks on vending machines. From what I heard, they go fast while dine in dollars linger on and on. At least I am not in Jester. Almost done. Now what should I write about? ",0
222,"The computers at Contessa Dorms have no modems. I learned that the hard way. So far, here at UT, computers have been quite a pain in the ass. My password for UT access won't work. Maybe because its nine letters. I can't tell; the instruction sheet said that you're password should be up to 8 letters, not that it had to be at least eight letters. Here in Austin should means has to, I guess. Sir Mix-A-Lot is gone, I guess. He did that Baby Got Back song, and then he disappeared, unless youÃ¯Â¿Â½re a hardcore rap fan. I once read about some little down in the Midwest where a bunch of rappers lived and made music. Like Robert Earl Keen lives in Bandera, Texas, where I went to summer camp one year. We called ourselves the Homies, and had an old cowboy hat called the Homie Hat. Some guy in another tee-pee shot it up at Riflery one day, so we had a funeral service, of which I was the preacher. We made am H out of rocks above the hole where we placed the hat and said a prayer. The counselor said it was sacrilegious, but we went through with it anyway, and later dug it up and moved it because we thought some one was going to grave-dig it. ThatÃ¯Â¿Â½s a great piece of trivia in my life- Where ids the HOmie Hat buried?  Someday, maybe I'll go visit Robert Earl Keen and we'll go up to Hamman Ranch YMCA camp along the banks of the ice-cold Medina River and find that H. That would be cool. When I was younger we went to the Monahns in West Texas, whenever we were visiting my grand-parents in Midland. Now my mom and grandmother are in a big tiff over a pins shower cap in the upstairs shower. Its a silly fight, of course, but I guess its kind of interesting to see who gives in and talks to the other first. My favorite tiff ever was the Tongs-Becky tiff of late 1995. It involved car accidents, lies, rumors, name-callings. Now Tongs goes to Montana State, in the Big Sky conference, which brings me back to tiffs. I knew this girl at St. Ed's named Jenn who had a friend she hadn't seen in a long time who went to Southern Utah, which I think is in the Big Sky. So I told her that next time she emails her she should mention that she knew someone in Austin who had a friend who was going to another Big Sky school. I don't think she ever intended to do it, but she emailed her anyway, and this Southern Utah girl never wrote back. I guess she'll never know about the whole Big Sky? Texas coincidence, unless Jenn told her, which I rather improbable. She obviously didn't care. Jorge stole Todd Snider's straw cowboy hat, which is now sitting right in front of me as I write. Todd SNider, from Nashville, was playing at the Luckenbach Laborfest, where we saw him a year before and when he crowd-surfed, Jorge just yanked it off his head. It was badass. Jorge says he doesn't feel bad about it. I wonder if Todd misses that old hat. I think he does, but he learned a valuable lesson, like when Jerry Jeff lost his guitar, and found it at some bar in New Mexico a year later. That story is probably bullshit, as most of Jerry Jeff's seem to be. It doesn't matter- I don't pay to hear storied from an era in his life that he probably really doesn't remember, but I do wish he's play a bigger variety of songs- the man has released over 30 albums- all different, yet plays the same set at every concert. I've never even heard Pot Can't Call the Kettle Black, and thatÃ¯Â¿Â½s one of his biggest songs anyway,. You want stories, talk to old Sean- his stories pretty much suck, but his pride in telling them is what is so interesting. He makes a walk from Georgetown to the Jefferson Memorial sound fascinating, while I almost get lost lost-to-death in some God-forsaken part of East Texas, and I can't even keep people listening. ",0
1673,"     My room is so dark and cold right now. I wish my roommate didn't like to sleep as much so that I can have lights on and have the blinds open. I call my room oppressive sometimes. But I like my roommate so I am willing to compromise for her. So far, she has proven herself to be a good person and above all, a good friend. Today, when I needed someone, she was there for me. Well, today I found out there was more to a story that my boyfriend told me. I was so hurt and tearful and angry. And I felt alone. He is one of my closest friends but I can't go to him now. And so I went to her. She was there and comforted me and gave me food, which is always a sign of good friendship. She gave me advice and stuff. But I am debating whether or not I am going to take it. See, I love my boyfriend so much. I can't see myself living without him. I don't know what to do. I feel likke he has deceived me and I honestly can't trust him anymore. Trust was the thibng that I sough in him. It was the thing that I could not find anywehre else. No one but him made trust available to me. And now that feelign is gone. I really do love him though, and I am hoping that love will get me through this, but it can only go so far. I have to think of my own feelings. I have to think of what is good for me too. I shouldn't be in a relationship where trust isn't there. I shouldn't put myself in a position where I will be hurt again and again. But on one note, this is the worst thing he has ever done. He loves me so much and cares for me so much. He wouldn't hurt me for no reason. But he didn't have a reason. well in a way he did. He didn't want to tell me the truth of the situation cause he knew I would get upset and be hurt, which is the way I am now. I just wished he had told me the truth and been honest with me. I always enjoyed how we were so open and honest with each other. Now, I feel like it can't be like that. I feel it will be like that not cause we want it to be but because he knows I don't trust him and therefore he has to be honest with me so I can trust him again. Depsite all of myfeelings for him, I don't know what to do. I don't know whether I shoudl forgive him completely, give him a third chance, or just dump him. I love him to much to let him go completely so there goes option nubmer 3 but I cannot forget what he did. It will always be on my mind. I will always recall the time he deceived me. I don't like feeling deceived. It makes me feel used and disgusted with myself. I honestly feel like curling up in bed with the lights off. But then I would be doing as my roommate does. I wonder what he is thinking now. I wonder if he is really sorry for what he did. I wonder if he cares about me as much as he says he does. I can't fathom what is going on through his head. He is always thinking about stuff. He denies it but you can tell. YOu can alawys tell with soemone like that. I really do love him. I really really do. And my heart tears every time he does bad stuff to me. But this is his first time to do anything this bad. Usually he makes small mistakes like neglecting to do something. This is big. He hid something important from me. Well. . yeah he did lie to me before. And I forgave him cause it was not really that important of a lie. It was jsut the fact that he lied to me that hurt. It breaks my trust and ruins all of the faith that I have in him. I have faith in such few things. Like, I love all of my high school friends, but I know that they weren't the best to me at times. THey would leave me out and ignore me at times. My boyfriend has always proven not to be like that. He is there for me when I need him. Maybe we should be friends instead of boyfriend/girlfriend. But we tried that in the beginning and eight months later we are in love. It is probably inevitable that if we do become friends again, we would fall in love again. Our personalities are like that. We are really good together like that. Everyone says so and I feel it. I feel a connection to him that I have never felt with anyone else. It is the strongest bond that I could ever have or ever will have. I can't tell anyone how much he means to me. If they do ask, I tell them that he means the world to me. Oh God, I think I've turned to one of those codependent girls that I've always hated. Ugh, I hope not. I hate to be like. Hopfeully i am not. ",1
2195,"I am so hungry. I Can't wait until lunch in 40 minutes. I'm going with my twin sister and our new friend Kristin. she is my sorority sister. I love being in a sorority. I'm kinda nervous though, I hope I make a lot of friends. I hate this song that is playing, its so annoying. I really want to change the station. I can't wait, I want some pretzel and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. and some fruit, definitely a banana. I'm worried that the peanut butter is going to make me fat. I'm not used to the food here, even thought I don't really look fat, I feel a little fatter, but I'm not eating bad junk food, just normal food, but its not like the food from home. plus I'm not getting as much exercise here, its just so hard to fit everything in, and I'm not in a schedule yet, I hate that. but I really want to be more easy going. school I scaring me right now, I'm worried because we have not had any tests yet so I don't really know what any of them are going to be like, so I don't know how I will do, and I'm not at all used to doing bad, I always get high a's and I don't know if that will happen here. I hope a good song comes on now that one finally ended! so anyways I'm really really freaked out because my hair is falling out. like I sit here and . wait I love this song! I want to turn it up. anyways I think its because of all the stress I'm under. this happened to me earlier this summer and then I winced I finally relaxed it stopped, but its like a chain reaction because I get stressed and worried so my hair falls out and then once I see my hair falling out I get even more stressed and worried because it always looks so bad in a pony tail and when its down it just never looks good any more and it makes me feel ugly so that stress me out more and I continue to worry and it just does not stop. last week was really hard but this week I think I'm more used to everything so hopefully I will stop stressing so much because its not really doing me any good, I just want to have so much fun at college and I totally am. I really like all the friends I have made so far. I have a really fun group of girls in my dorm we call ourselves kin's klan lol. we all live at kinsolving, I m so happy that we are friends and that we have so much fun together. I can't wait to start making some good guy friends. it sucks because they are always so drunk whenever I meet them so they never remember my name even though we've met like 20 times but that happens to everyone. I'm not really hungry anymore but I just want to go to lunch and see my friends. o crap I have to go to stupid calculus after that and I really don't want to go and watch my t/a get chalk dust all over himself he is such a mess and I can't understand him at all I hope I am able to figure out the last five problems today so that I don't have to do it anymore and I can just submit the answers and get one thing done. o yah I have to ask eklly about chemistry I hope she remembers how to convert celcius to ferenhright and how to calculate water displacement because I definitely don't remember. ooo my fingers are tired. but I like typing lol. I'm really enjoying reading all this psychology stuff its fun but at the same time I'm totally self diagnosing myself. I'm like oo my neurotransmitters are so messed up and I need drugs for these and I need drugs for these I think its kinda funny at the same time. I can't wait until our mixer tomorrow night with sae it is going to be awesome. and then the match on friedya I really want to dress up whitetrash but that will be weird wehn we go to ato which we willdef do because I'm a totally ato groupie and I'm still dressed in my white trash outfit. the music is out how annoying it must not have good reception. I never listen to music here anymore and I barely watch tv I kinda like that there is just too much other stuff to do and if there is time to relax then there is time to do homework which I always haved or time to hang out wiht kins klan or time to sleep. I really need more sleep I just took a 20minute nap in between my two last classes it was great I love feeling so refreshed I felt like I slept for hours. why can't I feel that good in the morning? ewww that morning that makes me think of the disgusting yogurt they had in the cafeteria, first it was not mixed. like I could see gross water in it so I mixed it and then it was plain,. who serves plain yogurt. op I'm hungry again. and know I have to go to the bathroom. I hope I get used to community bath soon because its so weird like just uncomfortable I don't want to listen to other girls going to the restroom lol. o well I'm sure ill get over it its only the 3rd week but it feels like I have been here forever I love it so much freedom and I can do anything I want it will be so weird going home next summer. next summer we already have to be renting apartments for next year its way to early I have only lived here for 3 weeks I hope I get good roommates and live in a fun complex like either the new new villas or the new boardwalk that would be crazy fun,, maybe a little too much fun lol I hope I'd be able to get my work done o well I can't wait to have so much fun. I really think I would be nice to meet a cute /nice guy here. ugh I'm tired of typing but enjoying this stream of consciousness thing its a good way to think umm I need to call my mom and tell her she owes me some money! yah but not really I had to go pay for a text book myself so I need to get paid back for that I feel like all I do here is spend money I just want everything I see thank goodness for bevo bucks and dine in dollars speaking of bevo I also most got a tattoo of a longhorn on my butt last week but now that I have had time to think about it I'm not so sure but I think It would be totally awesome if I did it   ",1
1580,"     Well here i sit at college and Its kind of weird. IN the next room there is music playing which I like. It makes me excited to go to a concert. , i remember the last concer that I went to. It was in good ole Tennesee, and I was Occumpanied by my cousin. Now she is quite a character and at the time she was attending Memphis University. She now lives in Hawaii, what a tough life. My room is surprisingly clean today, which is surprising. I always imagined that college would be a messy room with clutter everywhere. Actually it is quite organized. I have never considered myself an oraganized person, but as I have grown older I have realized that indeed I do enjoy some sense of organization. My roomate is telling a prettye funny story in the next room, and it leads me to thinking of all of the stories that I have. Coming from Midland, it was quite enjoyable to hear that my teacher was indeed from Midland. A friend away from home you could say. My connection in the bussiness. . haha, I didnt always live there though, I came from the next town and it was quite a change moving there too. Im not sure how it all compares to moving to college, but I do remember that it was right before I entered High school and it was still a major adjustment. I went home this weekend and watched my old football team play. My high school that is. Now we have had a winning tradition over the past few years that included a state championship and playoff trips every year. That is beside the point now, because i witnessed a beating worse than I could have imagined on that friday night. Nothing could go right. I miss football now that its gone, but i also know that the players here are very big and strong and would rip me in half. You never know though, with alittle hard work, next year i coujld step on the field in burnt orange. I have not written much lately, and I know that I should have been writing every day. I once read that writing everyday is the only way to improve your craft. That and reading, but I know that I will have no shortage of reading this year. I have already had tons of reading, but its not that bad. I enjoy reading. I guess this kind of writing is a form of rambling. When your thoughts kind of slow down, its hard to keep writing. You think that you should be thinking of something meaningful. Somthing that would inspire whoever reads this. Inspire or say something meaningful. Its hard to stand out in a place as big as this. With so many numbers you have to be somewhat unique. You can't be too unique or people will dismiss you as trying too hard, but at the same time you can't be ordinary. You have to find the median. The happy place you could say. Not only happy for you, but the place that gets you happy with others. You can't just sit back anymore and wait for somthing to happen. You have to make it happen. As clich'e as it sounds, its true. In the words of Mick Jagger and the Stones,   You can't always get what you want. .   You could say that they truly are wise old men. You can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes, then you might find, you get what you need. Amen brother. Spoken by a true poet. I have always liked comedy in my writing. Not that everything is always funny, but it adds a sense of connection to the reader. I mean if someone laughs as they read, the work actually does something for them. If they simply sit and read words on a page, then it means nothing. It was a wasted tree. Often times the reader would rather look at a tree than read what is on the page. I by no means claim to be a great writer nor do I claim to make people laugh, I am simply claiming that I like to laugh as I read. I enjoy to read a sentence that makes me laugh out loud. If it makes you stand up and dance, well there you go brother welcome to the world of reading. It is a shame that I do not write as much as I used to. The Ideas are there, I just have not gotten them out yet. They will be there, it will just take time. I guess that is a premature assumption that the ideas will be there. My memory is not the greatest right now, at 19 years old. When I hit seventy or beyond, I can't wait until I have to write my name on my hand just to remember it. . ",1
1509,"     my name is david i am 19 years old and i love to work out and talk to girls i don't know why i love girls so much i like girls who are tanned athletic and have nice breasts.

I really don't know what would happen like would she really kiss me back, shes got a good heart i don't know if she would feel comfortable kissing a cheating boyfriend. I've never cheated even though it would be easy for me somehow my girlfriend would find out i know it. i really want to play video games right now. if video games and girls didnt exist i probably would already be a doctor. I am extremely smart well not extremely but i am capable of handling anything i think. i get pissed off so easily if people call me dumb which im not. i don't dress up at all here and i still look good i wish i didnt have acne i swear if i was in a stupid frat i would be swimming in women, why do girls liek frat guys those guys are thick headed they wouldnt be able to maintain a healthy relationship if i pointed a gun to their heads, everyone in austin drives horribly. I swear its almost as if they want to run pedestrians over each time i walk home. fuck them i would have no remorse killing anyone running me over or even try a sad attempt to kill me. i feel im going to be around for a long time. i hope god will always forgive me for things i do, i love god its just hard to include him in my life all the time. my girlfriend just called me she almost told my brother she had period god that would been awful thank god. i hate cell phones they hurt my head oh now its breaking up whata  surprise. my girlfriend  always calls at bad times i find myself rarely needing to talk to her all it end up is doing something i  don't want to do. ugh shut up tracy i don't care go  jamba juice  soudns good right now. i hope punctuation doesnt matter  my computer is so old. thursday night at club 607 was such a waste of time, i saw stupid mexican trash pissing on an escalade i hate mexican trash i feel fine openly saying this because guess what im one of them except i actually have whiter skin and better manners and a brain. i am the best damn latin man out there if only more girls knew, if only i knew spanish. I love trance music, i have not met anyone who wasn't on drugs who likes my music. I ve never done drugs thank god. i need to go to church but i probably won't anyway i havent been to church probably since christmas. man i want more girls. i hope im not sick i think its just allergies. this computer is really loud but right after this its jamba jucie and warcraft time. violent and realistic video games are the best. my girlfriend really hates thinking about death rape anything violent. we are different in areas sometimes i play video games too much, man if i didnt have to drive her back home with me i could leave so much earlier. fine arts major what a joke. genetics is serious business i love genetics i wish i had more time to study for my genetics quiz this friday. i  hope i did well i really like the teachers at UT they are really accomplished not like the joke profs at UTA i shudder thinking about last yr at UTA.

915,"well here I am in the same predicament. it's interesting how life tends to repeat itself so much. I don't like hearing music while I work. it get's annoying. but allanis morisette is okay. at least she puts some intelligence in her music. but music is distracting. I have a hard enough time sorting out all of the conflicting thoughts and emotions in my head as it is. I don't need music in there screwing things up while I'm trying to work. some people like listening to music while they work. perhaps they just don't have as much running through their minds as I do. I keep thinking of a million things all at once -- a million things that I neeed or want or should do. but will I ever get to them?  sometimes I think I will never be bored. I would love that sensation. to be bored. to think, ""hey, I have nothing better to be doing right now than just sitting around. ""  that would be so wonderful. but perhaps it is impossible for me. perhaps I will always find something to do. there is never going to be a time that I am devoid of all interest, all motivation, all desire to do SOMETHING that my mind tells me should be done. even if I had no school work, even if I finally unpacked all the crap in my room left over from the move. even if there was no one left to email, write, or call. even if all that happened, which it never will, then I'd need to finally get started on one of my many self-initiated ""projects. ""  to learn more about religion -- especially mine. to teach myself how to play the piano, and the guitar, and the violin. to understand women. ha. I'd never finish that project. so perhaps my life consists of perpetual preoccupation. this is a stream of consciousness. I'm supposed to transcribe the thoughts as they run through my head. how is that possible?  that's like trying to describe what happens on each roadway in america all at once. there are too many streamS of consciousness. there isn't just a singular stream. I could talk about the countless thoughts of how busy I am, how stressed my life is right now. I could speak of my love interests, my friends, my relationships with others past and present. I could speak of the things I want in life -- the never ending flow of ""man I want to do that someday""s. I could gripe. I could gripe about anything and everything. I could turn philosophical. I could question. I could write my stream of consciousness about me thinking of any one of these things. yet I am thinking of them all at once. so how do I transcribe that?  and then I look at the clock. ten minutes gone by. I have just put into words a small part of ten minutes of my thoughts. it's interesting how I love to write. it's such a peculiarly interesting thing. I wish I had written more as a kid. I wish I had kept a journal. I did for a while. it's amazing to see you misspell simple words, write so stiffly that the page seems like stone. but still, it's you. it's how you were long ago and how you have changed to what you are now. one excerpt of time. what piece of time. on paper. people talk of time machines, yet we all know they are physically impossible. the closest we will ever get is a little journal and the words that describe what the pen felt from the emotions of the heart. but back to time. I can never stay on one subject in my mind for very long. perhaps that's why I find it hard to sit still for long amounts of time and read. I wish I had more time. I wish I could make everyone happy. I think I could if I had the time. I'm trying to finish my reading. but my friend wants to go out. hell, it's 11:30 at night, and I wanted to get up at a decent time tomorrow. I never get anything done it seems when I start my day at three in the afternoon. but he wants to go out. I guess I should; it's saturday night. but hell, I went out every night this week it seems. why should I go out this night as well just because it's saturday. I should stay and work. I guess it's good though that he asked me to go out and I said yes. if I hadn't of been waiting for him, then I wouldn't have thought right now of the fact that I need to finish this writing assignment.  argh!  I can't stand not to proofread things. I'm such a perfectionist. I had to make sure that word was spelled right. I can't allow myself to not proofread something. even though it seems that's part of the point of this assignment -- to not look back and simply type. that's near impossible for grammar nuts, it's a sin. but I guess I will force myself to hit that submit button in about one minute when my twenty minutes are up. crap!  that sentence ended on a preposition. again, these things just can't happen with my writing. but I will rebel; I will leave it be. I will just accept things for what they are and move on. (another preposition)  perhaps I should act my life out that way. just let things be, accept them as they are, go with the flow, man. maybe if I didn't worry so much things would be much easier. I stopped worrying about the music and it didn't bother me until I thought about it again. I guess I should relax in life. I guess I should go out and have fun and forget about staying in and getting caught up on my work. I guess I shouldn't proofread this. I guess I should just hit that submit button. ",0
45,"I've done alot of self-analysis lately. I realize a few things about myself. I'm a bit obsessive and I believe that may hinder the growth of my current relationship The person I started dating is a wonderful guy, but I take all the small things to heart His dealing with a alot of coming out issues and that makes it much harder on him. The  nature of the relationship itself is freaky even for me here is this guy. I've been  best friends with him for three years now. He and I have been roommates for about two years and it's like all of a sudden the doors of our relationship have flown open. He is now doing things that before I didn't imagine with him. He was a friend now he's something. Do I want this? Yes, I guess. I have talk to numerous people about  this, like Renee. She is a wonderful friend. Her whole entire existence revolves around  one thing right now. Sex! It seems to be a common search for people our age. What if you settle for less, because emotionally that person is so well suited to you. Is that bad or good. I view that as okay. I need reach within myself and learn whether or not. Settling  for less is good or bad. I do know one thing. I do great work, when motivated. I become more goal orientated lately. Setting one tasks and completing it well. It is time consuming  but I believe it will be more beneficial to those I serve. I've been struggling to pick a major  and right now I don't know. I'm so lost I really just need some direction. This school year  has just been really confusing. My whole life has changed in a matter of one month, but I'm happier. Happiness is really a weird word. I think sometimes it just adding a little bit of energy to a  doomed project. Who knows time to reconsider my thought and self image. Life would be easier,  if there wasn't some guy up there scrambling our thoughts. I don't believe in a higher being, but  maybe there is a higher bean. hehehehe!!!! I used to believe in God then during some ""clarity"" I thought who would do right by making animals who feed off of each other. Either emotionally,  physically or mentally, finding those symbiotic relationships I guess is one of life's little hills we must all conquer. I love life! ",0
2302,"our world is pretty fucked up. I've been watching and reading the news lately, and that is the only thing my mind is consumed with. well not the only thing, but almost the only thing. the world has enough problems with natural disasters, why do we have to create more disasters for ourselves. between hurricane Frances and soon to be hurricane Ivan, why do we need Chechen rebels, and radical terrorists, and radical governmental regimes to make things worse. why is it that people can't seem to answer to the moral code everyone knows in the heart to be right. be it a Christian, a Muslim, or an atheist, every person on this earth knows the difference between right and wrong. so why is that not only do terrible things like this happen, but also, others make excuses about it too?  ""they're religious. they're unstable. they're on medication. they've had a hard life. man fuck that. people need to first take responsibility for their actions, and secondly they need to realize that what is right is right and what's wrong is wrong. I don't understand this blur of morals and truth. how have we allowed this world to sink to a level where the average human being doesn't know the difference between right and wrong?  I suppose I'll get off my soap box now, I just can't fathom the world getting worse, and yet I know that tomorrow, will be even just a little bit worse than today. the only thing I can do is try and change my own actions, my own beliefs, and hopefully lead by example. so I was just reading bush has tried cocaine, while bush senior was president. ha. that makes me laugh, I say more power to bush, he says he's clean, I believe him, I don't think his past should be this big of an issue, especially when he is running against john Kerry. I don't even want to vote, but I feel its my duty. so who am I going to vote for?  its like picking the lesser of two evils?  and which one is lesser of a SOB than the other one?  man I don't know. I suppose I'll vote for bush, being that this is Texas. but I don't know if I'd feel right about that. maybe I'll just write in a vote. I mean I know all of Texas electoral votes are going to bush so does it even matter?  maybe I'll run for president one day?  naw, I doubt it, I'm not moderate enough. not that I'm a radical, just that I don't think I could say things to appease one person or another. I have my beliefs and damn it, I'm sticking to 'them. that doesn't mean I'm not open to listening and even changing them based on solid arguments, but I'm not going to change them based simply on needing more votes, that's a fucked up way of doing business. this feels good by the way. I'm sitting at a coffee shop and there are two frat daddies in front of me, they're very loud and annoying. I kind of want to say something to them, but then again they're very large men, and, since I'm making snap judgments, they're probably alpha males who would want to fight me. so I'll just let them be. my friend broke up with her boyfriend recently. they're a couple years older than me, and I'm pretty sure he wanted to marry her. she dumped him because she didn't feel ready for that and needs time to get her life together. I can understand and appreciate where she's coming from, but he was tore up about it. anyway, they're here and talking about stuff, I can tell things are getting intense. I didn't even know they were going to be here, and technically I was here first so I suppose they invaded my space but its no big deal. she will probably start crying soon, and he will just shake his head because he doesn't know what to do. man, I feel sorry for them both. he just wants to love her, be there for her. and she doesn't want to hurt him, but she has no choice, she isn't in the same place he is. love is a funny thing. love is a fucked up thing too. I've only been in love once. and I've fallen out of love once. its a painful process. but then again, I wouldn't replace it. it was a profitable, great, shitty, learning experience, one that I can completely support. so why is it that humans love?  or choose to love?  or choose not to love?  I'd like to be able to love someone again, that's a good feeling. to be able to call someone and just talk to them. see how their day was, what they've been up to, and to know that they wanted to talk to you, and ask you about those same things. I wonder what my wife will be like?  I wonder when I'll meet her. my brother and his girlfriend are close to getting married I think. I may be wrong, but I doubt it. I think they're both in a place where they're ready to commit for the long haul. that's kind of scary. hey, my brother is going to be married forever. I'm going to have a sister in law. maybe I'll be an aunt or uncle soon. now that is really weird. its crazy how time moves. I feel like graduation was a long time ago, but at the same time I feel like I still think and act like a 6th grader. oh 6th grade, those were good days. I thought I was the coolest kid in the world. and at the time, I may have been right. I was one cool 6th grader. it rained today. I love the rain, its so refreshing, so new, so clean, so pure. it makes me appreciate the day that much more. I've spent a total of almost 7 hours at this coffee shop today. reading, writing, talking, thinking, listening, all things I can support 100% though, so it hasn't been a wasted day in the least. I ate at freebirds today too, that was so good. I'd say the feeling I have after I eat freebirds is one of the closest feelings I'll ever have to being completely content, lacking absolutely nothing in the world. because when I've finished freebirds, I don't even desire love, because I am so full and content I don't need anything else. its a good feeling. I'm thinking about what I'm thinking about writing. if that makes sense. it is supposed to be stream of consciousness, and I'm working on that, but I think that I'm thinking too much about it. I've had pretty streaming thoughts up to this point, now I'm thinking too hard about writing something. its ok though, because I only have like 15 seconds left. maybe I'll eat cookies later tonight, I bet those will good ",0
2326,"Okay dokey here we go. just thought I would get this assignment out of the way before I'm overloaded with other stuff. Or either put off until the last minute. I hate when I do that. Must not do that any more you know you can tell yourself that repeatedly but that doesn't mean that it is going to happen. My past shows oh well. Man my stomach hurts just got done eating a salad and now omg pain. Why is that these days it seems like my stomach can't handle anything without getting upset gross. Oh well listening to a new cd I got this weekend and I'm liking it. The band was really good live too ill just have to go out and see them again sometime. Omg this is a lot of writing for only 3 min. I feel bad for the people who are going to read all the students papers. 20minutes of writing never seemed like so much well. Now that I'm actually doing it I'm sure that there is going to be a few pages worth. Once for another UT experiment I had to do this too and it was hand written for 20min I much better prefer the typing (is that even proper English. Note to self again. Work on grammar) ohm well at the other UT experiment that I was doing. I was in high school and they put me in the back o f the library (never can spell that word) and told me to write about whatever it is we wanted for 20min. Well there I am sitting writing away thinking to myself wow I've been writing for a long time. Why haven't they called me up yet. But I never saw the start time. And sadly I ended up writing for 40min. That is a lot especially be hand. These days everyone it seems is so dependent on computers. Good at times bad at other. Only 14 minutes to go. This has to be by far the most enjoyable assignment I have received so far. I think I enjoy writing it seems to be relaxing. I think I shall start writing in a journal again. Although I only seem to write in my journal when I'm angry and htne lock it away until another god awful days comes along. Maybe I should start again but this time maybe daily or so. Everyone says it is a stress reliever. Ha-ha this cd is cute. The lyrics crack me up at times. He is talking about how the bank classifies him as ""poor"" because he doesn't have much money in the bank. And believe me I know how that feels. Grrrr I need to get some source of income. Seriously. Well my stomach is feeling better I wonder what the deal was. Omg today after class. Since I'm to stub run to wait for the bus I walked up the HUGE hill to c panking and today for the first time with a back-pack full of books!! OMG the walked own the hill doesn't compare to the walk up. I thought I was going to die ha-ha but I guess its a good work out plus the what 50pounds of books Hahira damn good work out. Man 9 minutes to go. Good thing this essay isn't graded on grammar or spelling because I think I am the worst speller (that doesn't even sound like the right word) in the world. But and English teacher of mine once told me that bad spelling is a sign of intelligence. Hahahaha ironic. He was a great teacher though I really miss his class. He had a way of making the (at the team high school) students look at the world with open eyes. More mature eyes . Ha-ha and he would through in dark humor every once in a while . Woke the class up. Great teacher. I've actually loved all my English teachers in high school although I am horrible at writing and reading. But their classes were challenging and fun. Everything else in school was to much of a breeze for me. Although NOW at UT I'm a little scared. I hope I can handle it. I think as long as I can make it past the first year I should be able to have the hang of it and do fine the next couple of years . Right ha-ha. You know what this assignment reminds me of. The new TV show THE DAYS. How the teenager dude sits in his room and writes in his journal ha-ha too cute. Didn't dugie houser (can't remember if that is his name or not) do the same thing. Aww poor guy since he was  a doc at such a young age. Don't you ever wonder if kids like that  miss out on their childhoods. I feel bad for them. Seeing ym younger bro and sis grow up hurts because now I know they are going to be exposed to the real world. And they will no longer have that innocence and purity as they once did. The real world is harsh. Man if I could be 13 again I sure would. Yet when I was 13 I remember wanting to be 16 and then wanting to be 18. And not that I'm turning 19. Ohm DEPRESSING. Last year to be a teenager. Although I never really did all the teenage stuff. It was all to immature for me. But soon I'm going to be 20 and that means. Reaching adult. You can't be called a kid anymore. All though I love to call people kid all the time its the greatest. people should call each other kid again maybe peoples outlook on life wouldn't be so scary. Well 20min up. I bet I look like I have ADD. prob. do. Ha-ha  ",1

1128,"For the past couple of weeks, I have been wondering about one question: Why am I here? As I go from class to class I look around at all the other students just like me standing around like they are waiting for something. What are they waiting for? Should I be waiting for something? A lot of changes have happened to me in the past 3 weeks. As these changes take place, I wonder, ""I guess this is what everyone is supposed to do. Everyone gets caught up in doing what is expected from everyone else. If I were to ask someone as I walk by, ""Why are you here at UT?"" an overwhelming majority would probably reply by saying, ""I don't know"" or ""That's a good question. "" So with that said, I ask myself, ""Why am I here?"" I guess the reason for everyone to go to college is to make a higher salary than someone who doesn't go. If that is true then why is it that some of the richest people in the world did not go to college? Michael Dell is a prime example. He is not your everyday college dropout. He is making more money than probably 97 percent of college graduates. So is college a way of evening everyone out? Someone could have had big dreams of starting their own business and carrying out the American Dream; whereas someone else could be forced to go to college by their parents, end up graduating in the middle of the class, but still hold the same kind of job as the person who wanted the American Dream, but got it spoiled by being ""brainwashed"" in college. So what exactly does ""brainwashed"" mean? Everywhere I have been in college, there are professors talking about, ""When you graduate, you can get a job at a big important firm and then you'll be set for life. "" NONSENSE. I don't want to work for someone. Nevertheless, everyone starts to agree with these statements and go to a business, get an ok  paying job, settle with where they are, and never look back to see where they took the wrong turn. I don't want to have to ""use"" my degree when I ""get a job. "" I want to hire other people to use their degree. On second thought, I'm glad professors tell college students to find a job with a big company when they graduate. That big company is going to be me. ",1
588,"I am a sophomore at UT. I am very excited about doing this assignment because I just received my email account. The whole technology thing really amazes me. I am very excited about taking this class because I am interested in the study of people and how their minds work. I am a little undecided on my major, and who knows:  this may be my calling. Well, maybe!  This is very fun for me being here on the world wide web. I feel like I've been in the dark for so long. I'm sitting here wondering what the people around me are doing?  Are they browsing or doing actual work. My guess is that they're doing important stuff, like I am doing. I'm looking forward to exploring other websites after this because like I said this is my first time on line. Now I can talk to my international friends and actually be in contact with my professors and teaching assistants. I have no idea how I made it through a whole year without an account. I guess that's why I missed a lot of posted assignments. O. K. now my hands are getting tired because it's been a whole summer since I've actually done work. But let me tell you it was a pretty exciting summer. I saw friends that I haven't seen in a while and had some wild and crazy times. I should have gone home to save money, but instead I stayed in a very expensive apartment on West Campus and spent all the money I worked so hard for on bills, etc. I am a waitress at Cafe Serrano's. It's a bit fun at times, and I make money on occasion. It really makes my whole opinion and view of people change. I mean, I really try to respect everyone for who they are, but when you're constantly waiting hand and foot on a bunch of stingy, angry people it kind of gets you down on people as a whole. It's a fun environment behind the scenes. I have some fun times with some great friends. We goof off and joke around, and we even hang out after work. I'll have to cut back on the hanging out part with school starting again. My boss thought it was a good idea to work me 50 hours this week. So, I'm pulling my hair out here. I'll tell her tomorrow that I cannot work this much while taking classes. I'll have a nervous breakdown. I do need the hours to pay bills, but I might be able to make it with only a few shifts a week. After all waitressing pays pretty good money when the business is there, you know. If all else fails, I'll beg my parents for a loan. whew now my hands are really tired. I realize that this is nothing compared to some of the stuff I will be writing; however, I still need to get warmed up for the semester. God, I can't wait until Christmas break. I love the holidays so much. I'm never in such a good mood as I am then, unless I have just been dumped by the man of my dreams which doesn't happen every year but it does and that is wh6y my feelings towards men is a very negative one. Actually I love the opposite sex, but at the same time I want to kill every one of them. Actually I am just waiting for Mr. Right and when I settle for Mr. alright for now that's when the crap hits the fan. Well it's been fun but my time's up. I guess I'll visit next time for assignment 2. Later! ",0
1999,"so I don't really know what to type about. I hope this does not have to be like grammatically correct or anything because I don't ever use capital letters. twenty minutes is a really long time. I don't know if I can even type that lone. I don't know if I ever have in my entire life without stopping or taking a break. is weird to write down what I'm thinking because I think I try to think about what to write so I'm not completely sure this is really what I'm thinking. I hope no one reads this too carefully. so its always been really cold in my room but now its kind of hot. I think this could be a good way to vent some of my feelings. I keep thinking about kurt and I wonder if I should call him back or not. everyone keeps saying to never call him back because he only called me because rachel is in dallas but I don't even think for sure that he called because he wants to get back together maybe he just wanted to explain since he never did. I think my foot is falling asleep. I almost wish I had a desktop computer so that this keyboard was not so small. my hand keeps hitting the mouse while I type and it waves around in front of what I'm writing and that makes it hard to concentrate. anyways, I don't want kurt to think that I have been sitting around hoping that he would call or anything because at first a pop up just came up on my screen. I didn't think they would bother me that much but its starting to get on my nerves esp. ok so this other thing just popped up and it said to hold down enter for ten seconds to see some cool thing and I didn't want to because with all my pop ups I figured it would just lead to porn or something of the likes so I tried to push the little x in the corner and it wouldn't close and then it went to some screen with stars or something and said enjoy your break now get back to work. at first I thought it was for this maybe it was but then I got back to this screen and my time was starting all over. that sucks. I hope this is over soon. anyways I'm still thinking about kurt. no one can assume that he called me back because he wants to get back together. he could just want to talk. he did say the first time that he just called to see how I have been. and I'm still mad at him for what he did but I do want to forgive him because I just don't want something like that hanging over me forever and I hate to hold grudges. and I do want us to be friends and I know it would be hard for me to say I didn't want him back but even if that is what he wanted I wouldn't do it no matter how hard because of what he did to me. plus I'm in college and I don't need to have a boyfriend back home. I need to meet people. but I really do miss him a lot. I hope it gets easier. which is part of why I will call him because I really need to close that part of my life and end it and I can't think of the word but something like finalize it. I hope my battery does not die on my laptop and I hope that another popup does not come and mess up my time again because I really need to get this done. I have a lot to do today. but I'm glad I got done what I did this morning. I need to find out about the whole football ticket draw thing. and I hope I wrote down in my planner about that trig review class. then I have all those small chores that I have to do tonight but I don't think ill have time especially since this is taking so long. I have never experienced a longer twenty minutes than this in my life. at least I should be improving my typing skills. I hope it rains this weekend or even today. no maybe tomorrow because ill be outside today. I can't wait until it get cooler outside so I can walk places. yeah right like I really will but maybe I really will. I have taken the stairs up to my room a few times. I think I may fall asleep after this or maybe even right now. I need to move my leg this hurts. wow I'm really really sleepy o I also need to remember to call joey back tonight before I call back kurt. I feel so bad I hope he is not mad at me for ditching them but I needed to go out with christi because we hadn't really done anything together. and I'm glad I did because that was a lot of fun. but I do hope he is not mad or anything and we can get together later. I wonder if I should join the texas exes. I don't know if this is really what I'm thinking because I know in the back of my head all I'm really thinking about is how much I hate typing all this and how I can't wait until its over but at least I'm doing it today instead of tomorrow night so ill have it done and don't have to worry about it. I'm going to try and not procrastinate. bad start though I'm only on chapter one in psychology those chapters are so long and boring I hate that book. I hope this does not deduct points. I wonder if I should stop now since that pop up messed up my timer. oh well I only have about four minutes left anyways so I might as well keep going. o I need to go tanning tonight too. ahhhh I have so much to do tonight and most of it involves reading that damn psychology book o and I have to read that philosophy book. I really like my schedule how it is though that is nice that I don't have any real classes today so I can get caught up. yay I'm almost finished good because I'm really sleepy now and I want to take a nap even though there is no way that I really have time for that but maybe I will anyways just like a few minutes to rest my eyes yeah right ill fall asleep and probably won't wake up until like nine or ten I spell out numbers because I don't know what keys to use yay I'm finished ",0
257,"I am sitting here in the computer lab of my dorm at SRD, even though I  have a computer in my room. I have been too lazy to go buy a network card in order to get the internet on my computer. I have absolutely no idea how to use the internet. In fact, some girl at my dorm had to show me how to get onto this website. Hopefully, I will be able to learn how to use it pretty soon, especially for this class. I don't think I'm going to do very well in this class because I don't know anything about psychology. If my study habits don't improve, then I might not do very well in any of my classes. My math class is kicking my butt!!!!  I have tried so hard to do my homework, but I don't know how to do a lot of it. I have a test on Friday and I know I'm not going to do very well at all. I need to do good on this test since it is the first one in the class. I don't know what to expect on college tests because I never really had to study in high school. I just got off the phone with my best friend from home; she is a year younger than me. I miss her so much. She is the one person that I can talk to for hours about nothing. I was supposed to go home in two weeks to see her, I can't. She was upset when I told her. I promised her that I would be home to see her in three weeks though. My sorority is Delta Gamma, and it is so much fun. I have so much going on in the next two weeks with my sorority, which is why I can't go home to see my best friend. All the girls are so sweet and I know I'm going to like it a lot. I am very excited about being in Austin because in Mt. Pleasant, there is nothing to do ever. We get excited about going to a nice restaurant to eat. My home town is  pretty small; it only has about 13,000 people. Everybody in the whole town knows whenever something happens. The high school football games are the entertainment for Friday nights. I guess there are some good points about living in Mt. Pleasant though. I have some of the best friends I've ever had from my home town. Also,  I get excited about little things that girls from big cities don't get excited about. My classes have more people in them than all of my graduating class. I am amazed that there are so many people at this college!  I didn't really get lost on the first day, mainly because I looked at my map for two days. I am about to go work out because I don't want to gain the freshman fifteen like everyone says I will. I  don't have room on my body to gain any more weight!!!!  I don't really watch what I eat though. I do some exercises and I walk a million miles to class everyday. How do people gain weight here whenever classes are a  million miles apart?  I am so tired because it is late at night, but I wanted to get one assignment over with early. My twenty minutes is almost up. I have so much to do tomorrow; I have class from 11 to 5. I am dreading it. Then I have a meeting at 6:00 and I have to study for math. I am going to sixth street tomorrow night if I get through studying in time. Well, my time is finally up and I am so proud of myself for getting this done on time because I usually procrastinate.                                           ",1
1911,"Well here I am in the Undergraduate Library writing my Stream of Consciousness     paper. I still haven't really figured out yet what I will write about, but I suppose that     this type of paper isn't really supposed to have a meaning. That's good I guess,     right. Sure. It's cold in the computer lab here. It's always cold in this lab. And it's     always cold in the library. In most places throughout the University, in fact, it is     cold. It is especially cold in the student union. I mean -- ridiculously cold. it must     be about 70 degrees in there. There is one place, however, that I have found is     not cold - it is hot. My calculus class in the experimental sciences building it really     warm. And it doesn't really help that it is still like 90 degrees outside. One thing I     have noticed though, is that it is getting a little cooler outside. This is very good     news. Hopefully it will continue to get cooler. So looking at the timer at the top of     this page, I am beginning to realize that a twenty minute writing is quite a long     time, especially when you consider the fact that I really have no topic, nor have I     even begun to write on a topic. It's just meaningless facts from my mind. I'm sure     that this has some kind of meaning - this writing I mean. There must be some     point for this. Hopefully at least. So far my classes have been pretty good. I don't     have a huge workload yet. I assume that it will pick up eventually. Especially next     semester. From Laurel's experience, I have a feeling that next semester will be     quite a bit tougher than this one. Actually, I am quite certain that it will be rough. I     will be taking differential equations -- which Scheffer said was hard --  and     physics, which I know will be hard. Oh well, I can handle it. I am enjoying school,     though. It is quite a bit different than anything else I have experienced this far in     my life. All the freedom and extra time. I just like the atmosphere that is college. It's fun and different. Well only five minutes have gone by so far. I'm still a little     hungry. I should have had more lunch. Oh well. I only have one more class, and     it starts in 45 minutes and is only an hour. That's not too bad. I am writing on a     Macintosh computer right now. I didn't particularly want to use one, but it was     available, so I took it. They aren't too bad I suppose. It would take a little getting     used to. And the keys are quite a bit more sticky than I am used to. And the fact     that the mouse has only one button it a little odd. But the thing that I find most     interesting is the fact that Microsoft Internet Explorer is on an iMac. I had always     wondered if Microsoft put out programs on Apple's. Quite interesting indeed. Now     I'm pushing the 9 minute mark. Looking back, this is quite a bit of stuff I have     written in the last nine minutes. All pretty meaningless though. I think I may just     stop looking at the clock for a while because it is a little depressing. You know the     feeling - staring at the clock makes time just crawl by. Quite annoying I must say. During swim practice we used to not like to look at the clock because it would     remind us of how much time we had left in practice. Especially with Coach Hutch. Man he was a killer. I think that was the hardest year that I ever had with     swimming. Funny thing is -- I didn't get a whole lot faster. I got faster with coach     Wilson -- as much as I hate to say it. OK I give -- I looked at the clock. Now I only     have nine minutes left to write. That's promising I guess. I wonder how the swim     team is doing now. With the girls and the guys separated and all. I wonder if the     girls like the new coach, and how the guys are dealing with Kyle again. The guy     behind me has more I'M's up than I have ever seen. He seriously must be talking     with at least ten people - probably more. The whole screen is flashing  and     lighting up all the time. Crazy. This whole Macintosh thing is kind of getting to me. I can't stand this keyboard. It is so sticky!  Every other word, I have to go back and     fix it because the key didn't register. I also keep going back because I keep     forgetting to add capital letters and such. I am used to a program fixing it all for     me. Oh well I suppose it's good for me. But this sticky keyboard is not. Geez!  If     you can't tell, it is starting to bother me. And they crazy IMer is still typing away to     like 50 of his closest friends. It's funny what you notice people do when you just sit     back and watch for a minute. (6 minutes left)  One good thing I will say is that     Macintosh's do look pretty cool. I like the whole clear theme. I also like the     widescreen. It's pretty cool, and is very clear and bright. I think the clock on the     computer is slow. After 20 real"" seconds - by my watch - the clock lost 5 seconds. So for every ""real"" minute, 75 seconds go by. So in a 20 minute writing sample, I     must actually write for about 25 minutes. See I thought this was an abnormally      long time to write. I thought that my watch said 12:01 when I started, and now it is     12:37 and I still have 2 minutes to write. Maybe this thing loses even more time     than five seconds for every twenty seconds. That's crazy. I have a one o'clock     class. I hope that my ""2"" minutes doesn't last too much longer. Well in conclusion,     this writing experience has been. well. real - to say  the least. I have to say that     I have never written a stream of consciousness paper before, so this was a first. I     don't know that I like it that much either. I have noticed that when I type on the     computer that the seconds don't even move at all. So I have been writing for a     loooong time. Ok, my time is up. Bye. ",1
1232,"Okay for 20 minutes hopefully it will go by relatively fast. I have so much to do today studying, and going to workout will probably consume the rest of my day. But I am finally settling into a routine, it's taken a couple of weeks but I am getting the hang of college life. Most of my friends are going home for the weekend but it's too soon for me. I want to stay, besides I went to Dallas last weekend for Labor Day for my sister's birthday. I got to see my best friend Zach who is now in Colorado trying to wrestle. But I am not anxious to go home just yet, especially since I will there the first weekend of October for TXOU and the Santana concert. Then later that month my mom and my sisters will be coming to see me here at school. My oldest sister Maggie is bringing her new fiance. I haven't met him yet, but he must be a good guy if she has chosen to marry him she of all people would not stand to be burnt twice. They both have to go get annulments from their previous marriages so they can be wed in a Catholic church. Catholicism is kind of funny that way I come from a very strong Catholic family and my father would rather have preferred me to attend the University of Dallas which is Catholic and not Liberal UT. However, my parents strategically placed my in Dobie, next to the university Catholic center. Smart people. Little do they know the last time I went to church was when I was in Dallas. My dad also really pushes me to become a doctor which is what I have wanted to do for the majority of my life. But last spring, architecture was really introduced to me and now I am in Dean Speck's architecture class which is fascinating I love it. Who knows when I'll figure out what I want to do, I do have the feeling that no matter what I decide to do that I'll probably endure some sort of midlife crisis and completely change my career. But that's okay with me, there are a lot of people who do that. My sister Jennifer, for example, is 29 and is about to take her LSAT and apply to law school. She is even applying to UT Law that would be cool if she was down here too. I like being on my own though and not really having the responsibility of worrying about her. It's not that she places that responsibility on me but I am the closest to her out of my family so I am usually the one in the middle trying the best way to help her alcoholism and depression. Yeah, she's applying to law school. At least she has some sort of direction. It's hard for her to hear the truth. But I slammed it down her throat this summer and I think it hit her. I wonder when Kim is getting home. I think she said 5:00. I like having the whole suite to myself though I can actually get some stuff done. We have to go later to the house and put in some study hours with Reese. Reese is probably lonely without Jessica around to bug her. I hope I get her as my Diamond Sister, that would be really cool. Kim is going home this weekend along with the rest of the world to see Dave Matthews Band one of my favorites. I have seen them in concert before and tickets are expensive so I don't think I am going to go. Unless my boyfriend can find some relatively good priced lawn tickets not likely. I'd like to see everyone then again it's too soon to come home. I miss my dog. It took me 17 years to get a dog and I finally get the most perfectly adorable black lab and I leave for school. I'll probably breed labs when I'm older I love Labs and I don't see why I'd ever have any other kind of dog. My suitemates are really organized I am typing on Amy's computer and I'm noticing how clean her desk isooh, I'm done! ",1
2089,"I don't know if I'm still mad at my friend. I hope she never does it again but somehow I think it'll take longer for her to change. Should I leave her alone or still hang out with her?  I'm getting tired of taking care of everyone. I don't know whether I want to go clubbing or go home this weekend. I sort of want to go home and get more food because I'm getting tired of the american food here. I don't hate olivia and I think its stupid that all these people hate her for no other reason than other people hating her. I think its very immature and you should get to know a person before judging her. I'm worried about my friend who is always taking drugs and she thinks its really cool. I had a writing assignment like this in high school. My psychology teacher in high school was so boring because she had a monotonous voice and she . I don't know but is very strange. I miss my high school life but I still prefer my college life. In high school everything seems controlled because my parents placed restrictions on my life but now here, its different because there is no one to control me. I sort of like this new freedom because my parents were really strict at home. I never got to stay out late but now, I could do whatever I want. I'm just afraid that I might mess up my schoolwork here at college. I don't want to mess up because I want a bright future but then I also want to experience and have fun my college years. So I have to learn how to set priorities to my life. I miss my high school life and I know that I could never go back to it. But I feel like I have truly lived my senior year of high school. High school was fun because I made friends I know I would keep for a lifetime. They are the ones I would call up if I'm upset or the ones I don't mind crying to. But in college, I feel like, no one really gives a damn about you unless you had some history with them. My classmates here, we're all in competition and the only ones I could turn to for now are the friends I had in high school. I just feel more comfortable being around them because I know that they've seen me through a lot of situations. I wish I could make more friends here at UT because its such a big campus and I want to be well connected. So I have started going to CBS and that's helping a lot I think not only because I meet people there but also it calms me down. Because thurs night I went clubbing and after that I still felt wild but now I'm ready to settle down and work hard in college. I don't want any regrets. I wish I could also find a boyfriend here at UT so I have someone I could rely or depend on. Because I'm tired of being depended on all the time. The ideal kind of guy would probably be a guy younger than me I would totally go for him. I wish it was summer, I like this UT campus because it just feels like home. It fits, because at home I'm always counting the days until I left home but now that I'm at uT I'm enjoying my days here. I don't usually like writing stuff like this because sometimes I feel like its a waste of time. I rather talk it out to someone so they can endure the pain of listening as well. Does someone actually read this?  Because this would be a lot of reading to do. not only to read my writing but also to read everyone's elses writing. What is the purpose of this writing?  I'm almost done, five more minutes of just rambling. This is like xanga. Everyone on there just rambles on forever about their day and their thoughts. Do they feel any different after they finish writing?  Well. xanga's are interesting to read when I'm bored but I don't think I would ever have one just because I don't want to waste my time on that and that I don't want to post up my personal life. I'm running out of stuff to say, I have never consider myself to be a very talkative person. Even to other people. I wish my roommate would get her internet port fixed because I'm tired of her always having to use my computer when she does something. Even if it was for schoolwork, I'm really anal about people touching my computer. Should I go and help her yell at the people who fixes computers because I want her to get it fixed now but she just seems to drag it. Is that selfish of me?  Well. I'm again running out of stuff to say and I have approx one more minute. My goals for college is to succeed I don't want to fail because its so much harder to climb back up again once you fall. Yay. almost time. 30 more sec. blah blah    20 more sec    I feel like an idiot just rambling here. ",0
1293,"What is going through my head. hmmm. That's a good question. Well. I feel really skeptical about this whole college thing. I mean its all cool and all but I get a little intimidated by the whole process. I mean all these people in my classes kind of freak me out. I am used to dealing with large amounts of people but WOW. I sit there and wonder how the professors do it all. I mean yes, they have teacher's aides, but I am sure that the work is tremendous. All the schoolwork is a little new to me. I am used to a lot of busy work and worksheet. Don't get me wrong. I was in advanced classes, but I am not that used to every class having mandatory readings all the time. I am also a little scared of going out. I was always a social person in high school but the whole going out and meeting new people is a little scary. I mean, the people seem really friendly and nice, but a lot of them seem really snobby and a little unapproachable. so it makes a person hesitate. I am really an outgoing girl but I hesitate for some reason here. In other environments, I usually don't. It is strange though. It like I am afraid of making new friends. How silly is that??? Also, I am afraid of the whole freshman 15 thing. I mean, how could people gain weight? You walk around all day and go to class. And when you're not doing that you are reading or going out? Well, I know the food isn't that great, but 15 pounds! Wow! Also, this whole party scene is a bit intimidating for me. I want to go, but I am so scared because of all the storied I've heard. Funny what you realize when you just sit here and let your mind go. I need to learn to type faster so I can go as fast as I am thinking. Oh well. that's what you get for not taking keyboarding in junior high. Well. I am thinking my 20 minutes of typing is up. So I will check all my spelling and turn this in. ",1
436,"I've spent my second day at the university of Texas and I'm trying not to hate it. I feel lonely and depressed. I miss Wesley, I miss knowing everyone in my classes and what's going on with the school. when I first went to Wesley I hated how your professorss were so involved in your life, but now I know what the other extreme feels like, I really miss it. I kept looking for a familiar face, or even a friendly on, when I was on campus today. everyone looks different that the people in Boston. actually they all look the same as each other just different form the kind of people I know. I feel alienated and unsure - of myself, of the situation, of what to expect. I can't just look at someone and judge who they are and if I'll like them, because I don't see anyone who fits my idea of what ""friend"" should look like. no one looks like me. it was so good to have lunch with Kate yesterday because I didn't feel so alone and different. she looks like people should- I say that joking of course, but I guess I feel like I can understand her motivations, where she's coming form - I mean I know who she is and it's what I expect. I'm so glad she came here too - I don't know what I would do if I were totally alone down here. I think it's really a different experience for me because I've never not had friends, or had any trouble meeting people, but here I don't even know how to start. there are a million people in most of my classes, and the small ones are upper division, so people already seem to have friends. I didn't expect to miss Wesley so much. I thought it w0ulds be kind of fun to be anonymous, and that there would be a lot more funky people. nearly everyone I've seen is the sorority/frat type and I hate it!  I never thought Wesley was that diverse or funky, but I guess I've realized what I had all along. maybe I'm just remembering things with a rosy glow, or something. I mean I know there are plenty of Wendy Wesley oh-so-perfect women at Wesley who drive me up the wall, but I know how to deal with them. and most of them have at least an open mind, or something interesting that got them to the place where they are now. what else to say?  I just had an argument with my mom and I feel really guilty, I haven't seen her a lot lately and I was really looking forward to seeing her today, but as soon as she started in on about how I should rrahhhh - I hate that. I told her that I was going to use the computer for some web stuff and now she tells me I can't do it, right when I'm in the middle of an assignment. I'm totally annoyed. this just completes my feelings of displacement and loneliness. I'm at acc where I worked this summer and I came here because 1-I have no idea where the computer lab on campus is, and 2- I thought it would be nice to see everyone and feel like I still mattered to someone. now I just feel like hell. I think I want to cry, but I always feel so crappy when I do that - since I usually do it for some really stupid reason, like I feel like a jerk or something. god, I just feel like telling everyone to shove it today!  what a way to start the semester!  ok, I'm trying to think of something a little more cheerful and stop whining. I'm excited about going to the swing dance tonight, but I hope I can. I really want Eric to go, but I'm not sure if I want to want him to go. I hardly know him and he has lots of not-so-great traits. plus, I'm sick of getting hurt. I think I might just like him because he's there and I'm feeling so lonely right now. I don't know if it's right to be with someone just to be with someone. if it's not that serious, would it be that big of a deal?  I'm not sure. I keep going over this in my head - why can't I find the right one?  not the one to marry or anything as serious as that, but one that I really like/  one that fits all the qualifications I want who can entertain and teach me, who's nice and funny and interesting. rrahhh- this is ridiculous. I'm feeling really stress about the time now that she came over, I can't fully concentrate on what I'm thinking about. it's amazing how your mind rambles in loops or something - one thought brings on another and another until you're thinking about something totally different than what started the ramble, and you can't really remember how you got there.

1656,"     I wonder what this stuff is suposed to mean. What can i possibly learn about my self by writing incohearant thoughts for twenty minutes. I'm not a very good typist for one. None too good at spelling either. I hope who ever or what ever machine looks at this can read past any spelling and punctuation mistakes. This computer screne is far too birght. i wish i had thought to fix that before i started this. I wish i could read some other students writtings. Maybe i'd find some insight to how i'm doing in this rat race. Maybe i'd figure out what the girls around here are looking for. how vacant can my mind be? how many mental diseased is this going to uncover in me? i hope there are drugs to fix it. I wish i were at the lake right now. no books, no tv, no phone, just a hamock and a cold drink. Maybe a seadoo. A little bit of water sports never hurt anyone. Accept the ones that crash. God i hope  never see anything like that again. Why did that have to happen, all those kids had to do was go a little bit slower. All they had to do was look around for boats. They could have avoided it and now they are dead just beacause they couldn't understand that a jet ski isn't a toy. A goddamn toy! how could anyone   play   with their life like that. I hope i go in my sleep. i can feel the propeller slicing through my leg right now. those poor bastards. i guess id rather be one of those kids than the poor bastard that hit them though. i could never live with that kind of baggage. they didn't even know where their parents were. for the love of God, what could they possibly have thought when they got that phone call.   MRs smith, your daughters are dead. There was nothing we could do, i guess these things just happen.   and how could the parents not blame the draver of that boat?? how coul anyone ever admit that their childs death was their childs own fault? that all seem a bit bleek. Maybe i am ill. maybe i should get a bike. I could get around alot faster. Maybe i should just leave early, then maybe i could loose some weight. mayeb i've got it all wrong though. maybe they don't even care about that. I should loose some weight anyway. its unhealthy. Who ever reads this thinks i'm a nutcase.  Hello out there. welcome to the inner sanctom of my mind. its cold in here, but you'll get used to it. watch your step, there are some loose screws here and there. don't poke at that, i'm affraid it might fall apart. don't trip on that, its allready fallen apart. i know its messy in here but i'll get it all organized sooner or later.   i need to hire an inner sanctum of the mind cleaning lady. I hear they are very affordable. I guess cheap labor is just a byproduct of his whole immigration mess. maybe that mess has to do with our economic mess, or our terrorism mess. or our youth mess. or our drug mess. who in hell is going to clean up any of these messes? can you do one at a time? or are they all linked together? certainly some are. i'll just let trusty george W. handle it. err, imean cheany  ",0
1666,"     why am i nervous about this assignment, it can't be wrong, i feel like i'm writing so randomly, i'm usually so structured, or am i , i really haven't been lately, i'm so lazy sometimes, like today i didn't want to go to physics class and i just didn't wake up, i think i turned my alarm off, but i'm not 100% sure, i really don't like early early classes, it's such a bum to get up for them, on and on and on, and even if they don't go on like that, it's just such a pain having to get up for them, i mean it's so blessed early, 8:30 in the blamin morning, i mean come on, who wants to be studying physics at that time of morning, it's way to early, way too early, and u'd think that with all the money the university has, it could  get some professors who speak good english, not that they don't know what they're talking about or anything like that, it just seems a little out of place, that's all, this place sure is a mixing pot, names i've never seen before and many i'll bever be able to pronounce, so many people, so many names, just going down the hall and meeting some random person and talking for hours, and bam! u have a friend, or two, or 5 as the case may be, i mean sheesh, this is the place to be, there's just so much to do that u never feel like doing your homework, except this assignment, i actually like this one, it has purposed guised beneath it's apparent randomidity, i really should reconsider my major, i can't stand to get up for calculus, i dread physics and i loath chemistry, but when it comes to things like psychology, government, history, english, i can't wait to get to class, i don't despise having to get to know enough to pass the blamin test, i teach it to others, spend spare time to find the little intricate details that so intrigue my intellect, the adjectives and grammatical spurts that titilate the mind as opposed to the numbers and inferences that wear on one's nerves like grating concrete on your skull, one's a vacation and one's imprisonment, i really should get more sleep, i'm having trouble typing straight, or maybe it's just the rediculously small amount of space i have to write on this little desk with my frankenstein computer, how am i going to afford my chem book,no, not chem, my philosophy book, whoops, great one to put on here, they now think i'm horrible, no i really love psych, i even had it in high school, just haven't gotten the book yet, have to go to the financial aid office to get my mess straightened out, then got to do my blinkin physics homework tonight, jeez, and i've got to get the stupid dart transit thing worked out, they really need more hours in the day or some thing like that, everyone wants money and almost noone will come to dinner, people say they'll call and never do, people say they'll stop by and never do, do i need a message board? will anyone actually use it, or will people erase it if they do? am i paranoid? it's possible, in most cases i'm just prepared and my wrists are getting a little tired from typing in this awkward position, that is with this numbskull desk here, i'll probably get carpal tunnell or something, see even my spelling's going, that's what too much math will do to a person, i honestly don't understand this new calculus course i'm in, since when do mathemeticians make INFERENCES, in these problems we're having to make a whole string of INFERENCES to come a concrete answer? i think not! math is supposed to be about numbers and certainties and the correct technical notation which my TA and professor seem to think is unneccessary, IT IS NECESSARY, i mean come on here, u can't just start putting stuff down and have it be correct, if u don't define it right it could mean anything, i've seen sounder arguments made against abortion in philosophy class than i've seen arguments made for what some limit or sequence is, i thought math was supposed to be the one infallible, untouchable truth because it relied on cold hard unchangeable numbers, but NO, i'm in stinking cal 2 and i've hardly seen a solid number yet, most of what i've seen is shifty half arguments that if used in a court case would set a criminal off scott free, and they claim it to be the language of the universe? if that's so then it's just a confusing and complex a language as english because there's always some exception, some little thing that messes you up, some minor, minute, miniscule tidbit that u miss that makes the entire thing false, give me a break people, and as if it were easy to pay attention in class anyway, with the shorts and shirts the fine UT woment wear, it's a wonder any studying gets done at all, and in the one class i do have a relatively subdued female population, i have a professor that seems like everybody's grandpa and does nothing but write formulas on the board and make side comments about important rules that are already supposed to be common knowledge, NO they are not common knowledge, maybe to u, but u already HAVE your stinkin PhD, we haven't even gotten a bachelor's yet, so stop your assuming, jeez i'm thirsty, u'd think i'd been yelling all this at someone for the past 20 minutes for as dry as my mouth is, in all honesty if someone took the time they could probably findout who wrote this if they really wanted to, it's not like i haven't given enough clues already, well i'm just in the hope and confidence that they won't, oh look, time's almost up, well that was a productive venting section, now if we could only fix all of these problems, oh well, life is life and that's the way it goes, we'll just have to deal ",1
393,"I'm missing my friends as I always do when we're not together. I sort of wish I would have gone to school with my best friend Eliza. I had too much fun this summer and now I'm just really bored with Austin. Even so my classes seem interesting enough. I'm glad I switched majors. My family got a puppy. I told them they should name it Bevo, but I think that that would make my Aggie sister not to happy. I can't wait for my friends to visit me in October. Real stupid, huh. I'm all looking forward to two months from now. I feel kind of bad though, because I think Troy likes me too much and I'm just not interested. I really hope Mandy doesn't get mad at me if I hurt his feelings. Like she is one to judge. I'm really looking forward to going jetskiing, but I really want to go dancing. I can't wait to go to clubbing. I hope Lisa calls me today. She's being a real butthead. Well I guess I understand. We're all having money troubles. I hope I find a job. It's really going to suck if I don't. I'm sort of wondering if someone is going to read this. I really hope not cause I think I sound kind of stupid. I am sort of stupid, but that doesn't mean everyone should know. I hope Danny writes to me soon. I'm going to feel really dorky if I write to him and he never writes back. Bambino. I think I'm going to play a trick on Bert today. He is such a jerk. I cannot believe that he was so rude to me last year. I really expected a lot more from him. I sort of miss our friendship, but I guess that's how it goes. I really miss Eric. I wish it hadn't ended the way it did. I feel like crying now. How is it that you can ever forget someone that you loved so much. It's like he's dead to me now, cause I can never talk to him again. Oh well. I know I would hate it if we got back together. I feel like I'm writing in a diary, but I can't say the really juicy stuff. I want to go to Six Flags. I love amusement park rides. I wish Emily had gotten on the rides with me the last time. It was so funny to see her so terrified. I miss Gerry. I should write her a note today. I hope she still has email. I'm really going to miss her if I can't find her. Gerry is one of the greatest people I know. She is so nonjudgmental. I wish I could see her again. I have to stop procrastinating. I don't know what else to write . . OK  I hope Lisa comes to pick me up soon. I would really like to see her. I am so pathetic. Here it's only been a week and a half and I'm already wanting to see my friends again. I was going to write something, but I forgot. Damn it I hate it when that happens. I hope I make some more friends this year. People who like to do stuff, like Emma. I can't believe she actually took me to Mexico whenever I wanted to go. It's to bad they grounded her at the end of the summer. THAT' ALL FOLKS! ",0
425,"first of all I don't have set prison like rules and regulations. the classes are a lot more laid back and I can do self paced. high school was much more busy work which was crap. I am worried however about how well I do in college. although I did well high school, college is much different. rather than burning the info into you through busy work and assignments, we have to learn on our own. everybody says that they learned more their freshman year than in all of high school. seeing as how I cram all my assignments into the night before it's due, I plan to change dramatically on how my work is done. the influence of my friends also worries me. because of the many groups of friends I don't think I'll have much time to do studying or productive work. I am hoping that by writing all of this down, I am able to recognize my weaknesses and change them before they do any great harm. since this is stream of consciousness I can't help but write about the catcher in the rye, one of my favorite books. since I'm in psychology, I hope that doesn't mean that I'm going to assassinate any powerful people. the book is great written in stream of consciousness and I feel many of holden's feelings. such as the phoniness in society. the phonies in society really piss me off!  back to college, I hope that I can discipline myself and succeed in college. right now I'm listening to red hot chili peppers. I don't know what that tells about me, but I love their older songs. I can make disappear have no fear! music is my airplane, is my airplane. rrahhh!  four more minutes. I don't know what to write. I have so many thoughts but they're not organized. sex of course is on my mind, and since it's the first day of class, that's on my mind. the crazies passing out the Christian leaflets is also on my mind. it really pisses me off. not that their spreading the word, because I'm catholic. what pisses me off is that they're so hypocritical. they go out preaching but then turn around and drink it up (under age) and sleep around (pre marital sex!)  that disgusts me. although I do drink a little, I don't go out preaching. many of my friends are atheists and agnostic. I view many of their views such as religion's role in being a social and moral standard. after all, if there was no fear in sinning  then crime would skyrocket and the moral stability  of society would disappear. while that is true, not all will revert to barbaric life. while there are laws, religion adds more to the discipline in obeying the basic commandments. we've had hours and hours of discussion on religion and god. from these discussions I see that many misinterpretations of the catholic faith exist. for example, many believe that (through the narrow-mindedness of the teachers of their religion) that Catholics worship Mary when in fact we pray through her. they see that as a way of discrediting Catholicism by pointing out verses in the bible stating that ""thou shall worship no other god than me""  or something like that.

Right now I am getting bored in this room because its not mine. They really need a TV in here I couldnÃ¯Â¿Â½t go without one. with no TV and video games I would get bored very easily. I feel like playing pool but I am not that good at it, and it just frustrates me. My brother is the one who can fix my computer so I need to give him a call. HavenÃ¯Â¿Â½t seen him in a while. HavenÃ¯Â¿Â½t seen my sister in an even longer time, need to talk to her too. she always studies and her cats are really cute. Every time I think of my sister, I think of her cats at the same time. Thinking of her cats reminds me of when they were at my house, with my dogs, one of which just died. I miss that dog. WeÃ¯Â¿Â½ve had him I guess since I was in second or third grade, He was eleven, so that would mean weÃ¯Â¿Â½ve had him since I was seven,  thetas a long time, had a dream about him last night, him and my other dog Brittany, who died a year before him. It always makes me sad when I think about those dogs. Now the stereo is playing and it reminds me of how loud this thing can play,  just hearing bass in my room. Gotta stop  hitting the wall when that happens. I need to go out tonight, havenÃ¯Â¿Â½t done that in a while, did my studying, now just need to find some place to go. I wonder how my dad is taking all his kids being off to school. HavenÃ¯Â¿Â½t really talked to him about it and I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t know how to bring something like that up. I really miss my 4 wheeler at home, I loved riding that thing,  I wonder if there is anywhere to ride up here. need to win the lottery so that I can get some more  4 wheelers. my last ride in El Paso was the day before I left, with a friend of mine, who now for some reason I feel a lot closer to. its weird. Cant wait until Thanksgiving so that I can ride. Now all I can think about is that my twenty minutes are almost up and I wonder what I am going to do after IÃ¯Â¿Â½m done here. Probably just kill time until I go and eat dinner. Hope they have something good tonight, because the lunch menu sucked.

I want to see grandma an Aunt Sylvia but I don't know if I can handle a weekend with mom. I guess I can try to get along with her. I hope we go shopping I really need some winter clothes or I going to shiver my butt off all winter. It is cold in here right now but there is nothing I can do about it. The thing is already turned up as far as it will go I don't think it works. I think they only put the thermostat in each room so you think you have control because it is always cold. If the phone rings one more time I'm going to freak. My phone I so loud you can hear it all the way down the hall. It scares me every time it rings. Halloween will be here soon That and New years are the best holidays. I'm going to have to find a costume. Ok its been twenty minutes I'm going to sleep this was interesting and I don't feel like I wrote enough but these were my thoughts. ",1
2053,"I was just typing for like 3 minutes and all the stuff I just typed erased. So now I'm really pissed off. I was writing about my boyfriend and how I miss him and he just called and said he was going to call me back. I am so excited about this weekend cause all my friends in school will be down this weekend and we are going to go out and spend time together. I am so excited. I really don't like it up here I just have to deal with it and get used to it. I get so happy when I get to go home on the weekends. So you could say I am living for the weekends. That is bad I guess but I don't know, I just have to get used to it. I am talking to my friend right now. She is a good friend but sometimes she gets on my nerves cause she can be so fake sometimes. I wish she would just be herself all the time. I wish that some of my friends would come up here. I am ready to go home. I miss my family and especially my mother. She would comfort me right now. I need to read my bible. I am so bored right now. And I'm tired because I stayed up late last night to finish calculus and chemistry. I wish the professors would get together so that we wouldn't have so much homework. I am so bored. My friend is on the phone and she is talking to me lying again. I hate when she lies. She does that all the time. I wish she wouldn't do that. I wish my friend Kim would come up here and go to college with me. I have already made up my mind that if I don't like it by the end of the semester I am going to transfer. I will try to stick it out though. I have calculus homework due Thursday and I am going to have to get my cousin to come help me cause some of the problems I don't know how to do. My calculus teacher moves too fast and even he doesn't know what he did on some days. That is horrible. I can't wait till I get in my major because then my classes will be smaller and I will be able to understand stuff better. Dang!  I didn't know that twenty minutes lasts this long. I have like nine more minutes. I am so bored. As soon as I finish this I am going to sleep. No!  After I talk to my boyfriend. He is coming up here on the 19th and I can't wait. I haven't seen him in a while. I wonder what he is doing right now. My daddy gets on my nerves. He always has something smart to say. He can't never just let stuff be. I wish he wouldn't call sometime if all he is going to talk about is stupid stuff. I am really glad I have church members that care about me. I have received so many phone calls. It really encourages me to know that I have people praying for me. I have to keep reminding myself that I want to be a pharmacist and that I have to do what I have to do to get it. I am so wishing that my six years here would be fast and I will do good and that I won't fail any classes. I want to talk to my boyfriend now, but I am not going to call him until I finish this. Twenty minutes is long, and I didn't know it could be so long. I guess that is when you are wanting time to pass because If I didn't want time to pass it would be going by fast. I really miss my mother. I'm about to read my bible, so I can gain some encouragement. I think I may call my mother before I go to bed or not. I need to quit acting like a baby and start being the grown up that I am and accept my responsibility. I am about  to call my boyfriend. I love him and hope we get married right after I finish school, if we last that long. If not, I wish the best for him in life. But I think we would be good together. We are good together now. Except when we get mad at each other and then we are still good together. I can't wait till wee see him this weekend too. And my family. I'm ready to see everyone. I love being at home. I wish when I was in high school I didn't always want to leave home ",1
1877,"     i'm sitting at the pcl library, i can hear the computers humming, i'm typing kind of fast so i'm worried that people will find this annoying, because i sometimes do and sometimes when i click the mouse too fast some people get annoyed. my feet are really hurting from the bruises i think i got from the car accident on wednesday, i'm wondering if i should go to the university health center and talk to someone about it, but i don't know if i'll have time to go up there, and maybe there's nothing to worry about and bruises will fade by themselves anyway. now i'm thinking about the calculus quiz that i did yesterday, i did really bad on it. i ran out of things to say, i'm really sleepy. my uncle left today i feel bad that i didn't say goodbye but he left so early in the morning back to lebanon, i don't know how long it will be until i see him again but he wasn't as friendly as he was a year ago. i remembered last night that it was my 2 friend's birthdays, it was my brother's too and i didn't get him anything. . i really should have, i should go today, but i'm so concerned about how much money i've been spending lately, i don't work anymore and i'm running out of money i should be careful how much i spend, what will i do when i run out, i can't keep asking my dad for money everytime i want to go out for coffee. i just talked to my friend outside she got married last weekend and i was at her wedding and her husband's best friend really liked me and now he asks about me all the time and he wants to drive down from san antonio to see me but i'm so afraid of it, because i was so attracted to him at the wedding, and i thought about him so much after that,and i kept feeling that i wanted to be with him even though i knew i shouldn't have because i have a boyfriend and i must be loyal to him so that i can allow him to trust me because he's insecure sometimes so i don't know what to do. the guy's name is nathan and he's the kind of guy i would love to have as a friend but i don't think he's going to want to settle it at that and i'm afraid that even if he did, i might want more, which would be horribble because of my boyfriend. i'm not sure about my feelings anymore, i'm so afraid that what happened with my last relationship is going to happen all over because i'm so indecisive about my feelings. now i just want to go to sleep. i'm meeting my boyfriend after i finish writing and we're going out to lunch. i'm not that hungry. i know i should watch what i eat like i used to, but i don't anymore. it's becoming bad for me, i'm not even exercising like i used to. i don't know why, i just feel so tired. i got mad at my mom this morning and i feel bad, because it's not really her fault. well maybe it is, i just don't understand why she can't seem to help me out in the morning when she sees that i'm late, why can't she make me a sandwhich so that i can eat on my way out the door, instead of leaving the house with no breakfast and starving because i don't have time to do it myself. it takes her practically no effort, i don't understand. she must think it's a matter of teaching me to do things on my own but i think that's ridiculous, i just need a little help and she wouldn't do it. i'm looking at the time on the screen and i never realized how slow time can be sometimes. this spacebar on the keyboard is really starting to piss me off, what the hell is wrong with it. i'm getting to impatient, i hate it when it sticks. some people are typing really fast, too, i wonder if they're doing the same thing i am. i can't see their screen. a girl is listening to her headphones, it's a good idea. i wonder if we're allowed to burn our own music cd's, i saw a lady doing it at the ugl library and i really want to. but i asked my older brother and he said we're not allowed because those computers are used only for the scanner. supposedly. i'm swaying my chair right now, it calms me down. i want to listen to some music, the nice relaxing kind i listen to on 95. 5, i love that station. they put old music and it's so relaxing. yesterday i was seriously thinking about wearing a scarf. oh. . no that was today, in the shower. it's starting to bother me the way men look at me, as if i'm existing merely for their viewing pleasure, it's disgusting. i've realized lately that i've become very much less concerned with displaying my feelings, for example, if i don't like someone, i can ignore them and i don't care if they notice, or if they know that i don't like them. i never used to do that, i always used to fake it. but now i don't. maybe it's rude, but i'm tired of putting up with things i don't like. i've also noticed that i'm not as open minded as i one was. time is almost up i feel better, but i wonder what i'm going to go do now. i want to lay down somewhere, close my eyes. i feel like cuddling with someone. but my boyfriend won't do it, he'd just want to make out. i don't, i just want someone to hold me. suddenly i feel like crying a little bit. i don't know what's bothering me. a girl sat next to me who looks like jennifer the si instructor. those sessions are helpful.

746,"I am sitting here trying to start writing, but I can't. I have this problem a lot when writing for my english class, because I never do the reading. This year, however I decided that I would try doing the reading assignments, and it has helped me immensley in my classes. However, now that I am doing the reading in my chemistry class, I see no reason to go to class, because my teacher doesn't understand the concept of teaching, so I basically learn nothing. I often wonder if I am too hard on teachers because I want to be one. In my classes, I always seem to evaluate the teacher so I can figure out what to do and what not to do. In high school band, I spent a great amount of time evaluating my band director because I had such a problem with her teaching techniques. I see music education as a field in which you should be a teacher, not a technician. My band director was not a teahcer at all, but only a technician. We never learned a single thing about music, but she was great at teaching kids how to play instuments. My ADD is kind of annoying at times, because I will be trying to concentrate on one thing, and my mind wanders off to another place. I am thinking about this girl in my music theory class who is very good looking. I think I am going to ask her on a date this weekend. I am not sure what I am going to do though, because my father would not let me take my car to school. Sometimes I think he trys to get out of things by procrastination so he can save money. I mean, he gives me everything I need and most everything I want, but I feel that he is trying to make me think he is going to do one thing, and when the time comes he just finds an excuse to not do it. I have tried, however to start holding him to his commitments. Part of the problem is the fact that he trys to do too much in a 24 hour a day, 7-day a week week. He never pays anyone to repair anything for him. He does it all. cars, house, electronics. I am glad, however that I have grown up knowing and learning how to do repairs from such an extremely intellegent man. I'm sure it will come in very handy one day when I have a house and family of my own. In fact, it has made me want to have a house of my own so I can have something to work on of my own. I'm excited in general about my future. I want to be a music educator, teaching orchestra. I love music education and orchestra so much, but I sometimes wish I was getting a piano degree, as it is my first love. I have taken piano most of my life, and I greatly improved this year, mainly in the past 3 months. I sometimes wonder why I smoke cigarettes, as it is a stupid habit. Why would someone willingly put smoke into their bodies. I guess I enjoy it. i don't know. Most of my friends smoke mariajuana, and it doesn't bother me. I, on the other hand, have never done it, and I really have no desire to. My sister was a somewhat heavy weed smoker her first year in college, and she ended up with a GPA of 1. 9. I don't want to get kicked out of UT my first year, and I want to be able to say that is something I have  never done. My father works on top secret programs for the government, and he says that if anyone trying to get a security clearence has a history of drug use, they are automatically disqualified. I might want to someday become an engineer, and I would like to do what my father does. That is one of the main reasons I don't smoke weed--I don't want to screw that chance up for myself ",0
2379,"     I'm already starting to feel stressed out, and I haven't had any tests yet. It's only been two weeks of school so far, and I feel like I have so much to do. I guess it's typical for for an incoming freshman, since it's new and all. I've never felt so busy in my life. Watching TV, my old passion, seems like such a waste of time to me now. If I have spare time, I could actually be checking out Austin, like the duck boat, which our RA told us about. It seems so cool!! A tour bus turning into a boat ?? It's craziness, and a little scary. We supposedly may go as a hall, which I highly doubt because we don't seem to have hall unity or whatever. I guess I had a misconception of how dorm life would be. At this point, I think getting an apartment would have been just fine, other than the fact that I'm way closer to my classes living on campus. Ok so maybe dorms aren't so bad because I don't think I want to wake up like an hour earlier for the whole public transportation fiasco. I really need to figure out the bus routes because I don't know where any of the buses going other than forty acres and far west, which I accidentally got on to during orientation. It was a great detour. Wow, 20 minutes is a long time, I just realized that. I guess I was comparing it to how long it takes me to do everything else, it seemed like nothing. So yea, back to the stressed out business. I've had something to do since the beginning of summer, since I took summer 1 at a community college, then I went to Clinton, Oklahoma to see my baby nephew and help my brother and sister-in-law out with the hotel they own there. I worked and got paid. Good stuff. A few days after I got home from Clinton, I made my way to Austin. My new home in the Kinsolving dormitory with all the other chics. And I think we all know how busy things are around here. I thought Christmas break would be relaxing and chill time, but I was mistaken. For I found out my closest cousin is getting married January 15, the weekend before classes start. This means that for Christmas break, I will be helping out with the wedding, which from experience already I know is very stressful. And my cousin has asked me to do a dance at her wedding, which is an Indian tradition for a younger girl in the family to entertain the guests with a vivid dance. So now I have to pick a song and choregraph a dance and learn it to perfection so I can perform it in front of hundreds of people. Did I mention that I am a nervous person who freaks out easily ?  Oh and by the way, the wedding is in New Mexico, and the reception is in Houston a weekend later, so I have to go back home after a week of being in Austin, followed by who knows how long of being in Albuquerque, New Mexico. My home is in Lufkin, a little town of pop. 35,000 in East Texas, just two hours north of Houston, 3 hours south of Dallas, and four hours east of Austin. Man oh man, this is going to be a hectic year. And to think I thought studying for my classes was my biggest worry. Well maybe I will grow from all these things, in stead of losing my mind. I guess we'll see. Hey, that kind of relates to Psychology huh ?  Maybe I can be a case study, which I read about in the textbook.        ",0
1788,"     I am a little worried about this asignment because I don't type very fast, but I guess this is giving me good practice. I don't know if i should go run before dinner or take the excerisese class that is after dinner. I need to do something because I will get into the pattern of not working out,and then i will gain the freshman 15 like very one says you do. There is just so many other things that i need to be doing. But i know that i feel better if i work out. If i gain weight i will get depresed and i won't want to do anything. I can't believe Jason is so wraped up in working out. i am supposed to be the one worried about my figure. Ana has lost weigh too. How does she stay so motivated, and excited about runing. I would go take that class, but i have never done kick boxing, and i will problay look very stuiped. There are girls that just never shut up in this dorm. And some that always have the perfect hair and make up. That just seems so high school to me. I am excited about the chrisitan soriety. I hope i can find some girls that i like to hang around with. Surley their will be a couple that i will enjoy being around. I hope I enjoy the pledge retreat on Friday. I bet we will be up all night. That means that I will probably be sick again. Ana is coming down on Saterday, and I hope that Amy will come to. Amy has grown up so much in the last couple of months. I can't believe that she is being exposed to all of the Jenkins trama with Jims affairs. That is just a burden that she should not have to have. I know i think about it all the time and i did not have to listen to it as much as she did. It just amazes me how he could have done that. I wonder if he has some kind of mental problem. It would not surprise me, look at his dad. I just hope Graham is not like his dad. Surley Ana would know if he was. At least i hope she would know, for her sake. I think it is funny how Pam all the sudden likes to cook now. She is in her late fortys and is just now learning how to cook. Thats sad. I am glad that i grew up in a family who cooks, and eats dinner together at night. Or at least we did when we  were little. Not all the time now that everyones off to college. It was so wird going home this weekend, it was almost like i had to get used to it again. It has felt so far away for the past three weeks. I don't want to go home too much. I want mom and dad to get the feeling that Im gone, and so then when i come home it is special. Jason made me mad this weedend, becuause he did not come and visit with my parents. I took time out of my schedule to come and visit his parents. His parents seemed weird this weekend also, i wonder what was up. Page seemed like she was jelouse that they were having to buy Jason some new cloths. That is so rediculous. She is a grown woman that can act like a small child some times. She can be very stingy. I can't believe that Jasons parents don't support him very much, i guess i am just used to having the best dad in the world  ",0
1334,"It's crazy to think here I am in a different city, a new room with new things everywhere. I am now a college student. During high school I couldn't wait for it and now that I'm here I feel out of place. Sure, I know plenty of people from high school along with a list of people whose names I no longer remember, and I stay busy doing all sorts of things, but it is not what I expected. The classes are so big, but is that not what you hear about every school, especially UT. I have not had the success I had I hoped to in meeting people, being the sociable person that I am, I expected it to come easier. I tell myself to give it more time, develop a routine, and things will get better. Everyone says get involved and you will meet more people. It makes me wonder if I should have rushed, though I do not see myself as a sorority girl. It seems as though everyone who pledged a sorority or fraternity is having such a great time. Are they really paying for friendships? I do not think I would have fit in to such a place. I just hope that by going to church groups and other small organizations that I will meet some people with whom I really enjoy hanging with. I am looking forward to my freshmen seminar that begins next Monday. With 30 people in the class, I know I will get to know some of the other students. I never thought I would admit to being homesick, but it is true. Though no one wants to admit it, we all miss home a little bit. However, when we are there we tend to hate it. Isn't it funny how that works? I have also decided that Austin is a city full of beautiful people. Everywhere I look, goodlooking boys and girls. It definitely has both disadvantages and advantages. I enjoy looking at the guys, yet there is so much competition at parties. Should I really care all that much what people at a frat party think of me? Well, I do and it definitely does not do much for one's selfesteem. I believe I am finding competition in everything. Whether it's who was at the gym longer, who studied the most, who had a better meal at dinner, who drank the most last night, or who's going to more parties, there is a definite sense of competition in everything between the people I know. The people I went to high school with. The people whom I now want to separate myself from. Another thing I have noticed is how sleepy I always am. Here I am at 12:22 writing this when I am insanely tired. But why go to sleep, when I do not have a class until 2 tomorrow. There are also a lot of sick people around. The allergies are much worse here than almost anywhere I have been. I have had a cough and a cold since I've been here. It seems like I have so many problems, but I know that there are many people who would die to be in shoes. That is a good feeling, to be in a place where others want to be. I know I need to give things time and make the best of what I have. ",1
1450,"Its hard to think about what to write of when you are told to, although maybe its hard because things have become more difficult as of late. It must be the typical freshman story but even though we all try to be so different when we come here we all end up in the same boat. It so much like high school its hard to believe, we'll the social part of it is anyway. Sometimes I wonder what I would do if there weren't music in the world. At times it seems to be the only thing that keeps people together, although you never hear many people talk about it in that light. What is even more interesting is how depressing and sentimental most of these essays will be. I wonder how many people will write about how depressed they are and how no one really knows the real them and how hard it is to wake up in the morning. Its hard to differentiate between what is real and what is a line out of a movie that someone is saying these days. So maybe that's why everyone tries to be different. I really don't know. But as everyday passes it seems like people lose a sense of the beauty in the world. There isn't anything much more beautiful to me than the sunset or just sitting outside. I find shadows especially beautiful, I'm sure that it holds some underlying meaning to it that I find shadows pretty. Something about how since I like them that I feel that I'm in the shadows of life, but maybe I am. I just feel more alive sometimes when I sit outside in absolute stillness and let everything live around me. I feel as if I'm living with it. Strange I know, but true. I have always felt that if I were to die I would like to die lying in a field in the afternoon listening to music. I have a picture by Monet that reminds me of a field that was behind my house when I was younger. It seems that those times were so much better than times are now. I wonder if I'll ever be as happy as I was back then again someday. And I'm not alone in that thought. Responsibilities just keep piling up day by day and I just wish that there were a break. It would be nice to be a rock star someday, I feel that if I were up there on stage that I would be so much happier. But I know that I probably would feel the same as I do now. I need to do something that will get me recognized someday, I feel as if I'm destined for fame somehow. But as it is now I feel like I'll end up in a dead end life like most others. I know that most say that there are many other things that make life worth living even though they have a job that they hate. But I would rather be a bum then have a job that I hated. I would feel like I sold myself out in someway. Transcendence is something that has always interested me. Mostly the idea that I could transcend life and become something greater than it. The way the words come off ones tongue when they say that makes me feel warm. I envy authors that have a mastery of language. It would be awesome to write something that when people read it they would be overcome with emotions. Hopefully I'll make enough money in my life that I can stop working and spend all my time making music. I just wish I had the balls to become a musician and do what I want, but if I do I feel like I'll be a failure to all those that I've told that I'm going to be a doctor and what not. Its a nice business its just that there isn't much recognition in it unless you put your whole life in it. And I don't think that I could put my whole life into it since I don't think I would enjoy it. ",0
2093,"Music is great. Someday by Nickelback has got to be one of the best songs I've heard in long time. nothings wrong. just as long as you know someday. "" Ahhh well, good message behind it I guess. Every time I look in your eyes    I simply fall into your lies. It's fun to try to make up new lyrics to songs. Helps the creative process I get. I just ate some flavored ice and it tastes pretty good. although the grape had a strange aftertaste. Nothing else could affect me like this. Just your eyes and your deadly kiss. Words just keep popping into my head. I've been listening to this song over and over. Its actually on repeat. My plug only has one socket. I was surprised when I first saw that. Most have two. Oh well. Finally, you've returned my mind to me. But still you've left me nothing. So it's only been 5 minutes and I've written quite a bit. this is slow going. I guess water really doesn't boil if you watch it. People don't seem to call me much anymore. I guess it might be because I end up calling them but still. I don't know, it's weird I guess. This is a lot like writing a journal. free consciousness. I loved Catcher in the Rye. strange book though. I didn't like the other big stream of consciousness book. I forgot what it was called. All I see are visions of your face    Reminding me all of this was a waste. Hmmmm. my time thing doesn't show me how long I have left. I guess I started at 9:40 so I have 10 minutes left. ""Why weren't we able. "" Nickelback really has some great songs. No One, Leader of Men. All seem fairly angry however. Perhaps that is why I liked them. Subconscious anger perhaps?        All you left were remnants of pain    Tell me what you thought you'd gain. My nose hurts. I should put my ring on. For some reason I always forget to put my ring on before going to class. I dropped my 427 Calc class today and opted for 408D instead. I thought perhaps learning second semester was more important than skipping to a higher level of math. It's all about the basics, isn't it? The only bad thing about this was that I also had to drop my philosophy class as well. so I'm down to 13 credit hours. This means I have to find something else to do. Even though I'm working, I kinda feel like I'm being lazy if I don't go back up to at least 15 credit hours. I'm only 1 credit hour above the requirement for a full-time student. Perhaps I'll take Tae Kwon Do or guitar. I think the Tae Kwon Do is only 1 credit hour tho, while guitar is 2. I hope I'll still be able to  start. That'd be pretty fun. The only thing is I don't really know what kind of exams I would get through those classes. Perhaps I'll talk to the music department tomorrow. I have to wake up at 7 tomorrow. I don't really feel like going to class at 8 in the morning. and my calc class still has it's discussions at the same time as before. so I still won't get a break until 4:30 tomorrow. Man, it's going to be a very long day. perhaps it won't be too bad though. Maybe I'll be able to figure out some way to pass the time. This has got to be more than 100 words. All I see right now is the finish button. It's calling me. slowly, slowly. ""instead of a hollywood horror. "" I also see the Logitech sign for my mouse. It's a really good mouse. Nice and cordless, as well as wireless. "". I know you're wondering when. "" So why do human beings miss such obvious signs pointing out problems? Do we really miss them or are we just blinding ourselves to them. Perhaps those are the same things. All you gave me were endless problems. Now show me how to solve them. I really like using the . , ellipses? Something like that. I always got it messed up. I probably overuse them. They're nice though. they show a pause much more clearly than a comma (in my mind at least). Also, they're useful in showing sarcasm. much sarcasm. "". now the story's played out like this. "" ""Nothing's wrong. "" Those just seem to stick in my head. I don't know for sure why. Perhaps I see my own relationships in those. I think it's almost been 20 minutes. I guess I should probably write for a little bit more just to make sure its been a full 20 minutes. ",0
2183,"Well, first I'm thinking about what to write about because this is probably the weirdest writing assignment I have ever been given. I'd like to write about my boyfriend, whom I'm very in love with, but I really do not think that that would be appropriate for this writing assignment. My roommate just left to go to her pledge party, and I really wish I was hanging out with her rather than doing this assignment about a week and half before it is due, but I guess it is better to do it now than to wait till last minute. Which is what I am going to try to do in all my classes, not wait until last minute to do all the stuff that I have to do!  I think that if I can just do that then I will be able to keep with all of my work and get grades in my classes that I will approve. I also need to get into the college of communications so therefore I HAVE to keep my grades up. I really can't wait to become a speech pathologist, I'm very excited about that. Also, God willing I really do think it would be awesome to go to the University of Iowa for their graduate program in speech pathology. They have the best in the nation, and plus ryan goes there. and if I'm going to marry him then being in the same place as him would be a huge plus!  Ok, dee you are completely wondering around here and I'm sure whoever reads this is going think that I am a weirdo, but I really don't have much else to talk about. Hmmm. I am excited about going home this weekend and seeing not only my parents and brother but the rest of my entire family!  I think we will have a lot of fun and I'm excited that I get to leave tomorrow to go home and don't have to wait until friday. I'm having loss of words at the moment. And someone just imed me. uhh oh, have to tell him to hold on!  Ok I did. lets get back on track here. I'M curious as to who gets to read these because I bet that would be a lot of fun. I'm sure that there are LOTS of different things said on each persons assignment. Gosh only 8 minutes of typing! Is this ever going to end!  (hey I'm being honesty here!)  I bet other people are making this a lot more amusing than I am, but I really am typing my thoughts and feelings. Actually I'm typing the first thing that pops into my head, which is probably why this is making NO sense at all. I think that sitting here and typing out what I'm thinking is distracting me from thinking about what I would really be thinking about, because I'm trying to find something to think about that I can type about. Wow that was a confusing sentence. I'm surprised at how much fun I'm having here. I honestly thought that I would become homesick and miss everything back home and I also thought I would miss ryan a lot more than I am. I mean I do miss him, yes!  But there is just so many new things here and everything is so different than usual that my mind is constantly busy thinking about other things. Not complaining because I'm glad I'm not sitting around moping about him, I need to enjoy life, especially college life!  I really can't wait to live in a condo next year and get out of this dorm full of nothing but girls. The girls are nice but being around too many girls all the time can really get to you, but I'm sure if I was a guy I probably would not mind. Sitting here wondering what I'm going to type next. I'm not supposed to be planning anything out, which I'm not, but sometimes I just don't think about anything. I don't always have to have something on my mind do I?  Much less a feeling"". feelings are sometimes so over-rated. Simply type continuously, tracking your thoughts and feelings for the entire 20 minutes. Well I just re-read the instructions and it said to type my thoughts and thinking about what the instructions say is a thought, so I had to type it. Ok 5 more minutes to go, I'm almost there!  Gee I didn't realize how often I just don't think about stuff, but I usually do think a lot about different things, I guess just not now. I consider myself to be a pretty deep thinker, and have more mature thoughts than other people that I know. Take for instance the girls yelling outside my dorm ""yeah theta!"". very loud, annoying, and obnoxious. Yes these are the people I am living with, sweet girls but nothing like me. I don't get into all the sorority stuff. Times running out. whoo hoo!  Now I can get back to talking to the guy who imed me earlier during the middle of this wonderful assignment. which is, I must say the easiest graded assignment I have ever done!  So I think all the rest of the writing assignments should be like this. Good idea huh?  Now I can think about is how I want this to end. I have about a minute to go. So I will take this minute to say hello to whomever is reading this and I hope that you had fun reading my thoughts and ""feelings"" for 20 minutes of my life. Sorry if I bored you, which I probably did. but its ok, I'm really not a boring person!  Well have a good day and goodbye!  ",0
1750,"     My roommate is throwing gummy bears at me. My favorite flavor is the pineapple ones. My roommate is rambling. Pineapples make me think of he beach. The Bahamas. White sand, clear water. I am thirsty. I don't drink enough water during the day. I hear slaming doors, faint radio tunes threw the walls. My window is huge and the view is of a tree. I hear water flowing. My feet are cold. They are always cold. The enter key keeps getting stuck on the keyboard. I need to grease it I guess. I hate greasy fried foods. Dinner tonight was not to great in Kinsolving. I hear a cell phone ringing. I wish I had more minutes on my cell phone. I see the room phone ringing now. The door just opened. Tulips are my favorite flower. They only grow during certain seasons. I with I had tulips. They don't last as long as roses or carnations. Chi O's flower is a carnation. Carnations are funeral flowers. Why does it always rain at funerals. I haven't been to a funeral in several years. I can't spell. The shift key keeps getting stuck too. I hope I get to be on the Diamonds. I need to apply. I miss Cody. He is coming soon. I hope he gets here early. I wonder how Kristin did on her interview. I am sure she was fantastic. I hope she liked Houston better. I hear cars outside. My feet are freezing. I have socks on. my socks are dirty. There are grammer mistakes in this writing. I hope I get to go to church Sunday. I miss my old church. I need to pray more. Man Im glad we are still friends. The game is going to be fun. Do i need to get there early. I wonder where my cousin lives. I wonder what he would have cooked for us. What ever it was, I'm sure it would have been better than what I ate. I can't believe he called me. When will I go home. When will I find a place i like to study. When will this place feel homey. I need to cut my nails. It is hard to type. I need a pedicure too. Ther're my favorite. I like the chairs you sit in. They put me to sleep. I never know how much to tip the woman that works on my nails. My back doesn't hurt. I can't believe it. This chair is hard. I liked stud    ",0
973,"Right now I am sitting at home checking my email and different things. A lot of things are running through my head. I need to read for my classes, I need to go to work, and I need to clean the house. I am interested in this psychology class and I like Dr. Pennebaker a lot. He is funny and keeps class interesting. I look forward to class and believe that I will learn a lot. My sensations at the moment include being extremely tired. I am worried about getting everything done and think that I have to much to do. I am very happy it is the weekend and am so glad I don't have class on Friday and this weekend on Monday. I am excited about this weekend because my small town is having a picnic and they are always a lot of fun. I am sorry that I will miss the UT football game against Stanford but the last one I went to was extremely hot and I was drenched with sweat. I had a lot of fun in spite of the heat though. I love the spirit of the fans and feel proud that I attend a university with so much pride and support. I love to be amidst the fans and hear the roar of the games in general. I saw so many burnt orange shirts in the stands that I couldn't believe it. It is almost solid burnt orange with an occassional white or some other color shirt. I don't need to buy any more UT clothing, etc. I have to much stuff already, but every time I go into the bookstore I buy something with UT on it. I feel sorry for whoever has to read this or check it over because it is boring and I don't even know if I am doing this right. I am just writing what I am thinking and it is turning out to be a cool assignment. I think it has been about twenty minutes so I am going to end the assignment. I enjoyed this and it helped me to write these things out. It felt like I was talking to someone who was a very good listener, even though it was a computer screen and  no one will probably read it anyway.   ",1
1165,"It is 9:35 and I am beginning my stream of consciousness writing assignment. I have been at The University of Texas for exactly one week today. The first night I got here was probably the most alone I have ever felt. My roommate is my best friend from the town where I came from, Pearland. My other best friend was visiting us also. I'm not sure why I felt that way, I was surrounded by two of the people I feel most comfortable around. I'm sure it had to do with being in a different town, sleeping in a different bed, etc. I'm sure I'll learn all about that in this class. I didn't realize I would miss my parents as much as I miss them. I'm an only child and I never really considered myself that close to them. Actually, I am very close to my mom about certain things. As I've gotten older sometimes she just feels like one of my friends. At any rate I really miss them. They didn't call that whole weekend, and I realize it was because my mom didn't want to bother me, but it kind of hurt my feelings. So, I called them. This is really going to help out my typing I can tell it's getting faster. It's 9:46 now. I think when I get through with this I'm going to go to my other friends from Pearland's room and watch a movie or something. It's so easy to not mean new people when you already have friends. There's about 25 people from my home town here. I've met new people in my classes and everything, but these are the people I spend all of my time with. We'll see what happens in the future. Before I left Pearland I had been dating a guy who's going to Sam Houston. We weren't that serious, but now I miss him a lot. We were talking about what we were going to do and I had just assumed we would break up because we would be far away but he didn't see it like that. He had like a list of reasons we should or shouldn't stay together. At any rate, I told him I had to experience new things in college, blah, blah, blah, and we basically decided to break up. It's 9:54 but I'll keep writing a little more. I liked this guy on and off for like a year. Well, now I really kind of regret not staying together because I miss him. He came down to Pearland the Wednesday before I left and we hung out. I called him a couple days ago and he didn't sound very happy to hear from me. Okay, well now I'm rambling, I guess now I'm going to have to move on. Oh well we'll see what happens. It's 10:00. This was kind of fun. ",0
344,"My roommate is trying to ask me what we are going to do while I'm typing this. We played basketball for about two and a half hours. For some reason I played pretty good today, I usually don't play that good. I'm not really sure what to write, well I mean type. I went to a sorority date dash last night. It was pretty fun. They rented out some club on sixth street. I saw some people that I went to highschool with, and I didn't get home until about three so I'm really tired . I really doubt that I'll stay out that late tonight. Tomorrow I'm going to san Antonio for the beastie boys concert with these girls that I don't really know that well. I hope everyone has a good time. The next day is my grandpa's birthday and my entire family is going to meet at our ranch in Gonzales. That reminds me I have to get him a gift. I'll get him something from ut of course probably a hat or something. My suitemates went home this weekend, one lives in Arlington the other lives in deer Park. they are pretty cool guys. Sometimes they get on my nerves but I'm sure I get on people's nerves too. My roommate is going to a church thing right now. He said that the people there are really nice but they are extremist about how they worship, I think it makes him feel uncomfortable, I can relate I've been to some church functions like that. But he is also going because he met some girl there so he is getting the best of both worlds learning about god and hooking up with a girl. I WISH I COULD OF GONE. I can hear my neighbors radio through my wall incase you wanted to know. It kind of makes me want to turn mine on since my time with you is up. ",1
556,"I have so many things to do and not enough time. I feel like I am taking on too much. I know I can handle it if I get past these first few weeks, but right now I feel overwhlemed. I am stressed out with all the reading I have to do. I am such a slow reader and it takes so much effort for me to concentrate and take notes. I know though that I am a good notetaker and if I take the time I should do well in my classes. I am just too tired and stressed right now. I wish I could be at home where no one would come in to bug me or try to use my things and my computer. I am so frustrated with my roommates using my computer. It is new and I am worried they will mess something up. If I make it through till next Tuesday I will be ok. This weekend will be fun though so I just need to relax for once and enjoy it. I miss my family when I get stressed out like this. I keep telling myself""If I can only make it till December. "" It is not that I dislike UT. I like my schedule and my professors, but it is just so different. I know this will be one of my hardest semesters, so with God's help, I will make it through just fine. I just need to relax and enjoy it. I am so determined to make a very good GPA this semseter that I hope I am not dissapointed. The scholarship requirements are good because it gives me a reason to work for them. Actually, I think it scares me more than it helps. I want to make good grades for myself. The scholarship makes me afraid of failure. I am such aperfectionist that I hate failure. I am determined to make a good GPA within my 15 hours. I want to prove everyone wrong who tells me I should have taken 12. If I took 12 I would be in summer school forever. I know I can handle it because I did so much in high school that I am prepared forit. I also don't care if people make fun of me for studying too much. It will payoff when they do bad this semester. I think I just need a break. I am caught up in my reading, but I need a week without 10 different activities for me to do. I just have to have confidence in myself that I can do it and things will get easier as the semester goes on. I felt so good though last night when I got 2 dates. Maybe I will meet some great guy while up here. I was beginning to have my doubts. I am excited about football season beginning. It should be fun to see all the college games. I love college football. I hope we do well this year. I feel like I am running out of things to babble about. Or that all I have done it repeat myself over and over. I guess it doesn't matter as long as I write what I am feeling. All I  hope is that I get everything finished early so that I can go to sleep early tonight. I think I will be able to do that. Well, maybe tomarrow will be a better day. I can't wait till there is nothing going on that I have to go out for. I am sure next week will be better. ",1
1382,"I don't like IceBreaker's gum because the flavor crystals sometimes don't break down in your mouth, and the texture is just plain disturbing. I won a huge pack of IceBreaker's gum from Pro Grad and I now feel obligated to make use of it even though I dislike it. I do that a lot. I eat foods that I don't really like just to make my mom happy. It is not really a big deal. I usually tell people what I like and what I dislike, but sometimes I don't. My grandma uses coconut in her sweets, and I don't like coconut, but I use to eat it anyway. One day I just stopped and she didn't really notice. I was like, ""Man I could have stopped a long time ago, but instead I didn't. "" Okay that makes no sense, but I do not always make sense. My mind jumps from thing to thing, and I digress a lot. I get off track often. Love is a funny thing; it is so hard to really say what it is. To me love is about small things that people don't really notice, but those in love do. I cannot really give an example; but then again that could be because my mind is not really focused on this topic. I can get deep and all emotional when I feel the moment calls for it, but right now I am just not really in a ""deep"" mood. I still have to read my Chemistry and read my Cyberreader for my Cyberpunk class. Why am I taking a Cyberpunk class? I have no idea. I like to try and experience new things so I decided to take it. Actually, it was the only one that fit into my schedule and had a writing component that accompanied it. Ummm eleven more minutes to go. what to say. I love to be happy. I hate to be sick. I love to go swimming or to stay in the shower for really long periods of time when I am sick. The water just seems to clear up and free my nasal passages. I don't want to do my reading assignments. I want to just go for a walk or go out with my boyfriend. I want to go see ""The Cell"" with Jennifer Lopez and Vince Vaughn. I can be such a teenager sometimes. I do some of the most immature and silly things. I can fall all over myself when I see a cute boy band, and I can gush over how wonderful it would be to be a superstar and have a superstar boyfriend. Clay Walker, a country singer, has a song called ""Ordinary People"". It is about how ordinary people have extraordinary love. It talks about how when superstars breakup, and how when they do breakup up that they probably wish they could be ordinary. The great thing about not being a superstar is having your privacy. I can't imagine being photographed all the time. I don't look good in photos when I am posing, so you can only imagine how awful I would look in ones where I do not pose. I sit here writing this and try to think of what you all will think when you read it. You all will see the section about me not liking to be photos and then draw from that that I have selfconfidence issues. I can sit on a dorm chair and swing my feet. I like being short. I like that people view me as cute just because I am short. Being short is good if you are a girl because it would suck it your crush was shorter than you. I just like the idea of the guy being tall. My boyfriend is six feet tall, and that makes us look cuter because I look so cute and little next to him, and for some reason I think that makes us look cuter. Why do they call the prestage room the green room? The green room is often not even green. I don't understand that. I don't understand a lot of things like why the sky is blue, and why the grass is green. Except of course for in way west Texas where there is no grass and if there is it is yellow and tan. I hate people who are hypocrites. I think that you should stand up for what you believe in, and if you don't know what to believe in then don't stand up on your soapbox going in circles. I wish I was smarter. I wish I could sing. that would be a great talent just because I like to sing. Two minutes to go! I can't help but look at the clock. I am the type of person who has to thumb through the pages of my reading assignment and see how many more pages I have to read. I am very impatient, but I am patient when I feel it is necessary. Times Out! The End! ",1

680,While sitting on my computer many thougts and feelings come into my head. I have now been at school for alsmost 3 weeks and I can't believe it. School is finally becoming a reality. It has just started to feel like home. I am from out of state and when I came to school I felt like I was at sleep a way camp trying to meet my friends for the next month. It is true I am not at camp anymore. It has been hard for me lately because I miss home. I miss my family and friends. It seemed to me at the beginning of school that everyone new each and I was the outcast. It has been hard finding friends even though everyone is very nice. It is different here because my closest friends aren't here with me. I came from a very close group of friends and we each went different directions. I am ready to meet new people but I want them to be like my best friends at home and that is not gooing to happen. I have to understand that I will become close to the people here at school I just have to give it time. I also miss my family tremendusly. I am very close to my family and try to talk to them at least once a day but talking is not the same a seeing them. It is very wierd not seeing my sister. We are 3 years apart but we are extremly close. Every time I talk to her I get a tear in my eye. The thought of not seeing her for another month makes me very upset. She told me the other day that she felt like I was on a trip and coming home. She tells me all the time how much she misses me and that makes the situation worse. I can't wait to see her and my parents. I have a very unique realationship with my parents. They are also like my best friends. I feel I can tell them anything. The are my inspiratin and my confindence in one. I have had a lot on my ming latly about school I am very nervous about all the work and tests. I feel as though it is going to be a lot harder that high school. It has been very hard to get back into the school mode but I am starting to get back in to it. I have had a lot of distractions latly with the sorority and and tring to meet eveyone to make friends but I realize I have to start putting school in front of all that. I am here for school and I need to start putting effort in to it. I am very dilgent and like to get my work done but I don't want to stress myself out. Even though school is very important I still need to have fun. I need to balence myself. I feel that it might take some time to get adjusted but it will all work out. School has definately been tough but it has resently gotten better and I know it will get better each day I am here. I am so glad that I made the decision to come to UT and experience this great school.       ,1
2244,"I can't believe that I missed my first class this morning. I don't know what happened. Maybe my roommate turned off my alarm early and didn't tell me. But I don't think so, because he's a good guy and he wouldn't do that. I hope there wasn't a quiz in kinesiology today. That would just be my luck. The one time I miss it, there was a quiz. Man this sucks not having books, I'm getting so far behind in all my classes reading. It's going to be hard to catch up. There are some many people in all my classes it's ridiculous. You know what else is ridiculous, not having books. Why can't I get into shape faster?  I know it takes time, but I've been running for 3 weeks and I don't see  much of an improvement. If I am going to walk on the cross country team here I need to be faster than I was in high school. My old high school team mates are not doing so hot right now. The top runners are running about one minute and a half behind what we were running last year. I was running 16:26 for a 5K, but these guys are running like 17:40 for a 5K. They are going to have a lot of time to make up if they are going to be competitive in one of the toughest districts in the state, second to only the woodlands district. God, I hate the woodlands, and cedar park, and Georgetown. I wish I hadn't injured myself during track season, cause I had to take 3 months off the heal. And three months with no running killed me. I gained like 20 pounds during the summer session here at UT. But summer school was so much fun. I met lots of cool guys like Kevin, rahim, and Justin. And a lot of girls. Actually too many girls to count, but out of all those girls, I don't think any of them found me attractive at all. And when ever some girl approaches me at a party, some one will swoop in take her. Some one like Kevin or rahim. I'm still mad for what Kevin did. I can't believe that he ""made out"" with my best friend and the girl that I love so much. That just sucked. I felt like some one had ripped out my heart and then run it over with several big rigs, then dropped it off a high building, then feed it to piranhas in the Amazon rain forest. But I know Kevin didn't do that one purpose, or did he?  But I had a long talk with both Heather and Kevin, and we're cool. Oh and Heather is coming to visit this weekend!  I am so excited! I haven't seen her since before school started like 4 weeks ago. I'm disappointed because she was supposed to come to UT but she didn't get into articture school so she had to go to atm, but she is going to transfer her in a year. I hope. I have to plan a fun weekend with stuff for us to do, so she and I can have a good time again. But what do I do?  I have to work part of sat and sun, but we still can have fun Friday and then after I get off work. I just want her to be happy, if its not with me then so be it. But I will marry her, I will marry her, because I love her so much and she is my best friend. I hope she feels the same way. I don't know what to do, cause I don't want to mess up our perfect friendship, oh well. We will have to see what unfolds. ",1
927,"Today, what am I feeling. actually my roommate and I were talking about how we werer homesick. not in a bad way. we just miss home. I wish I knew what it was about home that I miss. is it the people? no not really considering I didn't have any really good friends when I left home. it it my parents? yeah some of it is that. but there's just this emptiness and I can't figure it out. I also feel like I am in a hella bad mood. it could be pms but it think it is a little too early. I really really hate pms. I get totally irritable and I was noticing yesterday how I felt really annoyed with people. especially my roomate and another friend. I figured it was just cause I was tired and sick of people in general but now I think maybe it is something more. well the stress of school finally begins. I'm remembering how much I hate stress. this stress is alittle different because its mixed with a lot of anxiety. I am a very anxious person at times and I hate it. I get very freaked out when I don't know what is going to happen. I guess you could say I have a big fear of the unknown. when I was applying to high school I used to freak out a lot and have crying fits because I didn't know where I was going to school. then this spring I would have freak out attacks about where I would live. I hate not knowing what will happen in the future. I think its kinda funny that I am a christian yet I struggle with the unknown. part of being a christian is having faith in god to work out all the things he has for you. but I find it really hard to trust in god and just let the fear go. I guess I have my weak areas just like all christians. anyways anxiety, I am really anxious about school. I have no idea what to expect as far as tests and grades. I told myself that because I couldnt drink this semester I would try really hard to get good grades. but it is just so hard to make myself sit down and study. I am areally lazy person and I don't like to work very hard if I don't' have to. I'm starting to ahve doubts about my major. I reaaly love spanish but I'm not sure I'm good enough to pursue it as a major. I guess there are just a lot of people in my spanish class who seem to be  so much better that I am at spanish and I get discouraged. anyways, I think my friend graham made a good point when he said that a lot of people didn't place out of spanish hours like I did and that college spanish teaches you a lot morethan high school spanish. I think he was right. but still, I'm just not real sure any more. ugh the people next door play their music so loud. it really is rude. I wonder if we play our music too loud nad jus tdon;t realize it. hmmmm. well time feels like its going by really slowly. perhaps my bad mood is jus t the devil trying to take away from the awesome things god did this weekend. well that's a thought. that retreat kicked some booty!!!!!!

570,My dad and I are trying to reconnect our computer and get the internet back on it and he is driving me crazy. He insults my intelligence and thinks I never know what I am talking about. This really makes me upset and hurts my feelings to the point I just feel like breaking down into tears. I am also stressed out about school this semester. I am on probation right now because my GPA fell below 2. 0. I am really trying to keep up this semester and bring it up but it is really stressing me out. Sometimes I just feel like giving up on everything but I know that will not solve anything. My life just feels so empty right now. To start off with I get in a bad car accident a few months before I graduate high school and then get a really crappy job for the summer. Then I end up on probation at the end of my first year at UT and I still have the same crappy job for the summer. Then I also have to take a summer course at ACC along with my crappy job. Then I have to have surgery which put me out of commission for half of the summer. The next thing I know my boyfriend and I are separating after a year and a half. Now I am back at UT struggling to keep up and improve my grades. My life just seems to be going down the drain right now and I seem to be following close behind. Though I enjoy my classes this semester I feel I am going to fall behind and I will end up need major help to get through it all. I just wish I had enough motivation to follow through with my studies and just blow everyone out of the water with my grades this semester. I wish now that I hadn't put this assignment off so long because now I have to be all the way out here on campus instead of at home studying. You know if I don't get off probation I am afraid my parents or the school will take me out and I will end up at ACC permanently. Getting a degree from ACC is not the best thing in the world you know. It is almost like getting a GED from high school because you had to go to ATLAS or something to that effect. ,0
352,"I wonder if I am doing this right. I can't stop thinking about truyen. I need to stop. Jesus, she is like two hundred miles away and I can't get her out of my mind. I need money. I need something. maybe a drink. maybe I need a cigarette. I was trying to quit but I just can't seem to do it. its only been two minutes now and I have already run the course of my brain.

I think my hypothalamus is screwed up. shit my bag is in my way, It's on fire AAAHHHHHHH I can't breathe. I keep pushing that damn backspace button.

I 'm talking about a backspace button and what 's really on my mind is the fact that I have no money and I am lonely. Maybe I shouldn't be writing this, but oh well. I don't care who reads this. You only know that I am a number. Maybe if you got to know me I would scare the living shit out of you. I am screwed in the brain. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaA I have like fifteen more minutes and my arms are getting sore. I need to stop, but I can't' stop! I need to press on with my story of nonsensical blabbering. I want to go home. I need a job. I need a woman. I have a woman but she is in Dallas and I am in Austin. Am I forcing myself to think this? Am I just doing this for the show. No I really am hungry.

91,"Wow, I'm pretty tired right now it's been a heck of a weekend. staying up for Diana's funeral was pointless, but nevertheless interesting. I wonder if I'll have that kind of burial when I die. I think my grandfather  should at least had a funeral twice that size. he was the second greatest man to ever walk on this earth besides Jesus Christ himself. I'm listening to the live dcTalk album right now and it rocks. There is no group of celebrities that I admire more than them. Their music has meaning. It isn't just the meaningless stuff about drugs, shooting somebody up, or scoring with someone. It is stuff that is relevant to our world and to our generation, not to mention it is the best musically sounding stuff out there. I wish more people knew about them. I know they would agree with me. the game this weekend surpassed my expectations. At first I thought it was going to be lame 'cause the crowd was soo dead, but as soon as we scored the crowd went wild and the atmosphere from then on was electric. UCLA will be a very tuff game next weekend. My parents are coming up for the game. Surprisingly I don't miss them all that much, although  I do care about them a bunch. Maybe it's just because I'm soo busy with school I really hope that my edp paper is not that hard because I lack the motivation. I really wish my acne would go away. I believe life would be soo much better if it were gone. The confidence and social skills would be so easy and fun. I wouldn't be soo much of a hermit. I hope I can get my hair to grow out to the right length and get it colored they way I want to. I also hope that I can acquire the presence I am seeking as far as my appearance goes. It would really be awesome if we won a national championship this year and Ricky Williams won a Heisman Trophy or even James Brown( by the way I hope he is okay). Richard Walton did a great job backing up and filling in. Gee I hope I make it to class on time and I really hope my future girlfriend is there to ask me out. ",0
1178,"This is my writing I always feel like everything should have a title. Somebody told me I was anal last night. I don't think so though. I've always thought myself to be rather easygoing. Church always made us be nice to people. That's another thing, people always tell me that I'm ""like the nicest person I've ever met!"". I don't see it. I may be easygoing but I do not consider myself nice. I think I'm just not mean so people think I'm nice. I'm not. You should see how I treat the men in my life. The poor boys don't have a clue. Marques hopefully will never find out because I actually do love him a lot but I just can't seem to settle down for anything. That's got to be some kind of mental deficiency don't you think. Oh well, around this campus I think I am one of the only sane people around here. I'm saying that like I think I'm sane. I don't think I am. I like William a lot too. He's so strong and ""Mr. Cool"" like. I'm always attracted to the strong cute ones. I guess it's some kind of complex about my tiny stature that I always go after big men. I can't believe Marques got up to almost 300 pounds this summer. He is really making me mad though because he is not helping my constant state of confusion that I have been dealing with lately. I hate typing. I don't have anything to say anymore. I wish I had a twinkie and a juice box. I do need to go to the grocery store. Eckerds is just up the street though so I'll go up there if I can ever get caught up on all my work. I am going to try to make it to the Delta party tonight. I think everybody's going to be there. I hope William is there. He's such a cutie and he likes me a whole lot. He gave me these two massive hickies on the sides of my neck. They look really bad and they kind of hurt too. Oh well, at least I've found somebody that I like. I wish Marques was here so that I could take my mind off of all these cute men. My nursing class is cool. Are you sure that you wanted us to just type whatever comes to our minds. Well, I don't think you want to get inside my mind. There's a whole lot of stuff that should not be open to the public right now. I guess everybody thinks like this though. I can't call myself different because sometimes I know that I am different. I don't think like everybody else I know. I think I'm a little bit on the crazier side than they like to think I am. Okay, I have been typing for 12 minutes now. I told you that I don't have anything to say. It's not like I don't write in my journal every night. I know how my mind works and I don't particularly like it. I happen to think I'm a little nuts, but who isn't. This isn't all about me though. I'm not the teacher so I guess I just have to sit here and type until your hearts content. That's what I'm here for. My mom tries to make people happy too much. She had to go to a craziness doctor a few years ago because she almost had a nervous breakdown. I thought it was funny though so maybe that's mean of me but if you knew my mother you would think it was funny too. She's not a very nice lady and she bothers me way too much. I wish she would stop calling and acting like that good little mother that she always want to be. She's not. I love my daddy. He called while William was still in the bed this morning. Not good. He kept tickling me and my dad was kind of getting suspicious but William plays too much anyway. I need to go take a nap and it's been more that twenty minutes so I'll talk to you later. ",1
2077,"Ok well I have been putting this off for a while, but now I'm sitting down to do it. Just to let you know I'm really bad with punctuation and spelling and capitalization when I'm typing on the computer. its good in word because it corrects your spelling and capitals and grammar for you, friends is on the tv in the background right now, that show has been on for a long time. I'm really kinda stressed right now, I feel like I'm really behind in my classes and reading and homework. it would be good to have like a full free day or two. I guess that is what the weekend is, but this weekend I'm going home, my parents are really excited that I'm going. I have to get my acr fixed because I ran into a tire on the road the other day and it screwed up the bumper. I never understood that, who is the guy driving around with no tire? I really really don't understand that. things are a little weird right now, my roomie's going through some rough times and I'm trying to be there for her, I really hope I can be all shse needs. and than my boyfriend is like 600 miles away up in arkansas and I miss him like crazy. I wish he was here sometimes, but it seems like we'll really enjoy the time we have together now that its limited. he is a great guy and I miss him so much. anyways I'm not really sure what to write about now, my classes are ok, but I feel bogged down with work right now, I don't want to feel like I'm complaining about it. I also am a really bad typer. I never took that class in grade school where they teach you the home row and stuff and so I have to look at my fingers a lot. , really, I shouldn't blame it on not having the class, I could have learned on my own, but I didn't, oh well, I'm making it. but I'm not correcting my spelling and typos very much right now, but I notice that as I type my typing is getting better and faster and I have to look less and less at the keys because I'm getting more and more used to it as I sit here. college seems weird to me. so many people, so many changes. my roommate and one of my suitemates are both friends from high school which is awesome, they're great but its been hard for all of us to get out and meet people because ww hang out together a lot so that we don't have to put ourselves in uncomfortable situations and deal with new people. but I talked to some really nice kids today. things are good, I don't know if I should go home or not this weekend but my parents really want to see me and its just a drive to houston which is not very bad so I'm going to go, I'm looking forward to seeing my brother too, he is a freshman this year. soooooooooooooo anyways I don't know what to talk about. seinfeld is on tv now, I really like that show, funny, lighthearted, and you never have to know anything from the previous episode to catch the new one, I really like that because then I don't have to be committed to watching every night. all my books are on my bed right now and this writing assignment is not due for two days but I'm doing it now, even though I have assignments due in the morning, I think I'm just putting those off and instead I'm doing this because it seems a little more enjoyable than doing calculus problems or something like that, or reading, ugh I hate the reading. I'm not a good reader I don't think, I'm horrible at reading comprehension, at least that is what the standardized tests say. but anyways I'm a slow reader, I think, ok only 30 pages. but then 30 pages take me like an hour and 15 minutes. no small ordeal. wow I can't believe I have written this much I'm only 14 minutes, I have no idea what I'm going to write about for 6 more minutes. blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah I wonder what happens if you push the finish button before the time is up, I don't want to try but I bet someone does. someone who just wants to get out of whatever they can. maybe someone will tell me sometime. yay one of my suitemates just came home, she is on the phone, she is really cool. she just asked what I was doing, I tried to tell her and write at the same time, I didn't do very well, my fingers didn't press the right keys, hard to do two things at once, I'm not one of those people who can like talk on the phone and clean or mess with the computer at the same time, I need to focus on talking on the phone or something else. not both, that is probably because I don't want to let the other people think that I'm not paying attention to them, ah I just got distracted for like 10 seconds. yipe. so anyways, well my timing is going down I only have two more minutes left and now I feel like I need a break but I don't have time for breaks, I think I'll make some coffee and stay up late and get stuff done. yay only one more minute. my room is messy right now too. I don't really mind it if its my mess though, oh well, ill clean it up soon, I am soooooo excited that this is almost over! it was a lot harder just to write than I thought. wow ",1
1584,"     I am very excited, but anxious to be in this new city, Austin. It is overwhelming right now solely because I don't know everyone here and am still meeting new friends. I enjoy all my classes but know that this semester will probably be very strenuous. My goal is to work hard and try my best to not get caught up in the social life and to focus on what is most important, my grades. I am feeling a little homesick though, because I am out of my comfort zone and surrounded by all new faces. I miss my family a little, and my boyfriend a lot. I am excited to be here, but feel a little left out sometimes. Everyone knows eachother and I sometimes feel alienated. I am listening to cars floor by my dorm room window. Which causes me to lose concentration at times. It is also hard when the girls here are screaming and running through the halls. Especially at night when they come running in all drunk. I smell flowers all throughout our room because we have received so many from pledging Theta. My roommate and I just got through with Rush and are excited about our new sorority. I know it will give me a chance to branch out and meet new people, which will be nice. I am noticing, though, that most of the girls here are pretty clicky. It is hard to make friends when they are all always going off together in little groups. Im not the type of person who is usually affected by those little things, but being without my boyfriend and my hometown friends makes things a little more difficult. I realize though, being here will teach me how to become a more independent person and that I will have to learn to adjust when things don't always work out the way they seemed too. I love the condition of our room right now also because my roommate is a pretty clean person which makes me a pretty clean person. Our room is all tidy and neat. I know my mom would be happy. I really love this city of Austin. It is so fun and such a party place. It also seems to me to be a bit overwhelming. I'm not all into this every night party life. Don't get me wrong I love to party and all, but to a certain extent. I'm a christian too which makes living here kind of difficult. You become so wrapped up in all the constant parties and b. s. that you sometimes forget who you really are. One thing I want to do while at school here for the next 4 years is discover who I really am. When you take away all the parties and superficialness. what is left? I want to make something of myself in school and in my personal life. I am contemplating on whether I want to go out tonight with the girls or stay in and go to bed early. It seems like im always on the go here, too. There is always something to do and barely ever any time to simply relax. As you can probably tell i am a little stressed out. I notice it is getting more quiet in our dorm now because the girls have all left to go out. My computer just froze for the longest time so for about 5 minutes I couldn't write. So i am going to start again, because for 5 more minutes and finish my time. sorry. anyways, i am really frustrated now because my computer has been having so many problems lately. It is making me very aggravated. So in case you know this I am still typing after the 20 min time period, because 5 of my minutes were taken away because of this stupid computer. Well, I am hoping that I will learn my away around Austin soon because this city is very confusing. I just want to have a notion of where everything is. I hate not knowing my way around places. Well, I am going to end it now because I timed an extra 5 min on my clock and it is up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     j                                                                                                                                                                                              m                        y                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ",0
1359,"My English teacher should go back to her own country. She read my essay today, and she couldn't understand a word on it. My topic is on samesex marriage, but she didn't even know that samesex marriages are illegal in the U. S. She read through the whole thing and asked me, ""So what is your point?"" At first, I thought it was just me, so I took it to the writing center. In a way, I just wanted to talk to someone. I had to complain about her to someone. Anyways, the guy in the writing center agreed with me. It's not my problem that she can't read. Well, I guess it is since she is the one who's going to grade my paper, but I am not going to put up with her. I am so going to change my teacher tomorrow. I am so glad that I still have the chance. I feel really relieved because my rough draft is done. I finally feel like I am getting somewhere with my paper. I am also very excited because the weekend is coming up. I am going to finish my homework in one day and enjoy the rest of my weekend. Maybe I will do my homework for the next week ahead of time so I will have more time during the week. I don't know. I seem to be addicted to homework lately. My dad said that I won't be happy if I move out. Well, I don't think that is true at all. I admit that college life is much harder than I have ever imagined, but living with him doesn't change that a bit. It's not like he could help me with my homework. He never did anyway. I feel so relieved after I moved out. It's great that I only have to deal with school. Dealing with my dad is much harder than anything else. I haven't really talked to my mom for a week now. I don't really know if I should call her. She is so worried about me. In a way, she is giving me a lot of stress. We are always talking about the same thing now. She keeps trying to convince me to move back. There is just no way that I am going do it. ",1
261,"I want to start with a simple color. Let's say blue. When I think of blue I think of the ocean and where I live. I live in Brownsville Texas. It's ""on the border by the sea""  That's like the Brownsville saying. I also think of baby blankets, actually my baby blanket. This leads me to thinking about a George Strait song entitled ""Baby Blue"". It's a song about his daughter that passed away in a car accident. He's describing her eyes and what he thinks about every day. That has to be hard to deal with. A death in the family is such a detrimental thing to cope with. Fortunately my family has never had an immediate family member pass away. The closest I've been to a loved one that has died, was my great-grandmother. I've also had my girlfriend lose her great-grandmother and her grandmother right after each other. I went to those funerals. I really don't like them very much, It's extremely sad for all the loved ones mourning the death. I guess this leads me to thinking about the color black. It's weird that people usually associate things or ideas to color. I guess it's because we're such a vivid creature. Our vision capabilities are quite advanced when compared to those of other animals. We, humans, are able to see most of the spectrum, all we cant see is the ultra-violet end and the, oh I forgot, I think it's the infer red side as well. We might excel in vision, but are still very primitive in the sense of smell. When we compare our smelling to that of canines, all I can say is that they are able to smell around 100-1000 times better than us. Back to black. Jet Black is favorite color, or at least it used to be. I really enjoy viewing the colors of nature. I have found myself buying shirts the colors of nature. Like a dirt/green or pale/orange, light/yellow or sky/blue, the color of soil. I love the smell of the earth after it rains, it smells so pure, rich, I guess I associate that smell to nature. Imagine what a dog smells after it rains. Now that's something I wish I could take a whiff of. That's around 25 min. of writing. I want to say that this has been a great experience for me. It calmed me down from this hurried morning. I feel more at ease with myself, but I can't explain why. Well, I hope you've enjoyed this little talk with me. I know I'm not supposed to use ""you"" when writing a paper, but the instructions say that it's alright to fib a little in my grammar. Sorry for any misunderstandings. ""Good-bye and Good-luck. "" ",1
1420,"Hmmmm. What am I going to write for my stream of consciousness. I don't even know if I spelled that word right. Oh, well. I guess I just write whatever comes into my head. By the way, I have to fill out my daily schedule for my EDP 310 class. Don't forget about that. It's kind of hard to type whatever comes into my head because my hands aren't as fast as my thoughts. (That's obviously a good thing). What's on my mind. This is a lot harder than I thought. Sometimes there is absolutely nothing in my head and I just draw a blank. Nothing to write about. I wish that I can draw pictures on this thing but I can't. I tend to be a more visual person and I get a lot more pictures in my head than words. I think I'm going a bit over twenty minutes, although it doesn't seem like it. I just sit here at my computer and think sometimes because I want something to pop in my head so I can write it down, but nothing happens. It seems like when you want your mind to wander, it has a harder time doing it, but if you're trying to concentrate on something, like when you're taking a test, your mind can't stop wandering. I guess that's the amazing thing about the brain. so unpredictable. At least to the untrained individual who doesn't know what to look for it seems unpredictable. Maybe not so much for an expert. Its funny how the mind works. Anyway, I don't want to get all philosophical or psychological or anything so I think that my time is up. Until next time. Ooohhh my arm itches  ",0
748,"I am tired today. I should have gone to bed earlier. I need to study. How much do I need to read for my classes to get A's in them? I have to do my economics homework today. I miss home I miss my family. I have never been away from home for this long. I won't get to see my parents till parents weekend but that will be really nice. I have a fraternity meeting at 6:30. I can't wait until the next football game, the game this past weekend was awesome. I need to wear a hat at the next game cause I got a bad sunburn last weekend. My face hurts from the sunburn still. I wonder when our next fraternity mixer will be. A picture reminds me of my Europe trip last summer. It was one of the best experiences I have ever had. I have a paranoid feeling that I am not doing enough work or studying, that I am neglecting something. I hate doing laundry, I have already had to do it twice since I've been in Austin. It hasn't rained since I've been here, I wonder when it will rain. I hate the heat and humidity in Austin. I can't wait till it cools down and turns into fall. The girl in my business administration class yesterday was very pretty, maybe I can go on a date with her sometime this semester. Viacom merged with CBS, maybe CBS won't be such a lousy network anymore. I need to eat lunch soon. I hope I am doing this assignment right. I hope I will have time to study tonight, I need colored pencils to finish my economics assignment, maybe my roommate has some. ",0
1713,"     wow i am so tired i really just wish that i could go to sleep. why do they put a philosophy class in the law building i will never know. i can't believe that i just walk for 25 min just to get back to my dorm. i wonder what there is to eat tonight. i hope it is good. the last couple nights the food has been pretty  good. man i really have alot of homework tonight i hope the fraternity doesnt keep me late tonight. it is such a pain to have to walk all the way to the house just for a meeting. wow i am really thirsty. i really want a glass of water. i wonder what everyone is doing right ow. i bet they are still in class. when is that girl going to get down here so we can study for math. i need to go get a map of the bus routs. or a map of where i can park so i don't have to walk anymore. oh man its only been 5 min. i wonder who im going to ask to go to the OU Texas game. i wonder if i will even get tickets to this game. my band isnt very good, i better go try and find someone that has a better band. oh yeah i have to go buy my tops pictures that i took. i need to go get a hair cut. i wonder what i will look like when i can't cut my hair or shave for 6 weeks i bet i will look really funny. man my palm really hurts i wonder what i did to it. maybe it was when i was doing gymnastics tricks for people. i wonder if ut has a gymnastics team or what intails being a cheerleader. i really liked it at that last game when they did all the flips. i really hope that ut wins the national championship this year. that would be so cool to win in swimming and football and baseball all in the same year. i wonder if any other school has done that before. aww im so glad that i am done with classes today i don't know if i would be able to make it if i still had to go out and sit in another class. hey my roomate just brought me mail. wow a letter from my parents how exciting. my roomate keeps talking he doesnt realize i don't care. hahahaha he is talking about his macintosh. and his knew program. wow he has a really low band for the ou game. maybe he can get me a ticket. he is telling me a story about our pledge trainer and how he made a stupid comment. it was actually a good story im surprized. wow i think alot. i wonder when it is going to start to get cold. i don't know if i can take this heat any longer. i really want to go watch the simpsons. wow what a great show. my roomate still is talkign about his computer. i still don't care. my roomate i have decided does not stop talking. wow im almost done this wasnt as bad as i thought it was going to be. i think that stream of conciousness is really ran ",0
940,"I have an aching headache and coughing every five minutes. I can diagnose that I have a cold because of my symptoms. The symptoms plagued me for more than 3 days and will not go away. This is very upsetting because I am planning to go tubing with some friends on sunday. If this sickness is ongoing, I may not go tubing. I'm taking a lot of medicines to relieve myself from this sickness, but nothing is working. My frustration is aiding the sickness to persist. There's one class I'm having problems in. The class is microeconomics; I failed both quizes and so behind in my reading. I'll spend a lot more time studying for that class than any others. I always have something to do but my sickness is preventing me to fulfil it to my best potential. I met a lot of people and made new friends in college; it made me have a sense of belonging that of which I lacked in high school. After me sickness is gone away, I know that I will have a great time and have a sense of directrion in life. My floor is so friendly and nice. We go out together and a maater of fact we went to Olive Garden last Sunday. I joined many societys like the Pre-MEd adn Pre-Dent societies to better my future and put me ahead of others.  ",0
1934,"I think I'm trying to hard to write what I'm thinking which defeats the entire purpose of this paper, you aren't supposed to think about what you write, you're supposed to write what you think about. Wow, I was impressed with that little quote there. I cannot live without you. "" I've had that song stuck in my head all day long. It's a good song but I only know that much of it. I wish I could actually sing the rest of the words to that song instead of mumbling through them. I have a problem with singing lyrics. Why am I reading over what I have just wrote? I guess it's just a habit that I've gotten into after writing so many essays in my life. I usually despise essays. I love writing, just not essays. Hmmm. was that a pretty girl that just walked by? I just caught her foot as she passed my door. I think it was a pretty foot. I need to find a girlfriend. Girlfriends are great. Well, they can be. Depending on who it is. I loved my last girlfriend to death. I miss her so much. I hate not being able to see her any more. Curse age! Of course I do not wish I was 2 years younger but I do wish that she was 2 years older. Why did I bother to redo that sentence? I actually wrote 2 sentences and then combined them to make one. Am I following all of the rules to the ""Stream of Consciousness"" writing assignment?              I wonder if you can determine if a person has ADD by reading a ""Stream of Consciousness"" paper. Hell, by the time you get done with mine, you will probably think I am. Hell, hell, hell, hell, that word just stuck in my head for some reason. I wonder if that means that I'm satanic. ""Thegreatjakobie"" just signed onto AOL instant messenger. ""I can't talk buddy! I'm writing what I think!""          Metacognition. Thinking about thinking. That is such a cool concept. I often think about MEtacognition so I guess I can say that I often think about thinking about thinking. That actually makes sense. ""I cannot live without you!. all that kjsoifl me, alkjsoithaj me, I cannot live without you!"" Damn words. I should probably learn them. I often spell a word that I know how to spell but it doesn't look right when I write it so I spend like 5 minutes trying to determine if it's spelled right. I'm thinking about that damn song again. My elbow hurts. It pops a lot. I wonder if that means it's going to fall off one day. I don't think it's healthy. I don't know anybody else who's elbow hurts and pops on a regular basis. ""Strike 3! You're out!"" I hate baseball, but it popped into my head when I spelled basis. Bases. Stases! Rhetoric and Comp class sucks. It's not my cup of tea. Have you ever been in one of those really big tea cups that spin around really fast at carnivals? They suck too. When I get done I feel like I'm going to vomit all over my shoes. Vomit stinks a bunch. My friend Paxton doesn't like vomit either. He says that when he smells vomit, it makes him want to vomit too. And all the people around him will see all this vomit and pretty soon, the whole room is blowing chunks all over each other. Chain vomiting. Comforting. I'd like to stop thinking about vomiting now. ""I cannot live without you!""        Latin drums can seriously rock! Especially in that damn song that I have had stuck in my damn head all day. My face itches. I hate when things itch. That would be a feeling that I would rather not have. If I had a choice of course. Only 2 minutes left! That sucks! I'm kind of getting into this whole writing thing! We should do this assignment every week! That would rock. oooooooowwwwwwwww! Damnit! I was stretching and when my arms came back down I hit my already broken ass elbow on my chair. That sucked! Oh man, that really depressed me. That hurt a whole bunch. AhhhH! 30 more seconds! Lets see how many letters I can hit! kasdfkjhasdkfjhaksdjhfkljasdhfkljadshfkljadshfkljahdsfkljhasdklfjhaklsdjhklahciluhekjhsdfkljahdsfkljhasfdkljhicukljaeno;iawejoijackjnOWEDJOAUR9238U4R928JOFJIEODFIJA9WE8URFOJKLJSDCVLIUADSHFCKJENRFLKH9PC8USDCIOAJERFKJRIOFJUP98UFOASDFJKJNCKDSJCPOAIUFPO0WUERO9QU8W3ROIQWJREFKNSDOVJOAISDUJVA98WEUF9WUEFROAWKEJRFLKIJSDFOLAIJSDFOIAUJFOIKW4EJFOIJASDOIFJASLDKFJAO;SDIFUJ0WAOEJFLKNVOIJC0932I1-09I-1I-0           hA!

949,"I think this is a really cool writing assignment. I like assignments that are easy yet mean something. I really hate this song I don't know why I am listening to it but I am too lazy to go change the station. and this new keyboard  is hard to type on it forces me to typer 'properly' I guess thats not abad thing. I like it when my roomate is not there sometimes and I am here alone I like being alone. I am currently having a brain blank. I am full because  I just ate lunch with my friends and now the bottom of this hard wook chair is pressing into my ankle bone and is killing me. ouch. I don't understand why my room is so cold good lord ihave to wear long sleeves to stay warm. I am very tired and I should sleep but I need to do this assignement which I have sadly put off already too lonf. haveing an 8am math clas sis not fun and I hate it. but the material is easy so far. I am bored and tired and I feel like going home but I can't my roomate is going home and I will be here alone all weekend. well we are rarely alone becase all of my freinds come to our dumb room all the time which sometime is annoying because we don't get stuff done soemtimes. this new song is itersting. I love music. I am sleepy. but man the lyrics are so dumb. what is the deal with all this insipid lyrics. I don't know what else to wreite. I think amybe my mind is slow because I just ate and I'm sleepy and I can't think very clearly. there really isn't much to think about. I am happy that my friend is coming to visit us here he lives off campus and we don't get to see him too often. but hes really cool. I feel happy to be able to see him. I feel comfortable with him. I really like my room. this commercial is really dumb I wonder if they even make impressions on anyone. I feel bad for putting this assginment off for so long. I don't usually do this I often wonder if  I will pull the 3. 5 I need this semester I hope I do. I think I am overall happy here in austin but I get lonely someimee even tho I am surrounded by my friends. but they are my high school friends. writing for 20 minutes about nothing in particular is harder than it sound si guess. I can't think of anything to write. my mind is blank. all I am thinking baout is typing. which I am not doing very well. I miss my parents! woah what a comment but I think I do. which is cool I guess but it has ony been like 3 weeks I don't know what to think I wonder what football game is next (NFL) I think we are playing the redskins soon. I think tis radio station is terrible. my roomate souild be be back in like 30 mih\nutes. man I dotn have anything to say. I think I maybe should have  done this assignemnet at a later tome when my brain isn't sleepy and my stomach isn't full from lunch. my floor is really dusty. gross. I have 4 minutes left. write weite write. I can't write anything. i am mentally singing the lyrics to this song and that is the only thing in my mind. I am going to try to go to the libraby tomm and study. I have parties to go to tonite and sat nite and an honors 'party' on sunday so I have to try to get as much done on sat. I feel like I am behind. college is hard as to where u will get behind and then wham it all sneaks up on u and u don't even realize it. but I love it so far and I can t imagine living this life for 4 years. thats a long time and I can see why people love these 4 years so much they are so random and fun. I can already tell that I am going to miss it during the summer and when I leave. I have 2 minutes left. I like having my own computer here I brought it over labor day weekend and I set it up, boucht the cables, etc all by myself which I have never doen before but I did it and its a cool sense of accomplishemnt. and I catually got the wthernet working even tho I had heard horror stories about it not working. its so fast. I like being self sufficient I thik its really good. I liked setting it up and makin it work myself. and it aint no I-Mac either where u just plug that mess in. oops times up. ",1
567,"so I'm sitting right here and my roommate and his girlfriend are abut to go out to sixth street. I have no real plans for tonight so I decided to do this assignment instead!  it's been sort of a crazy week. lots of things have been bugging me and you know no ones seems to care about some of the stuff that I'm going through right now and yes I am going through a lot of personal problems but I don't want to write about those because I've talked about them enough this week ok, my roommate and I sort of get along but I'm never really sure how good of friends we really are but who cares I went to see loveline tonight and some people asked some pretty crazy questions people are so afraid of sex in this country I mean really everybody's thinking about it and that's all anyone really cares about I mean sure there is friendship and all that but come on sex is part of it too. how many friendships develop over some kind of sexual relationship or develop because someone needs advice about a sexual relationship? sex sex. it's like the underlying cause of all of our actions (who we make friends with, how we act, dress) and I'm not having much but that's another story. I mean I don't have that much of a sex drive to begin with, I personally think that sex and intelligence are somehow related-cause stupid people are always having it with other stupid people. you never see two brains getting enough, maybe its like a hormonal thing that people with low ig just have more testosterone although my best friend in high school was the valedictorian of our class and she was as horny as they come. maybe it's just me. sex creates too many problems, issues but its like we all need to express those feelings and I haven't been able to  oh well it's been 20 minutes and I'm tired ",1
1669,"Well, well, what to write about?  I'm sure this topic comes up often in a stream of conciousness writing assignment. I really wanted to complete this assignment a few days ago. I had an interesting dream that I think probably had some significant psychological value. I'm not sure if I can remember much of it, but I'll try to recall. Nope, sorry. Ha ha. Let's see, it said to write about your current observations. Here's what's happening: music is playing, room mate's music is also playing. I guess I should try to find a song that might be relevant to our next discussion topic in class, but I'm not sure what that is right now. It really makes me mad that I actually tried to go do a load of laundry and all the machines are full. I can't believe that the entire dorm of Prather is supposed to share only four washing machines. That really sucks. I hate doing laundry as it is, but I refuse to wait in line. So, I decided to come do this assignment and figured the line would be gone. This is a good song, 311 - Amber. This is a slooowww twenty minutes. Last night was pretty boring, I didn't know of a whole lot going on. I should have called that Mila chick or that Meggie girl. They're pretty hot. Wonder if they're interested in me?  I just met them, guess I shouldn't really wonder about that yet. They're cool to hang out with, except Meggie's friend Michelle is a BITCH. I can't believe I took them out and they left with some of their friends. Ah, Counting Crows, Mr. Jones- good tune!  I think I'll call Mary Beth later and see what's up with Mila. I wish I would have eaten lunch before I started this. pretty hungry. Wow, a whole 13 and a half min. left to go. Ha, Will just walked in here to see if I thought his hair was cool. Jack and him are crazy guys. I wonder what I should go get for lunch today?  I guess I'll ask Ian what he feels like. I wonder if there's a length requirement on this assignment?  Probably not. I bet some people will be half-ass'n though. I need to figure out what other homework I need to do this weekend. I know I have some math to work on if I have time, but I really need to read that Philosophy first. The last book, Plato's Phaedo, was somewhat interesting, but was disheartening to learn that he was wrong at the discussion section on Friday. I just need to look at my PDA, I put all my assignments in there on Friday, I think. Man, I hope I can get some tickets to the UT and A and M game. Or the UT OU game. I don't understand the concepts of the draw exactly. The little draw sheet says I need to check out a website to get a wristband for the draw. I wonder what's going on back in Corsicana?  Probably not a whole lot. I guess I should call Mom here after I get done. I forgot to call her yesterday. What else do I need to do today?  I'll feel better after I get done with this, it's been kind of hanging over my head since it's been assigned. I really feel sorry for whoever might read this, it's probably incredibly boring. I wonder what anyone can tell about me by stream of conciousness. Let's see, Ian just walked by and wanted me to type   Zestfully Clean.   Guess we'll go eat in about 5 minutes. He thinks I should just be typing randomly instead of in sentences. Oooh, only four more minutes. I wonder how long this will be. I think those chairs we bought at Academy for the room yesterday are going to work out pretty well. I really like the table too. I just hope that after we buy the carpet that the room can be rearranged into a more efficient arrangment. That would be cool if this thing had spell checker on it. I'm impressed by the HTML timer though. I should learn something about HTML programming. I think some class I had said we would, can't remember which one that was. Wouldn't that be cool to get to a length limit?  Let's see, back to things to do today. Eat lunch, do laundry, do homework. Call Mom, call Gary back, call Jon and those guys back. Maybe I should call Mila or Meggie?  I don't know, I just talked to them the other day. Might not be the best timing. Guess I should anyway. Man, I need to stop spending money. I want to add up my receipts and see how much I have spent. This is goin to be a killer Visa bill month. Time's almost up! Yea!   ",0
1835,     Holy crap I should hurry and type. This is going to be a long time. I am already bored. Why do I have to do this. My wrist hurts typing like this. What is this going to prove. Ouch. my leg itches. So does my neck but I can't stop typing because if i do then this will be a complete failure i wonder what is on tv  my back itches i hope i don't smell bad should i be using punctuation oh well guess i won't this is really long i can't believe i have to do this i wonder how fast i can type i wish that i could watch tv later on im going to go and get something to eat what should that be i don't kow i think that i will have pizza more than likely that sounds good i need to use the restroom something smells good it smells like popcorn i wonder if there is a movie on i like watching movies remember that on time when i was at this movie with my friends and during the middle of the movie he said   this game is over   it was so funny i want to watch some cartoons like the transformers i wonder why that show is not on anymore i mean it was like my favorite show ever. my neighbor is blasting some excellent music. It sounds like it is punk which i enjoy very much. i want to stop typeing sargent door locks i want some milk i haven't had a good glass of whole milk since i have been here. All there is is 2% 1% or skim and those are all really gross. i can't see how anyone would drink that it is like watered down milk. but i guess not to many people really drink that. yes only 13 mins left for me to type. my hands are getting tired. it is quite cool in my room i wish that i was in jester and not in moore hill all my friends are in jester and that makes me feel bad that i don't get to see themall the time hey jerk face turn your music down it is making my stuff move on my desk. i hope that changing things into paragraphs is not required becaue if that is then i will probably fail but then again this just to written in a stream of total conscienceness so i guess that i don't really even need to stop to put periods in do i i need to take a nap this is really hard because i don't know if i am really even typing what i am think at least i don't have to worry about my laundry it was done yesterday. i can't believe how bad our team played on saturday we didn't even score in the second half that is pathetic why must this be happening i need to go potty but i can't because of this stupid paper ya know what cartoons are an excellent choice to watch i mean like aqua teen hunger force that show makes me laugh so hard i need to download some of those and the show undergrads that was excellent to bad it was taken off the air. i wonder how much useless trivia i know i bet it is a lot but when it comes to actual knowledge i don't really know that much i wonder why that is. i need to go swimming i like swimming how the water feels nice and cold it makes you go faster than warm water i wonder if i can swim at the joe jamail swim center how much more do i have to type shut that music off it is driving me crazy complete silence in my room is no fun hey gabriel turn on the tv so that then i can at least watch something while i type that would be a good think i wonder what those marks on my closet door is from i bet i have horrible grammar but excellent typeing speed that is all you really need. i hope that i get a good grade on this paper and that all of this was worth my time okay only four minutes left come on kevin keep it together you can make it through this i wonder how much i have typed because if it is a lot that would be really surprising i am so happy that this is almost over because i don't think that i could have taken this i wonder who just got on IM because that would be better than this i really need to do some studying i hope that the next paper is a lot better than this one because i hate just writing about what i am feeling are thinking because it feels so forced and like i don't ha ha that jerk next door has just left excellent oh well back to talking about useless trivia i bet that you couldn't name all the states in 10 mins it is really hard only me and my best friend reed have been able to do it and it took me 8 mins and him 9 and a half no one else i have challenge has been able to do it it makes you want to shoot yourself in t ,0
2055,"Today has been an absolutely great day, except for the weather. Austin has extremely crazy weather. One minute, it was bright and sunny outside, and the next it was raining cats and dogs!  Of coarse, it continued to do this for the rest of the day. Now that I am in my dorm room, I am beginning to think about what my mom and other friends are doing. It makes me a little sad to think that I am here and cannot be with them. Normally, I do not get homesick, but for the last couple of days I have been missing everyone extremely. I am sure that they are all having fun where they are, but I feel sure that they must miss me too. I just got done talking to my mom, and she said that it is very sunny down in Corpus Christi right now. I miss the excruciating sun that comes along with the cool breeze there. Now, my roommate just walked in, and I really want to go outside because she let some hot air in. It is so cold in this room. Our thermos stat is in the room across the hall from ours, and the girls in that room will not change it. They keep telling us that it is so hot in there room, but I cannot stand it. It is so cold in our room; I always walk around with a blanket. In Corpus, it is never cold, not even in the winter time. It truthfully only get down to about sixty degrees in the winter. It's crazy!  I bet my friend Frances is having so much fun at Ole Miss. She calls me every couple of days. In Corpus, we were very close, so for her not to call me that much means she is very busy and having a great time. I wonder a lot about how all my other friends are doing. Another one of my best friends just started at Princeton. I hope she likes it. I know her classes will be hard. I do like it here though. I am just beginning to make friends, and I think as time goes on it will get easier and easier. At least, that is what everyone tells me. I went to draw for a football wrist band today. My number was terrible. There is absolutely no way that I am going to get tickets. I wish I could have though. It would have been so much fun! I am not a big football fan, but because OU is such a big rival, it would have been exciting!  Gosh, it is so cold in here. I feel like my fingers are going to fall off. I hope the rest of the year it is not going to be like this. My roommate is now studying so I will have to be quiet for the rest of the night, but that's ok. I just go outside to talk on the phone or downstairs to watch tv. I believe that is what I will do after I finish this assignment because I really do not have much more homework to do. Actually, just kidding; I have a big economics quiz that I need to study for after I am done. Oh well another fun filled night of homework. This school is much more difficult than my high school. I miss the simplicity of high school. it wsa so much fun. Ok, my time is up so good bye. ",0
348,it has been raining for the past 4 days and I guess that has  a lot to do with everyone's attitudes. I feel a little relieved and tired though I had my first test of the semester this morning. I feel tired because I spent the majority part of the weekend partying rather then studying like I should have. now I was forced to cram study this morning just because of my laziness and inability to control my desires to go out with my friends. I should recover with a good nights sleep tonight. I called my father today. I'm trying to get on his good side now because he has been very disappointed in me. for some reason I seem to keep getting myself in situations that are to his beliefs not appropriate. the bad part about it is that I know that I am doing wrong but I still continue to do other things that make feel that he has failed as a parent. I guess he think is that if I am not perfect then he has failed as a parent. I'm trying to get it to him that I still have a lot of things going for me. I guess as a parent you want what's best for your child. so any little flaw on my part makes him feel that he did not do a good job raising me. I feel totally different though. I believe that I have thee best parents in the world because they have provided me with al the possible things to help me better myself in every way possible. in other matters work is going pretty well I will probably be getting a raise soon. my performance has been really well so maybe it will be a substantial raise            ,1
2342,"the weekend was nice. an old family friend came up to visit. I've known him since 3rd grade I think? something like that. bowling. Bumming around. Gaming. pool. Eating. Etc etc. Was fun. now back to class after a long weekend. ugh. These classes aren't very interesting. But that's ok. it's just basic sequence right now. once I start taking major sequence classes. I think it will become more interesting. these classes just seem like a hassle. I never liked writing assignments. Mostly because I've never been a strong writer. I'm not very skilled at thinking of what to write. words never seem to flow. I don't know. I really wonder what I'll do with my life. biomedical engineering sounds all fancy and stuff. But will it really provide me with a decent life in the future? I really don't know. it doesn't seem like there's much flexibility with this major. I do take cem, phys, bio courses and stuff. So it seems like my work covers over areas from different majors. I guess I'll have a wide variety of knowledge. But I won't be an expert in any of the areas. plus with competition from foreign sources. The future scares me even more. I guess I do get somewhat bitter when I think about how researchers may earn something like 40-50K a year. But then the MBA that hired them gets 100+ perhaps? that's just bs. I don't think it's very fair at all. But nothing's ever very fair. man. I really want a job. I have time I guess. But no transportation. and then not all the jobs I've looked through were at the right times. I applied for something at the LAN cave in jester. I hope I get that. then I need to start looking for scholarships. Internships. Summer research. Etc etc etc. oh yeah. I need to look for an apartment for next year. I really don't want to end up in the dorms again. as much as I like the fast internet. I really want a room of my own. And the freedom that comes with living in a place of your own. I guess it is pretty free in the dorms. But I can't blast the music when I want to. Or turn up the volumes for gaming. besides. Blanton isn't really the best dorm out there either. not having a sink in the room really sucks. it's not a big deal to walk to the bathroom. But for stuff like making ramen. A quick wash of the face. Or maybe just a drink of cool water. I have to make a trip. I guess I'm just lazy. But it's odd that some dorms have sinks in the room and others don't. only ten minutes have passed. Feels like a lot more than that. time passes slowly when you're not having much fun. I like seeing things animated. Or in motion. sitting and writing. Or reading. They're not that interesting. I do like reading about computer technology and astronomy and cars and stuff. But it's hard to make myself sit down and read a book like harry potter. I haven't done that in years. yeah. I don't think I've willingly read a fiction book since middle school. I remember those redwall and mossflower books. I guess they were the trend back in the day. I signed up for the 3rd coast gaming competition later this month. aiya. I'm a bit worried. playing at the arcades isn't like playing on a console. the controls feel different. plus. When I play at the arcades. I get beaten a lot. I guess it kind of hurts my confidence. But that's ok. I'll just see how I match up with the other people in the competition. besides. It's only $10. And I think it'll be fun to watch the l337 play. I could really go for a huge huge glass of orange juice right now. Maybe some pluckers wings too. I don't know. What should I write about. ""anything at all"". it's so vague. I like having a little more of an idea of what I'm doing. *shrug*. Oh well. don't use this as a cry for help huh. I don't really cry out for help. well. Not in very noticeable ways. keeping secrets hurts you huh. I guess I've probably shortened my life a lot then. aiya. Being Asian. That's my excuse. the guy isn't really supposed to show weakness. Heh. What a stupid way of thinking. But after 18 years. It's hard to break the habit. I wonder how people can be so carefree. I hope the year goes well. I really do. Too much tension everywhere. I really just want to break lose and forget all the responsibilities I have. But I don't think I can. it's just not something I'd do. I'm tired. I need to find something. Someone amazing. I don't want to just cruise through life. ",0
2276,"Ok. I'm here in the CPE building during mandatory study time. I'm trying to catch up on some missed work, like this stream of consciousness writing exercise which I couldn't do before hand because I lost my class code number.   Well. Anyway, let's see what's on my mind. The Mets are really bad. I've actually begun rooting against them so they'll fall into last place and Art Howe will be fired. He really is an Awful manager. Personally, I liked Bobby Valentine. Sure he had a couple rough moments, but overall he was a much more effective manager. Hmmm. well. my friend Scott Neff, who used to work for the mets, sat down with Jim Duquette the other day and JD pretty much vented all of his anger about this season and his distaste for Art Howe. They've begun to give him nicknames in the clubhouse. For example: The Wizard, The Wiz, and The Grandfather. There was a little bit of a pause there because I took a swig of water. I'm pretty sure the guy behind me is looking at what I'm writing. Is that a little bit disconcerting. Yes. Oh well. I'm glad I will be taking advantage of this time. 3 hrs of studying a night can really keep you on track. I just turned my cell phone off. James has handwriting that's hard to understand. My battery life remains surprisingly high. Wireless internet is pretty awesome. Wow. This is the first time I've used wireless internet. I wonder how long I've been typing? Probably 8 or 9 minutes which means that I should probably stop around 8:56. I wonder what I'm going to have to do after 11 pm. I should have brought those quarters. I knew I should have. But then I would have been late. I've got this compulsion for grammatical correctness. Is that weird? Well, I talked to my mom today. She and my dad took the top down in the convertible for the first time today. That's sick. My dads had that car since before I left for school. That's over a month now and he hasn't even taken the roof down!!! He spent 70 grand almost on a convertible and doesn't even bother to take the roof down! tell me that's not a disgusting waste. Someone came in and asked for the sign in sheet. I wonder how the ghs theater stuff is going. I thought Id miss it a little bit. And I kind of do. I miss the actual acting aspect of it. But you can't imagine the relief of not having to deal with kohn at all. It should be pretty cool to come back home though and visit. It must be all the more liberating to view that whole situation from the outside. Or maybe it will just bring back weird memories. My finger. No my thumb really itches. I'm thinking I should wash my hands. They feel pretty grimy. I did wash them after I ate that sushi though. The sushi was surprisingly good. On the other hand it should be good if its $8. The smell in the room. Well there is no distinguishable smell. Back in jester though. WOW. That place smells incredibly bad. It's always a mixture of body odor, popcorn and some sort of Lysol. Really nasty. I wonder how Lauren is doing? I really like that girl, but lately my attraction to her is more as a friend. Sexually, she is pretty frustrating. I assume all Mormons are. But when I have numerous girls around me who are much more. um. Liberal sexually, it makes me think twice more often than I'd like. I wonder what she thinks of me. That situation with Tyler is fu. Messed up. I'm sure she knows that. But now that I think of it. That whole thing is pretty messed up. OH well. Someone came in the room and kindly asked us to be quiet. He's walking over to someone. Whispering in his ear. Smiling. Oh well. I think my battery life is running low. I think my 20 mins is up. ",0
300,"Writing about the stream of consciousness is really not my thing. The only  thing I understand is that I am suppose to put my feelings and thoughts as of  now, on paper. Well, what I am feeling right now is tiredness. Last night I  only had 5 hours of sleep and I am really tired and sleepy right now. I figure, since I have time to kill, I better do it completing an assignment that requires action and movement to keep me awake. I am suppose to meet a friend for lunch at 3 o'clock and it is merely 1:30. As I said before, I really need a nice  comfortable mattress so I can take a nap. Other than feeling really tired and lazy, I am also feeling happy. I am glad that I am where I am and grateful  for my parent. I realized that that last sentence really didn't make any sense. Oh, well. In a way I can blame the tiredness I have inside of me on myself and  partially on my cousin. I blame myself because I stayed up late on the phone talking to the friend that is taking me out to lunch today. Then I can blame my cousin because she wanted me to take her to get her immunization shot. Then  what turns out is that the clinic we went to did not operate immunization. Which brings me now to understand that I am frustrated as well. Being that the  clinic that we went to, didn't do immunization, I am going to have to wake up  early again on a different day to bring her to another clinic. I really, really hate waking up early. No matter what it is for, it has to be pretty important for me to get away from dreamland. This seat that I am sitting on right now is really too high for me. Either that or I am really short. The seat is so high that it has my legs hanging off the  ground. Which really sucks because it is making my knees hurt. They feel sore now. The truth is, is that I am really not that short. I am 5'4"", so that is about average. Anyway, I realize now that writing about your consciousness is really strange and something your think about at the spur of the moment. Trying to put every- thing down is kind of frustrating when you cannot type as fast as you think. Well, the 20 minutes are up and I have to run. I don't want to bore the person who will be reading this. Although it is already boring as is. ",0
1879,"   In doing this writing assignment I was unsure of what i would be writing. I am having a pretty good day and I hope that it continues to be good. Transfering to UT this semester has been a great eye opener. This is my first time to live by myself and be away from home. There seems to be so much pressure right now with school and bills. It is hard sometimes to be alone, but I was the one that begged my parents to get me an apartment to myself. I wish sometimes that I would have lived with roommates, so that I would be more familiar with the people and things around me. I like having my own space and freedom, and I'm sure I can adjust the the loneliness. I have been feeling the depression kick in during the last 2 weeks. It is hard, and my phone bill is high, but I know that this is only the beginning of my life. My goal is to get my bachelor's degree in Accounting and then have a great job offer before graduating. Life seems like a blurr sometimes, even when you think you have it all planned out. I don't know what I really want from life besides being happy. I may be greedy, but I want to make a good amount of money, so that I will not have to worry about needs. I have a lot of pressure from my Dad. I have never felt like I can please him in what I do. This is probably why I have such high goals for myself. I've got to come to the realization that I don't need to make my Dad proud of me, but instead make myself proud of me. That is a hard thing to do. I am very critical of myself and if I don't do the very best, sometimes I feel like a failure. Hopefully someday I can feel pleased with myself and my life. I'm not sure what else to write. Well, I miss my friends back home a lot. My two best friends are both far away. I can't really go seem them on the weekends now because of my part-time job. But hopefully we will keep in touch regulary. Psychology is going to be lots of fun this semester. I love the way Mr. Pennebaker teaching. It's make the classroom environment much more relaxed and fun. I hope that I can also learn more about the emotional and physical behaviors that I possess. I often worried that I am crazy, jusk kidding. But there is a point where everyone has their own bit of craziness inside them. There are times that I feel like two different people. It happens very rarely, but I can see at times the difference between how I act and who I really am. It's scary, but I think normal. I sometimes feel like I am putting on a show for others to see and approve of. I have been told that I am a very nice person, but when I see the difference I feel like I am just acting that way. I don't know exactly what I mean, and I may never understand myself. There are numerous questions that I have about life and people. I don't have to know all the answers, but to understand most of them would be meaningful to me. I came from a divorced family, and when I was young I was physically abused. I didn't know the extent of my abuse until my older sister would tell me about it. I must have blocked it all out because I can only recall the moments before and after I was hurt. Which it scares me if I may someday have it all come back to me and it may be too much to handle. When I grew older I was raised in a strict Christian household which has an affect on who I am. I believe in God and Jesus Christ, but there are many questions that I can't answer. But I don't think that life is about knowing all the answers. I just want to understand them. I am just going on about whatever. I kind of feel like I shouldn't have been so personal about my life ",1
1278,"How revealing am I supposed to be in this assignment? I can never track my thoughts. They always flit around. I am trying to think of something brilliant to write so I won't appear to be a complete imbecile. I just checked the time and just realized how difficult third is going to be. What am I thinking. I think I need to do well in college. Is my studying enough? I mean really. I am not studying as much as you hear is recommended but I feel as if I have a reasonable grasp on what I am learning. How much of an expert am I supposed to leave each class. Chemistry is going to kick my ass. I need to try harder. Why can't I get it. My sat scores are so high but I can't imagine why. I'm supposed to be smarter. Smarter than I am. Smarter than your average Joe. When I talk I am impressive. People applaud me and remark about me as if I'm brilliant. I'm not. I'm just good at bullshit. I think I want to marry my boyfriend. He doesn't treat me well. But I am a bitch sometimes and not a very good person. Does that justify the way he treats me? I cannot afford to think about him all the time. He will cause me to fail. Or so my mom says. The minute I think of her saying not to think about him I do. How can I not. I didn't do this on my word processor first. I mean, what is the point of writing this so freshly and giving you all this insight if I just decide to edit it later and erase my imperfections. My typos are me. I make mistakes. I misspell. Rarely of course. I am thinking nothing right now. I wonder if other people do that. Think of nothing. I think of a blank canvas. Is that nothing? I guess not but I believe you can understand what I am trying to say. you know, every single night that we have been here my boyfriend and I have spent together? My bed is too small. I want to sleep next to him more than anything but it is just so uncomfortable. You can't have your cake and eat it too. Hmmmm. I am so deliciously tired right now. You know the kind of tired where you are cold and you know that nothing on the planet would feel as good as your comforter. Will is annoying me. He has this dumb ass book he will not put down. I hate competing for his attention. Asshole. Oh yeah Will is my boyfriend. I forgot to mention my honey's name. Back to my tired. I just want to stretch out lazily in my bed. It is not really body fatigue. I just want to to go into my cocoon. Something nonacademic. Something cozy. It is mental and social fatigue which I suffer from. Six more minutes. I need to study more and remember how to do empirical stoichiometry. Oh yeah. You can bet I checked the spelling on that one. Today I was called the ""s"" word by another black person. Sellout. Will is white. Black people hate that. DO you know that in my entire life I have never had a true black friend. The black girls seem to hate me. They think that I am a snob. The black guys listen to the black girls. And I listen to my heart. I love Will. I worry about him. Being with a black girl makes him lack in the eyes of many. It makes him black and he does not get that yet. When he loses his first opportunity, or does not get that promotion he will. Then he will leave me. It's all a matter of time. Why would someone like him want someone like me. Why would someone like me want someone like him. He does not realize that failure in life is not an option with me. Guess what its' been? 20 minutes.

1598,"     I'm sitting here thinking about what in the world my friends behind me are talking about, it's pretty funny. we just got finished eating at taco bell, which at the time sounded like a good idea, but i'm now seriously regretting that choice. My friend is quizzing me about what I am typing and it's really messing me up, she can be so obtrusive sometimes. I can't complain though, because I came here to use her computer so I could print off something, so I should be thankful, right? Oh yeah, I'm using proper grammar, hope that wasn't part of the assignment. I just thought about how long twenty minutes is. This assignment could never end. My friend didn't go to class yesterday, so her and her roommate are talking about this, who knew something so goofy could be talked about for five minutes, but who am I to judge, because I do the same thing. Michelle is trying to explain what happened on All My Children to me, not taking into account I am trying to do homework, but the bad thing i actually want to know. I don't feel good, so if this paper is a little weird take into account I am probably delusional from sickness and maybe fever. My nose is running, my throat hurts. Okay now my friend is saying she would have beat me in grade point in high school if she has worked on. she has been saying this for three freaking year, what is the statute of limitations on dwelling?  Oh my God, my nose will not quit running, that makes it very hard to type. You ever realize when you are told to write what you think, the pressure makes it impossible to keep your thoughts on logical things. So instead I just keep thinking how,   I don't know what I'm going to write about  . Now my friends are talking about this show called the rerun show, where they make fun of old shows, this one being saved by the bell. I used to love that show, i can even remember most of the episodes. We are so retarded, I can't believe we are actually talking about this. Remarkably, this conversation has been going on for eight minutes. I actually kept tabs on the little timer thing. Michelle has hairy legs, she keeps annoucing it to everyone, who cares. Although, it is kind of gross because she is wearing shorts. Nobody is talking behind me now so once again my thoughts are on the paper and I am drawing a total blank. When this happens I tend to get nervous and my typing gets extremely bad, so I am having to delete alot. Now my friends are watching me and that makes me even more nervous. Oh I bet this makes for an exiting paper for someone to read, the ranting and raving of a sick, saved by the bell loving freak. Something horribly embarrassing happened to me today, I was telling my friend about how my professor says the word Chicago weird, guess who was behind me. the professor no less, I am not sure i will ever fully recover from that.

2337,"Well, I today I'm feeling pretty lovely. I woke up this morning and went to the gym. Afterwards I took a shower and went downstairs to get something to eat. I met up with this boy I am talking to, he's really sweet and sexy. He makes me feel special. But I'm being very cautious in this little relationship, because I tend to wear my heart on my sleeve, and I don't feel like getting hurt. Anyways,  my sandwich was really good. I'm also watching Seinfeld right now. Actually if you want to be technical with it, I'm not watching it because I'm typing right now, but it's on in the background. But yah, I love Seinfeld. I think it's the greatest show in the world. I am still amazed at how someone can write a nine season show about NOTHING. That's crazy. You know what else I think is crazy?  I don't know how in world I'm going to manage my time between classes and work-study and the gym and my social life. It's like there is so much to do. Especially with all this reading I have to do for psy. Now that's crazy!  Why do we have to read so much. Why can't the teacher just teach it to us. Maybe I'm just being lazy. Who knows?  Yes! Another episode of Seinfeld is coming on. Anyways, on Monday there's a Seinfeld marathon. It starts at 7am until the end of Labor Day. That is really cool. I can't wait. But yah. I wonder what grade I'm going to get in this class. I've done all my experiments. I be damned if I had to write some 5 page psychological paper. So you know I got started on those experiments ASAP. Okay! Anyways, I really don't know what else to write about. So lets see. let me think. What else can I talk about. Oh yeah! There's a football game tonight. I hope we win. I wish I could go, but I didn't but any tickets. I don't even know where to buy tickets from. I should of just got a sports package. That would of made my life a whole lot easier. I have this football player in my class. Actually he's in two of my classes. He's nice. We study together, because our rhetoric class is kind of difficult, and he's always falling asleep in class. I don't blame him. They work those football players really hard. A little bit too hard. That's just ridiculous. Sometimes I feel for them, because like how do they expect them to do good in school, when there only getting like 5hrs of sleep a day. That's not good, especially with all that strenuous activity they do. I know I wouldn't be able to do it. I know after I come back from the gym, I'm ready to go back to sleep. So I really feel for the football players. But I guess if you really want to make it to the NFL, you got do it. You got to stick with it. And that really goes for anything. If you want to accomplish any of your goals, then you have to stick with the game plan. Anyway, you know it really hasn't hit me that I am in college yet. I mean it kind of hit me last week, when I was going out with some of my friends. And it was like, I don't have to call my mom and tell her what I'm doing, I don't have to worry about her sending out a search party for me. I don't have to answer to nobody. It's so great. I love this!  Anyway, the way I see it if I just find out some way to manage my time with work, gym, classes, and my social life then everything should just work out fine. Yah in a perfect world. Anyways, looks like I got about 4 more minutes to right. Okay lets, see. You know what my favorite episode of Seinfeld is?  The very first episode, when Jerry and George where doing laundry. That's a really good episode. I know like every word, scene, move. everything about that episode. Anyways, looks like I'm going on only two minutes left. Two minutes and forty seconds. Two minutes and 30 seconds. Two minutes and 20 seconds. Two minutes and 10 seconds. Two minutes and now we have ONE MINUTE LEFT. All right I'm on a roll here. Lets see, I guess I'll just sign off now. Well this has been really fun. I hope whoever is reading this has enjoyed reading this. Have a great day and a great like. 5 seconds left . and GOOD BYE! ",0
1098,"I don't really want to go to my BA101 class today. Sleep sounds so good right now. I don't think I have enough energy to sit through another hour and half class, since this morning I sat through three of them in a row. Oh yeah I better remember to call Sheetal so we can go study at the PCL or FAC. I don't know if I want to study with a whole group of people but maybe I'll give it a try. This is so cool. Getting graded on a writing assignment that is of our thoughts and feelings. Reminds me of my summer English 1301 class that I took where we had to write journals everyday and as long as we did them and turned them in it was ok. It is sooo freaking hot outside. And I am so tired, mainly because of the heat. Hmmm. I wonder if Nancy has called. I feel so bad for her. Anyways, that is kind of depressing just thinking about it. I feel so stressed out. These first three weeks at UT has been busy. Not with work and stuff but with things like getting everything together and making sure that I have insurance, my checking account is correct and other important things. I miss the home food so much! But I'll live, it's not too bad over here. I haven't seen any guys here. Hahah! Well I have but I don't think I will end up dating any right now. My hands are getting so tired right now. I really feel like sleeping. I think after BA101 I will go to eat at Kinsolving and then head to the library or something. These labs and libraries on campus are so good. They have everything and you can use them whenever. Stephanie should be coming next Thursday to that Career Day thing so hopefully I'll see her. I am so confused on what to go into, like majors and stuff. I'm thinking about MIS but marketing sounds so good right now. Like I'm more interested in that kind of stuff and things that I really would enjoy doing. I know it doesn't have a lot of money or anything, but that is not what is important really to me. I mean yeah I want to earn a good living but that's not my main goal in life to be rich more like be happy. So I don't know. Just a confused freshman I guess!. Maybe I'll find out pretty soon. Man this time is going by so slowly. I've only been writing for ten minutes. Just realized how many thoughts flow through my mind in such small amount of time. Man I hope I get a chance to do a project because I do not want to write a paper. That sounds too boring. Being a part of an experiment sounds so cool, never really done that before. Ok I wish I had my headphones, too like the girl next to me. I need to listen to some music. I wonder if we are all going to go out this Thursday night to sixth street. I kind of want to. I feel so bad for Sarika, cause of her roommate. She is kind of mean, actually she is very rude and catches an attitude with every little thing. Even if she does not know you, she'll be so rude. Dang girl. Hahah. Ok well I need to find where my BA101 class is so I will be going now. So much for this writing assignment! I think my twenty minutes are up. Well actually they are almost up. But it said at least. Oh well I guess I'll go anyway. ",0
315,"I am wondering whether or not I should try out for the dance team. In away I want to so I will have something to be a part of but at the same time I'm fearing the inevitable rejection. Rather than be rejected I'm just not going to try but then I'll always wonder whether or not I could have made it if I had tried. If I do try out and then I fail everybody will know that I FAILED AND I'll be embarrassed. I risked failure when I pledged but I did it anyway. My neighbor failed and I didn't think any less of her so why should I think any less of myself. I'll look fat in the leotard and tights, but one reason I want to do it is so I'll stay in shape. Everything is too competitive. I wonder what my cats doing since when you gave this assignment you mentioned a dos so I started to think about my cat. Then the picture frame I got today since I have a picture of my cat but I have to get another frame for my cat picture. My entire room is decorated in cat things. I found a gecko in my room today. There not have as big as the lizards we used to find in the house when I lived in Arizona. they used to be at least a foot long. I wonder what I'm going to do tomorrow I have reading to do in the morning. I can't help but put in capital letters at the beginning of sentences and periods. My mom wanted me to copy this and run spell check, how stupid. that what you get for having an English teacher for a mother. I want to get a calendar to put up all my things. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m scared to death I'll miss something like a homework assignment or test. I wonder if I need to be studying more often. It seems like I'm not doing enough. I don't know what I'll do if I fail. I hope I'm doing this write. It seems like the paper is just going on and on and on. I seem to worry about failure alot. I hate typing, I never memorized where the keys were so I keep goofing. My parents always told me to take typing but I was too lazy and afraid I was going to not get an A. I wonder how my sister got involved, society of women engineers. I say a bent today on the way to class. The other graduate students are coming on the 19 here. I bet it would be easier if I didn't repeat to myself what I was typing I need to go by the Newman center to meet n9ice boys. Why bother I never going to get married I probably not even going to get good grades and I'll never get in to med school and I'm going to flunk out. God I hope not or I'll end up as a house wife not that that's bad but I always wanted a career and my sisters so successful. My parents would be so disappointed. Now I'm starting to sound negative like that survey said but I was much more optimistic in the survey I wonder if those ever prove anything or if people really lie to themselves when they're doing those even though they think they're being realistic this girl beside me took forever doing the survey. How much time do I have left? IS anybody even ever going to read this? Probably  that was why it was done on the internet that reminds me of the guy I sat next to in Chem. I hope he doesn't think that I was offended by his remark it doesn't bother me I'm used to it with Adam and all. I feel like I've typed forever and it looks like nothing on this sheet the way it goes to infinity on the right. I keep on thinking about what to type instead of just typing what I'm think I just its just a habit from writing so many in class essays and such I'm so happy I passed the AP that way I don't have to take any English classes and I showed Mr. Cody and my mother I wonder what Patrick's doing. He got a 5. The girl at dinner the other night was so stupid she thought she got a 560 and the SAT's and the AP's were the same thing that's why I'm not a pom that and the fact I'm not talented enough since I spent a lot of high school studying instead of dancing or anything else. I can't imagine having three hours of practice a day. I guess I had as much with games and all but it seems like a lot less. I had a ton of fun at games though and wouldn't have given it up for it now. That's how I tell whether or not it was worth it if I would trade it for something else now not that I could go back and repeat it so I guess it doesn't matter anyway.   ",1
2029,"ok, so I am supposed to write about what I am feeling, hearing and thinking. all that, so, the trucks outside my window are driving around backwards for some strange reason and the beeping is really a pain. It starts at 7:30 or 8:00 in the morning and the beeping goes on all day long. My roommate wants to know how much work those trucks can actually accomplish when they are driving backwards!  lol, I agree and would really like to know, all I see when I look out my window is a big whole in the ground, not to much progress. but I am sure the construction will be moving along slowly but surely. Oy veh, I have not typed in such a long time, I have gotten so slow. I am just like my grandma, new technology drives me nuts. My computer, phone, everything, too confusing!  I like having no alarm clock or phones or computers or anything, but its all just part of america I guess, so along the lines of beeping, the door to my floor is beeping again, the alarm has gone off every time someone goes in or out of the door. It's all part of dorm life I guess, luckily I can sleep through anything so it doesn't really bother me much, just when I am trying to study but that is why we have libraries. I am a little worried though that I won't wake up is there is a fire drill or something. My roommate (I wonder how you spell that - room mate?  roommate? or roommate?) anyhow, she will wake me up. thank goodness. my suitemates just made dinner even though its late and it smells YUMMY!  I think it's pork though so I'll have to miss out on this one. It's amazing the things you can cook in the microwave these days. EZmac seems a little scary but most food turns out pretty good. I really miss my moms cooking, I think that is got to be one of the hardest parts of being away from home, the food and the fact that me family would always eat together. It's so quiet here I can tell the weekend is winding down. Friday and Saturday nights are so noisy and something is always happening. Now its all hush hush. I've only been typing for nine minutes and I can't believe how much random stuff I have thought of. I took a Yoga class today with a friend, I had never taken one before and somehow you move around for like an hour and come out of the class feeling like you just took a great nap for the whole time. The instructor played this awesome music (the only word I can think of to try to describe it is zen""), it was happy and sad at the  same time. Very interesting. I have taken up going to the gym because it is about the only past time that lets me avoid my school work and procrastinate without feeling too guilty. It's a great excuse, so to the gym I go. It's fun though, I made friends with all the crickets that live in and around the pool. I have never seen such big crickets before in my life, only in Pinnochio and stuff like that, they are huge here, it's like they are on steroids or something. Bugs are not my favorite but I guess they can enjoy swimming too. I want some popcorn, ya know, like the really good but really bad for you movie theater popcorn. How come everytime someone pops a bag, it seems like everyone in the world can smell it!  yum!  so, my walls are covered in post-its, I always need a reminder for something and my room is finally starting to look a bit ""lived-in"", the walls are so bare and the rooms are so boring. I like things bright and busy busy busy!  My roommates favorite color is pink and her whole side of the room is light pink, which just happens to be my least favorite color, I think that may have something to do with me never wanting to hang out in my room, it's really awful. She is awesome and we get along perfectly except for out choice of color so I really am lucky. But anyhow, it's amazing how a color can affect your mood so much (or at least mine). I really wish I could type faster. Mas rapido!  I haven't used my computer hardly at all, I got used to living without technology this summer and I loved it. People here rush all the time, we need to learn how to take it easy and just enjoy everything that is around us. We are so silly even though we pride ourselves with being so advanced, I think we just get caught up in it all and forget how to take a break and chill. I am tired of thinking, I have been doing it all day, I wish I had a switch to just turn my brain off for a few minutes. My roommate just walked in, she opened the door and I jumped, now she is looking for her key, what a bummer to lose. That or an I'D, your I'D is like your life here, ok, well, my time is running out, hope you enjoyed reading what all was floating around in my head!  wow, done at exactly the right time. woo hoo!

453,"I thought I would because I've visited with my friends so many times before, but now that I'm actually here it's finally true. I'm away from my parents, it's so great. I live with three great girls in my suite and we're so popular here. I've always been a socially outgoing person, but now I feel like it's going to work. there are always large numbers of people in our living room, bringing in food or beer to contribute to our refrigerator; everyone munches from it. and it's OK. the RA told us about this girl in another room who got so upset because her roommate ate her store bought cookies without asking; she called her mom and was so upset. I'm so glad its not like that here. we all contribute and all consume. But it's not like there's always noise and party's here. only when we all decide. if one person wants to read or study or sleep, we're really considerate. I hope that lasts, I'm pretty sure it will. At our building there are many foreign exchange students which is always a plus because, come on, who minds a foreign accent every once in a while. this guy from Belgium and this one from England are always watching TV in our room, which is another amusing thing: we don't have cable, or an antenna, or a VCR, so we only get FOX Channel 7. We sit around and watch whatever's on. in one way it's good because we don't have arguments over which channel to watch. maybe simplicity is  the root of compromise. We had a floor meeting the other night here and they discussed some issues that had come up. it was so funny because almost all of them referred to our room's shananagans. This one guy came here from where he lives in a house to use the laundry (he's one of our friends- our referring to my roommate and I we've been friends since 2nd grad, long time, huh? ) anyway, he dropped like half a box of laundry detergent on the stairwell and no one noticed for a week. the RA got mad and cleaned it up herself, but it was amusing because he doesn't even live here. another thing was the ""stolen furniture"" incident. we are given this loveseat-type couch in our suite's living room that can maybe seat 3 people if you're lucky. and in the lobby of the 3rd floor in front of the elevator there are 2 large couches that just block the pathway, no one ever sits in them, and they could probably seat 5 or 6. so when no one was around, my suitemate and I and 3 other people that happened to b in our room at the time helped us move our dinky little couch into the lobby which is down the hall and around a corner. we hauled the large couch down the way and we had to tilt it sideways and temporarily knock off some of the ceiling tiles just to make it in the doorway without banging down the door across from us. now we have a nice couch that is well used and the RA's are threatening to do a room check to find it. why?  its going to more use. It's all kind of a double standard anyway. The head RA is always in our room hanging out and drinking our beer. he has a crush on me so he always brings us stuff and won't mention the couch to the others and lets us into the cafeteria at night. it's pretty funny, one night the night guard knocked on our door because someone had made a noise complaint. we opened the door and the guard stood in the threshold and the head RA stood behind the door quietly while we got reprimanded. it probably wouldn't have been in his best interests to b seen in there. He's only 20, but the building is changing management, so right now he's the head guy. its odd. I'm 18. finally. I could be in a management position at the pool I lifeguard at in the summers, next summer. it seems odd that I'm really an adult. when you're a kid u never think that you're ever going to get to the point where you decide when to come home and when to do this and what to do in this situation, type thing. its like the transition from high school to college really is that much of a change in that you're independent. it feels so good to finally b independent, financially, physically, emotionally. its wonderful responsibility. I am responsible for watching my budget, if I don't, no one will bail me out (well that's probably not true but you know). I guess I'm trying out freedom on borrowed wings, I can always have that security blanket if I want, but I don't want. I want to be independent. I am right now, I hope to stay that way ",1
913,"The way I feel has always been of interest to me. i have experienced so many emotions that at times my mind seem confused and bogged down with internal conflict. I have some what of a codependent personality and love to have relationships (longlasting perferably) with members of the opposite sex. To be completely honest, sex is usually not the primary motive for me in a relationship. Currently I feel somewhat lonely as all of my friends are currently in relationships that have been very beneficial to them. I live in an apartment which is not as advantageous as it seems. The people at Jester seem to be easily approached and my friends have met far more new people than I. I don't believe I am as happy about being in college for this reason. I love meeting new people. I find it hard to concentrate on work and am constantly thinking about certain people or friends I left behind. I seem to dwell on the past lately. I go on eating binges and then won't have an appetite for days to follow. I work out constantly and lately have been woried about my physical appearance. I many times dwell onthe question ""Why do I not have a girlfriend, why do they not find me attractive. ""  I guess part of the reason I feel this way is simply because as a child I was teased about being overweight. I guess I developed a level of self consciousness as a child and still to this day am woried about my weight. I've tried meeting people but the conventional means just do not seem to work for me. It is hard for me to approach a girl and that tends to bother me somewhat. Personally I tend to avoid large groups simply because id rather get acquainted with a person on a one on one basis. I also worry excessively about my grades. I guess from reading what I wrote my biggest feeling/emotion is lonliness. ",0
601,"But I can't go to sleep because I have mounds of homework to do. The drive back here from home, just wore me out completely, and that is why I didn't have any time earlier to do my homework. I still need to take a shower. Then I have to wake up early in the morning and figure out where my biology discussion class is, so I can go in there and take the dumb quiz that the TA gives out. Too bad, I am going to fail it. The lectures my prof. gives, just don't really make since. I wish that my best friend Natalie and I could've spent more time together when I was home this past weekend. I also wish that my boyfriend Mark would send me an email. I wish that we could somehow get passed this stupid problem we are having. It's hard enough him being in Virginia, then he has to go and get some weird attitude and get mad and not be himself. It is really making me mad, and sad all at once. I wish that I could see him, and knock some since into his head and then everything would be okay. Natalie is the only one that knows enough about us for me to talk to about our relationship problems. But I hate boring her to death with it, I don't want to get on her nerves about it. This past summer, everything was fine, and now it is all so different, I hate it. But there is nothing I can do about it. And then there is Matt which just gets on my nerves. He is my good friend from the past year, although we've known each other for going on 7 years. He just aggravates me, the way he is so scatter brained. I just get so frustrated, and tired of it. Poor guy, I feel sorry for him. Then, my mind always, swings back to Mark. I can't ever not think about us, and this problem we are having. I so need to talk to him about it because I can't function unless everything is resolved. And it is driving me absolutely CRAZY. But he won't talk about it, he won't talk to me. And I am not the kind of person that can just drop it. I can't just say, oh well, and then forget about it. I have it on me for quite a long while. Every day, I see or hear at least 15 things that remind me of him or us together. Its so depressing. I hate being this way, all depressed and not my peppy, cheerful self. Well, I see that the 20 minutes are up now. SO long. ",0

Ooo this key board is really dirty, I should clean it. should what a funny word. I should do lots of things. Sunday morning, man it is hot. my ac was out for the last two days, but it is on now so this world is alot nicer. I am in a better mood. I feel relaxed this morning, peaceful. Sundays seem to do that to me, especially when the Monday is going to be a holiday. The fan is blowing on me and I feel great. I ran this morning 8 miles around town lake and it has to be one of the hottest mornings yet. wow, very sticky. I felt exhausted and sick when I was done, but nothing water couldn't fix. The radio is on in my room the TV in the living room and my roommateÃ¯Â¿Â½s radio in her room. many a noises going through my head. Oh I need to change my calendar page tomorrow, I just noticed that. august is over, wow that went fast. each year seems to go faster then the last. I can remember being 16 thinking college would never come and now I am a junior and college is almost over! what happened. dishes I need to do the dishes before I leave today. I am going out to my ranch to meet up with my family for the day. Why is there chocolate in my bed? That is odd. The arch of my foot hurts. no good. can't have that for running. tomorrow there is a 4 mile race around town lake. 7:30 am. maybe IÃ¯Â¿Â½ll run in that, maybe IÃ¯Â¿Â½ll actually sleep in one day. I haven't yet. not really since last spring semester. It was the busiest summer that I have had in a long time. poof. Oh I need to write Andy a letter. I keep forgetting. It was nice to talk with him yesterday. especially since he paid the bill. That always helps. I have quite the movie collection going now I just noticed all my cassettes. I don't like this song playing now. hey the TV went off. I don't want to drive today. I am tired of driving. My relaxed attitude seems to be disappearing. I am beginning to think of all the readings I have to begin doing. I took 15 hours this summer so I am tired. what happened to that thing called break? I think it forgot me, but I had a great summer. can't complain, plus now I am that much more along. I am glad I did what I did. The list for Wal-Mart just was delivered to me by my roommate. hmmm what do I need or want, diet dr. pepper I have to have that stuff. yum, great for the caffeine. well the day should be one of reading and talking. I love the weekend life. Talk again with you later. Good bye. ",1
900,"I'm looking at a picture of my best friend who is now in Nashville adn I wonder what she is doing right now. I'm wondering what my boyfriend is doing at school at this very moment and why is every second centered around me like a movie or something, I think we should be able to take a sneek peek into others lives right when we want to. I've wanted to know why life isn't that easy. Pictures are supposed to make you happy and remember happy times yet when I see them I just think about times that will never take place again because they are in the past. Sometimes I seriously resent the past. I need to do my laundry and I need to put a different CD on the player because this one is getting old. I got two card for Greg and I need to get off my butt and get the stamps. My mind is just full of things I need to do but I figured I would get this one done first, before I forget to do it later. I'm still hungry and I'm not sure if it is out of boredom or what. I refuse to get the freshmen fifteen because I'm happy with my weight right now. I like to workout and I need to do it more now that I have the chance right now. I hope my mom is doing well at her job right now. I also hope I get to go home for labor day to see Greg for the first time in two weeks. I miss him so much, but if I stay busy it won't be that hard and will go real quick. Twenty minutes sure is a long time and I don't know how long I have been on the computer, it seems like the internet and email are the only links to people outside of UT. I would call more but bills are so expensive. I need to make my bed before I turn into a complete slob. The chair at this desk is way uncomfortable right now and my legs hurt from walking. My feet are going to look so ugly after one semester here but oh well. I'm going to get stamps after finishing this, I can't wait until it gets cold. Hot weather makes me so tired all the time. ",1
2064,"ok. so I am suppose to be writing for twenty minutes. well, this will be good typing practice. except in keyboarding class, we were told what to type. so this might be a problem. this seat is bothering me. it's hard to get comfortable in it. its really low as well. and these stupid wheels. they don't let me stay in one place. hmm. its a good thing I don't have wheels on the bottom of my chair for my desk. although I don't know how big of a problem it would be to have wheels on that chair. because in my room, I have carpet. this is a tiled floor, so that is why the chair is so rolly. when I sit on my roommate's chair, it doesn't move so much. so that must be it. it must be because of the carpet. oh, there goes my stomach. I'm hungry. but I don't want to eat till moiz calls. once moiz and omiar come over, I can order the pizza. but the problem with that, is that I am hungry now. I want to eat now. maybe something small when I get home. but knowing me, my small snack will turn into a meal. oh well. I can wait. I guess. I wonder if they think its cheap that I'm inviting them over on monday. this way I order the cheap monday madness pizza. but I guess its not really a big deal. I was going to invite them over soon. I want my computer up and running asap. I can't believe uncle hafeez gave me a nice new cpu. that is so awesome. but then again, that might lead to problems of me doing less studying, and more downloading songs online. I hope bilal and them come tomorrow. I mean, we don't want to be waiting for them every day, waiting for uncle's call to say oh, well we still couldn't book the tickets, so they will be coming tomorrow. hmm. I smell smoke. but that can't be right. who, no what idiot would be smoking in a building. well, I guess its not that much of an idiotic thing to do. I mean, lots of people do smoke, but I just wouldn't assume that they would be smoking inside a building. ohh kay. now my hands are getting tired. I don't think I was suppose to be typing nonstop for twenty minutes. was I? oh well. that's what I'm doing. haha I can't believe I was so stupid today. I have been going to urdu class at 12 for over a week. what exactly in my mind made me go to class at one. and thank goodness it was ten minutes before one. if I had gotten there right on time, I would have felt like such and idiot walking into class late. especially in a class that wasn't mine! it's a good thing I went and talked to the professor. she is awesome! I really didn't think that she would let me sign in. I came way after the bell rang! anyways, that makes two days of udru homework to do before wednesday. but then again, I have more important things to worry about besides my urdu homework. I have that stupid quiz in english tomorrow. when did all these quizzes come up. it seems like yesterday was only the first day of class. I guess summer went my pretty fast for me. wow. it really did. pakistan was awesome. I don't think I have ever had so much fun in the million times that we went there, not as much as I had this time. and saqib, rashid, and khurram. they are as cool as they have always been. I like the fact that we are all still cool. well, it took a while for us all to open up, but at least we did. and I'm upset with raza. I didn't realize till a little towards the end, that his walkman never left his ears. I don't know, does he not understand? or does he not care? because if he does not care, he shouldn't be coming. that is really bad. and think of what everyone else thought. I'm sure they minded too. ohh. a minute and a half left. weird. it does not seem like I have been typing for twenty minutes straight. I guess this wasn't so bad after all. I wonder what happens after my time is up. will I not be able to type anything else? well, I will find out in 40 seconds. now after this, I got to pick up my I'D from the business school, then. then I dunno. I could either go to the library and finish up my reading, which would be the smart thing to do, or I could go home and study"". but that will never work. hmm, I think I just answered my own question.

1261,"What does the drug ecstasy do to the brain? I have been very curious about this for some time now. Maybe you could tell us what studies have concluded about this drug. The reason why I am so curious is because many of my friends have recently discovered and become enchanted with it. In fact, in about the middle of the second semester of my senior year in high school, it became almost like an ecstasy epidemic! Several of my friends have done it up to 11 or 12 times already! I haven't tried it since I refuse to do drugs but I'm really interested to find out what its long term effects are and why it produces the reaction that it does. Apparently, when on ecstasy, it feels as if nothing can go wrong and everything is perfect. Music is everything and once listening, someone who is rolling (the term used to define the feeling one gets after taking X) can't pull away. Also, they say they feel as if they have ""lungs of steel"" in that they are constantly smoking cigarettes and feel as if they can't stop. Oh, and the mouth chewing. Why does that happen? Their mouths jitter while they're rolling and after the drug wears off, their mouths hurt or feel sore. That's why you can tell when someone is rolling at a party. Well, first of all they're sweating profusely and also they're chewing lots and lots of gum! Its crazy actually. I went to a rave with my friends last Saturday. It was at Austin Music Hall. At least 70% of the people attending the rave was rolling on X. Well, essentially, that's what rave's are for. Its a closed space with djs who spin techno and trance music for a huge group of people, the majority of whom is Xing like crazy! Anyway, my friends had a blast there. of course they were rolling. I had fun too, but not nearly as much I imagine! In fact, it was 3:30 in the morning, we had been dancing for at least 4 hours straight, and one of my friends refused to leave because he was rolling so hard and not remotely tired. Doesn't this sound crazy? What does the drug do to people? Have any severe, longlasting consequences been discovered for sure. I've been told several theories, some of which include the brain bleeding, there being permanent damage on the spine, memory loss, and brain cells being killed. Sounds like some dangerous stuff these people are playing around with. If it weren't an illegal drug, I'd definitely try it (provided it didn't totally screw me up in the future!) considering how wonderful everyone tells me it is. And not just word of mouth. I've seen people on it countless times. They look as if they could die happy right then and there! I don't know if you're planning on discussing anything like this in class but I'm really interested in finding out more about X. Just out of curiosity! Well, I think I'd like to talk about something remotely related. One of the guys whom I'm talking about, in fact, he's in this class with me, is named J. I went to high school with him but we were never friends. We hung out at the same parties with the same group of people generally, but we barely even talked to each other. Well he and his friend are living at Towers together and since we're all down here together we've been hanging out a lot. A whole lot, in fact. And I wasn't really planning on anything happening between us but the night of the rave, a lot of people stayed the night at their place, including me, and we kind of ""hooked up. "" Now, ever since then, we've kind of been messing around well, nothing much. The thing is, we haven't mentioned it to each other at all. We keep doing it but don't discuss it. So I'm not sure what the deal is. I think I like him. well, actually, yes I do like him. The problem is. does he like me? I can't tell either way. I mean, he's a guy so just the fact that he keeps fooling around with me doesn't mean much. He could hate my guts for all I know and still be doing what he's doing just to get some! That would really suck. And I don't want to ask him because, well for one, I wouldn't know what to say. And for two, I'm scared of the answer. That would just be awful if I spill my guts and he totally cops out. And what's worse is if that happens, not only are we in this class together, but we have to go to the same school for the next four years! What should I do? I don't know. I hope something happens soon that'll figure this out for me well, something GOOD that is! I've written a lot more than twenty minutes so I should probably go now. I guess this wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. Whew! ",0
37,"Ok, I'm doing this stream of consciousness thing. MTV is on in the background, and I'm remembering when I went to see them in concert at Jamboree in Tinley Park ,IL. Everyone thinks I'm crazy because I came from IL all the way to Texas. I don't feel crazy though. I wanted a change and I really love it down here. I wonder what Taveau is doing right now. She isn't answering my e-mail. Ok, it's only been a day , I'm just being impatient. Anyway, I wonder why she doesn't go by Taveau. I like it a whole lot better than Melanie. And I seriously wonder if she's straight or not. I just want to come right out and ask her, but that's not really something you want to ask someone you just established contact with. I hate Hanson. They're such one hit wonders. And the one hit is called MMMMMBop. How incredibly stupid is that? They're like a younger , related New Kids. Speaking of New Kids, how about Spice Girls? There's another total lack of talent engineered for success. It's sad when losers like that are valued in our popular culture. What's a great idea? That commercial just said something was a great idea. I know what a great idea would be: if I would start to do my Calculus homework. Sometimes I wonder if I actually want to pass that class. I wonder what I could do to welcome Daniela-my roommate-back home after this weekend. God, she's so stuck on her boyfriend. I guess that 's pretty typical for our age group, but still. I don't know, I guess I just don't understand that level of dependence. Then again I moved from Joliet, IL to Austin, TX with exactly eight minutes of crying. I wonder if that makes me psycho or just morbid or something. Chris Rock is so funny. I love this commercial. Whoever had the idea of having Chris Rock in imitation videos for promos needs to get an award. God, I hope Jewel doesn't come on . That one song makes me so incredibly homesick for my friends. I do miss them , but I don't really miss my parents all that much . Daniela is always telling me how cold that is , but I can't help it, it's not intentional, it's just how I feel. Ok, Jewel did come on, but at least it was just YOU WERE MEANT FOR ME, OOPS I just hit the tab key and scrolled way down to the bottom. I'm so dumb with computers, I swear. I know so much less about them than all the people around me. I'm confident I'll learn, but I just wish we would've had that experience prior to college. Daniela's talking about that one snoopy girl in her Plan 2 group. She's really screwy. She doesn't even know if her computer is a PC or a Mac. I guess I'm one up on her. hey, how much longer am I supposed to write? only a couple more minutes. Oh well. Jamiroquai's on now. I saw him in concert too. Oh, that just made me a little sad. We all went to that concert about two weeks before we graduated, and we all sang FRESHMEN together, and , I don't know. I feel like I'm babbling, but I guess that's pretty much the whole point. I remember Dr. Pennebaker telling us not to worry, some one would eventually read these. Well, I don't really care if anyone reads this or not. I 'm not really saying much of anything. I don't even feel like I'm saying anything important. I wonder if I should have put on that survey thing that I was bisexual. Not only is that non-confidential, but they may not want me because I could upset the demographics of their study. Oh well, I'll let them deal with that. Time's up. I hope this was at least somewhat interesting to whoever got condemned to read this. ",0
123,"this is by far one of the most interesting assignments I have ever had to do  not the first stream of consciousness assignment, rather the first time I have ever submitted anything to an instructor via the web. this technology is absolutely amazing and exciting because it is potentially so very dangerous. it is as if no one is safe anymore. I am very hungry right now and I could really use a lunch break, but there never seems to be any time to afford that type of luxury. I am writing this in the student microcomputer facility and there are a whole lot of computers in this place, I guess they need this many to accommodate 40. 000 plus students, this sure is a big school but there are a lot of advantages that come with that. I am beginning to wonder if this class is simply a tool for all of the psychological researchers at this school. it is obvious that one of the reasons UT has one of the best research departments in the country is that they take advantage of a class that at one point or another every student at this place has to take. this provides for an enormous field from which to gather information. in its own way it is rather sneaky. however, it is not necessarily a bad thing. I am actually thinking of being a psy major. I think I may double major with a BA in music and another liberal arts degree . I sure am glad I switched out of my performance major. I just didnÃ¯Â¿Â½t want to compromise my love of music for the narrow path I was treading. there was simply no t enough room for my own creativity to get involved. my stomach is becoming impatient with me. 20 minutes is a lot longer than it seems. it would be interesting to read different responses to this assignment because I bet that a lot of people think about a lot of different things. . in a class of five hundred it would be hard to have one general make-up. this keyboard is very stiff and rather annoying to type on . oh well. I wonder how much money is spent on computers at this school every year. I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t want to think about it. it is strange being a sophomore in a class with so many freshmen. at least I know what to expect. I am gradually running out of things to write. this type of writing forces you to think about what you are thinking about which is a very strange concept. I think the radio show went well last night  I hope to get all of the technical kinks worked out by nest week so that we donÃ¯Â¿Â½t look so incompetent. I don't think I spelled that right. just goes to show that most of your primary education is soon forgotten. probably why they donÃ¯Â¿Â½t hire people right out of fourth grade. my roommateÃ¯Â¿Â½s hair is orange and pink right now and he wants to bleach those colors out and make it purple. I told him that no one would take him seriously that he needed to be serious about his non-conformity. that word is soooo overused and really annoying. sort of like the e-coli scare or playing the race card. we live in a society of sheep who blindly follow whatever is hip and chic without ever questioning what they are doing. this stream of consciousness is about to come to an end due to the fact that my 20 minutes are just about up if any one had to actually read this, I apologize for the sloppy spelling, bad grammar and weak syntax. I guess that's what being a TA is all about, huh? ",1
1025,"my thoughts, feelings, and sensations?  right now?  my eyes feel vacant, my heart feels heavy. at the moment?  now, in my dorm, in the silence of others and the sound only of ani's enlightening lyrics via stereo, I cannot hide behind the facade of a smile. there is no need to. unless I should be concerned with impressing a professor of some sort with a great stream of consiousness piece of writing. this is my consiousness, and I suppose it really isn't so interesting. I am worried, that is one sensation ripping through my veins. I am worried I will fail french, (how can you teach someone a new language in that language?) I don't understand. I am worried about things that cannot be voiced anywhere. I am worried about things you are not supposed to talk about. not to strangers. not to family. not to friends, unless they don't mind the burden. ""god help you if you are an ugly girl, course too pretty is also your doom"" as ani says. I know what she means; I have felt both ways, too often. I will choose the ugly girl, though. she has the better deal. she doesn't have to be afraid. I never fully understood the truth to this until I came here, to austin, to college. I didnt realize what a risk it is to be a ""pretty girl. ""  this is taking a strange turn, sorry, I havent quite figured out how to regulate my stream of consiousness. but this is what I think about. does he think I'm pretty?  god, I hope not. oh, please let someone else get in the elevator with us, don't leave me alone with him. how fast can I run if he approaches me. these are now everyday thoughts for me. I never used to be like this. I am ashamed of the girl I have become in the last week. I have discovered several things about myself since last tuesday. I am not, in any sense, the righteous babe (an ani term) I thought I was. I am a scared little girl. I cannot stand up to those who hurt me; I have proven that this week. in lieu of retaliation and justice, I cower in the shadows, I cling to my boyfriend, I cry myself to sleep. my mind is full of thoughts, so many I can't sort them all. so only the prominant ones come through to the screen. I apologize that they can't be the happy ones, the ones that say how much I love college, life, and my psychology class. I am not worthy of so many things, I think maybe my hypothalamus doesn't secrete enough of that happy stuff. my feelings are not so great at the moment; perhaps I should have chosen to write this some other time. I am so naive and stupid. those are my thoughts. that I allowed this horror to happen to me, to my boyfriend; that I am doing nothing about it. that I am writing about it here for someone I have never spoken to to read it. I miss my little brother. my baby four year old brother. he is my favorite person in the entire world. I am looking at a picture of him now, holding a wooden sword, pretending to be either david crockett or obi wan kenobi. welp, my twenty minutes are up. thank you, doctor. ",0
1862,"     Hi, well. I'll start out by introducing myself. My name is Christina Acevedo. I am a Freshman here at The University of Texas. Just recently i got off the phone with my girlfriend. aahhh. i love her soo much. We have been together for 4 years and 8 months already. Except, just two nights ago we had a little argument, or should I say   miscommunication  . She told me some things that I really didn't enjoy hearing, and of course, I got upset. and reacted. At that point I didn't really feel like talking to her the rest of the night, or even the next day. But I fell asleep thinking about it. Which wasn't really smart because it made me even more mad. So, that morning I woke up at 8:00 AM to go to my first class. It was one of my farthest classes, so of course I had more time to think. After that class, I came home and wrote her an e-mail. I was so confused and I had so many mixed feelings towards her. I wasn't sure what was going on. Just that I loved her and that I still wanted to be with her. Well, needless to say, we talked about it afterwards. and of course, we're still together. THANK GOD!!  :)  So everything is going really well right now. And I'm glad because we don't live in the same city either, so its not that easy. I come here to UT and she goes to A&M in College Station. And I have to admit, long distance relationships suck, but when it comes down to those one or two or three weekends out of the month that you get to see each other, they're great!  And I guess that's it for that subject. Right now I'm watching Shop Til You Drop. I remember watching this show and Supermarket Sweet a really long time ago. So, they're probably all reruns. Right after I get through with this I am going to go downstairs and have dinner. I'm pretty hungry even though I just had a couple of snacks up here in my dorm. I live at The Castilian. It is really a neat place. And it is a convenient location for me because my classes don't seem to be so far. My parents didn't let me bring my car over here to Austin my first year. I was pretty bummed out about that, but I wouldn't have used it to drive to school anyway. It would be parked here in the Castilian's garage, which by the way, costs $900 for the two semesters. Although, it would come a lot in handy on the weekends when I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends, or to go and visit my girlfriend in College Station. Speaking of which, I saw her this past weekend. (labor day weekend). Me and a friend of mine left here on Saturday morning, it took us about an hour and a half to get there, and then we drove back and partied here. It was a blast!  Although my girlfriend got a little carried away drinking and ended up throwing up for some of the night. But it was ok because she was really fun before we went to bed. We also tried going to a club called BOYZ CELLAR, but my friend (Robyn), the one who picked me up, is 17. So they didn't let her in because you have to be 18, so of course, none of us went in. That pretty much sucked because I was really looking forward to that. I guess we'll just wait for another good weekend and we'll all go because her birthday just so happens to be about two weeks from now. And now about school. Let me tell you, the classes here at UT are not going to be anything easy, thats for sure. I am taking 6 classes (15 hours). I am trying to major in Biology, but. my strong point is absolutely not Biology. And thats because this semester I am taking Biology 211, Biology 212, Chemistry 301, Calculus 408K, Cardiovascular and weight training, and of course, Psychology with you. So, I'm looking forward to a pretty tough semester. I just know that I have to study a lot and listen in class and take good notes and hopefully everything will go my way. I don't really want to start off bad because it is not a good impression on the professors or anybody who is looking for someone to fill a job opening. My goals for the future would have to be that I want to live with my girlfriend, somewhere VERY NICE. And I want to be someone that makes pretty good money. And I want to have a couple of pets. Not too many. And I know that my girlfriend wants A LOT. she probably has been planning some part of her future in her mind. Like, at least what kind of house she wants, or something of that sort. I mean, she already has the exact ring that she wants when she gets married. She wants it to be white gold, with a big   ROCK   on it. Sounds pretty simple, doesn't it?!  :)  So yeah. and. well, I think my parents are going to come up and visit soon. I really didn't want them to come up here, I'd rather go down there. because I think that maybe I would feel awkward having my entire family in my dorm for a while. And then hanging out with them here on the weekend. I think I would be too tempted to just be like, ok. well, I'll see you tomorrow afternoon, and go out to a club or something. But, well. that's all for now. I can't really think of anything else to type. My mind has totally gone blank. I have typed everything that I am thinking and maybe even EVERYTHING that I have thought about the entire day. Well maybe a few exceptions. And the time and minutes on top don't seem to be moving at all. I don't know exactly how much time I have left to type. But the twenty minutes have seemed to go by pretty fast.       ",0
394,"I don't have a clue of why I am feeling this way . I am thinking about many things as I type this paper. One thing is, I hope I have a good freshmen year in college. I was not worried about college until I got up here. Now that It has  started I'm nervous. I'm waiting for the day when I have test in every class, I don't know how I will handle it. I going to have so many things going on such as fraternity stuff. This is going to be gun but I hope I have some free time to study during pledge ship. If  I don't my life will be miserable and I will end up  at good ol cleburne Texas. So far in Austin I fill comfortable when I m around other people but get home sick when I m alone in my room doing nothing. I fill weird because when I was at home I could call my friends and girlfriend and we would go out and do something, now that I don't know a lot of people I can't do that. I fill that your class is going to lots of fun because you came across as a good professor. Tonight i am going out to have fun with my pledge brothers we only have 2 more days of freedom. I hope I  make it to christmas, if I do pledgeship will be done with and I can go on living a normal life. Right now I fill like eating something but I don't know what. Jester food does not go down right. I think that is why I am sick. My brother is  a senior this year and will graduate in December. I wish I was in his place. I'm ready to settle down and hopefully make a good living to support my family. I fill at this time that I want to do something in computers. That is where the money is. the thing is that I'm not ready for really hard classes and bundles  of homework. Well my 20 minutes is up so I'm going to submit my paper and grab a bite to eat. ",0
1222,"I am sitting here wondering as to why I chose to do this assignment at this particular time. As I search my the thoughts the number one reason I can find is BOREDOM. I am so bored right now, as I have throughout my entire UT experience. I miss my friends, my family, my surroundings, my house, and most of all, my king size water bed. I have nothing against my roommate, my dorm, or this college, but I feel that they cannot replace the friends, accommodations, and schools that I have become accustomed to over the past 18 years. I'm pretty sure that I just used a runon sentence. Five minutes down, fifteen to go. Notice that I spelled out the words ""FIVE"" and ""FIFTEEN"" in order to waste. I am wasting this time because I don't feel any need to be introspective. I feel that I know myself pretty well, both strengths and weaknesses, I that I have no need to further analyze my thoughts. I am very surprised how painless that has bee thus far. I'm sure that my high school English teachers would die when if they saw how many sentences I started with ""I"". Although you can not see this, thanks to the wonders of modern technology, it just took me about eight tries to correctly spell the word ""saw"". Did you notice that I also spelled out the word EIGHT. It has now been twelve minutes and it is time for a short bathroom break. I hope that this writing is still here when I come back. I'm back. That took about a minute. Sorry. I meant to right ONE minute. I wonder what other people are writing for this assignment. I wonder how many people will try to suck up by complementing the professor, or how many will tell of their dislike for this class? I wonder how many will try to be introspective and artistic, and end up writing free verse poetry? I feel that such people, who think themselves to be deep and philosophical, are the exact opposite, fake and shallow. I feel that my fingers are not fast enough to keep up with my thoughts. As this assignment comes to an end I wonder what I was supposed to have learned, for I feel that I am none the wiser. TWENTY minutes have now passed. The END. ",0
1337,"My throat hurts. I had a little too much troubling trying to spell throat. I've now discovered hat my brain works much faster than I can type. I hope I'm not getting sick. All I can think about is this assignment. Now I'm thinking about all the things I need to do today. And this weekend, I have to write a rough draft of a paper. I need to go to the library or something. It's really cold in here. My eye itches. I hope they found the people that were smoking in the building last night. That's probably why my throat hurts today. We could smell it through the vents. I need to go to the store. Now my nose itches. Our room looks kind of messy. Can I listen to music while doing this assignment? They'll never know. I have to watch the clock and stop at 10:47. I remember when I heard this song for the first time. I hope it rains today. I don't like Star Jones. She seems really mean and pushy. All I can think about is what should I think about next so I can type it. I need to email my mom after this. I'm trying not to, but I can't help but sensor this. She needs a different haircut. She would look better. Ouch. That hurt my sunburn. I have 8 minutes to go. Oh I really like this part of the song. I love jazz. I think I need to buy some cough drops. I'll out that on my list of things to get at the store. I really like this part of the song too. I need to get my math homework done early. Why did it repeat, I didn't tell it to repeat. Or maybe I did. What was that? I think it was talking chickens. When you turn the sound down, not all commercials are as selfexplanatory as you might think. I needed to know that. I want to go somewhere. I need to drive. I just don't know how to get anywhere.

My roommate is in the shower. She has a sorority thing tonight. I'm not in a sorority. I'm glad, it's not the place for me. A guy died in my hometown last weekend. I t was strange, because my roommate had just commented on deaths happening in threes, and Mother Theresa and Princess Diana had just died. I didn't know the guy at all, but still, that could have been anyone. I think about that a lot. Death. Like what if someone died that I knew, but I had never told them what they mean to me. That's selfish, I know, but that's what we are, we're selfish. We as in humans. A friend of mine in my psych class knew the guy who died. I like country music, but most people don't. I just started liking it last year, because my boyfriend at the time got me hooked on it. My back hurts. I like to rub people's backs. I wish someone was here to rub mine. Tonight I'll be alone in the dorm. I like that sometimes everyone just gets on your nerves. My roommate and I knew each other in high school. We have gotten along amazingly well so far. Knock on wood. I have never been in a car accident, when I was driving. My brother messed up his knee in a car accident. I like this song. He had to have his ACL ligament redone. He can be such a baby. I think men have an amazingly low pain tolerance. I really think that they just aren't as well equipped for pain. That's just a personal opinion. I give lots of personal opinions. People tell me I'm opinionated. I don't like people who can't discuss their opinions and thoughts. It's important to be able to communicate. I'm a speech major. My undergrad advisor is great. I met him at orientation, and I love him. He tells you exactly what he thinks and that is so important. I don't like this song. It's one of those depressing love songs that is so typical of country. I wonder if I'll get married. I think I want to, but not kids. I do not want kids. That's another one of my opinions. How can we bring a child into this world?  So then people ask me if  I wish I hadn't been born. Two completely different concepts. Anyway, I'm gonna call my Aunt Holly. She is like a second mother to me. I live my mother. She really is my lifeline. That's a scary thought, like could I survive without her?  Of course, she raised my to be a survivor. I love basketball. My mom and I watch games together all the time. The Rockets are my favorite team. I also like Dennis Rodman. But I hat e the bulls. Rodman always says what he is thinking. Some people think he's a little tooo crazy, but I love it. H breaks the mold. That's commendable in my book. I miss my cousins. One of them is a big basketball fan. He and I always talk basketball. I'm almost done, twenty minutes did not take as long as I thought it would. I really like this song. I'm finished!! ",1
462,"like how my day was, yeah, I woke up real early today, likie 800 and theres still ab unch of people walking in and out of my room like this one girl who likes my roommate, and I know I left my last topic right in the middle but illcome back, so anyway, this girl that just walked into my room like my oommate, and she seems really nice, and shes cute enough, but someone told my roommate that shes not cute and now he doesn't like her, now I must concede that in the past, I've realized that girls aren't as beautiful as I originally thought, bcause someone else told me they didn't think so and I relized id been projectin something on the girl, or looking a little too hard for something that's not there, so I shouldn't judge or somethinng like that and and so I woke up for an 830 class this morning, and it was a Cal stuy session that was completely pointless, I miss my high school calculus class, I miss my high school cal teacher, she was a very good teacher, I ad lot of those in high school, so I guess I'm pretty lucky, but she was a really good teacher, and a lot of my friends in the class got together ad had a great study group, because, well for many reasons, first of all they werent my best friends, thy were three girls and my brohter, but they werent my best friends, and so I didn't have to worry too much about getting too off topic at the biegginning of the year with stupid inside jokes, we could just study, and later onwhen we became better friends, we could talk for hours about iomportant stuff, or reminice, and still know when to crachk down and actually study, also like I said the teacher was just great, I'm going back this weekend and since its labor day we don't have school on monday so I may just skip school tuesday and stay home to  go back and visit some of my old teachers, and I've only got 6 more minutes of writing, but I really think thatd be nice, uhh I'm out of tuff to say again, and everyone is babbling in the background, and I'm trying to tune him out, or them out, but now I'm losing total train of thought and so I'm going to start babbling again or risk having to stop all together and so I don't have any more classes today and I'm struggling here and my roommates playing playstation, so I went and worked out the other day, actually yesterday, and it was the first time in 4 months, but I'm going running and weight liftin again today, and I havent run in about the same length of time and so I'm sorta worried about taht, but I'm looking forward to it to, getting a little chubby you know, so I'm starting to work out 6 days a week, about one to two hours a day, and I'm worried is going to but a strain on my homework, but I've always been able to to manage time in the past and I just noticed that I've got less than aminute and now I'm done so I'm wrapping up saying goodbye if you ever read this, I ope you enjoyed this little window into my head ",0
1010,"I am really tired today. I am also pretty homesick. It is my birthday. I wish that I was at home. I want to celebrate my birthday with my parents and sister. I want to go to my favorite restaurants. Blue Goose sounds really good, but why am I worried about good restaurants in Dallas. I can get just as good or better food here in Austin. I want a turkey sub for dinner tonight. I also want to go to get ice cream from Aimee's with my friends, but I have so much to do. I have to review all of my notes tonight for my classes, plus I have to go to the sorority pledge class meeting at sometime. I better look up the time soon. I am glad I stayed in and studied this weekend. It helped me get organized and feel like I knew what I was doing. Rush really made me crazy. I hope I like being in a sorority. I am scared because I don't party that much, and I don't want it to take away too much time from my studies. I know that I do have to balance my life. I have to make time to meet people nad have fun. I just never feel like I have enough time to do everything. I feel bad that I couldn't go to lunch with Leisha today because I had to read my phylosophy, but I went to run and then to church this morning and I had to get my stuff done this afternoon to be ready for the meeting tonight. I wish that I was at home and could just relax and watch TV. I miss summer time when I didn't have to do too much. I hope all of my friends in all of their colleges are doing well. The birthday card from Amy made me sad. It already feels like we are drifting apart from each other. Even when I e-mail her, I don't know what to say. I feel like she doesn't care what is going on here because she doesn't know all of people I am talking about when I tell her what I am doing. Why doesn't she tell me a lot about her life?  I want to know what is going on, not just hi how's it going kind of stuff. I am so happy I know my roommate though. We have had so much fun together, and we keep each other sane. I get scared when I think what might have been if I had gone pot luck. I keep meeting people who have crazy roommates, but I think I really could have gotten a long with everyone. I have met the coolest people. That girl I sat next to in Economics the other day, was really neat. I need to get her number. I like my sailor sis in Delta Gamma, but I am afraid to go out with her. I don't know if I can keep up with all of these UT people. They party way more than I do. I think I am going to go home this Labor day weekend because the parties aren't a necessity to meet people. Anyways, nobody who I talk to will remember me because they are all drunk. I don't understand why I go to these paries to  meet people when I can't even have a coherent conversation with people, but I guess they are fun. I am so confused right now, but I think it will all start working out soon. I just wish that I knew everybody instantly and did not have to work so hard at meeting people. In high school I could see anyone and know them. Like at the game last night, I hardly knew anyone, and in high school I could talk to anyone around me. I guess soon enough, I will make new and good friends, but I sure hope it comes soon. Luckily, I have Megan. She has kept me from being sad, plus I really like it in Austin. I love walking around campus and seeing everyone. It is the prettiest campus, and I really like all of my classes. I am really scared about keeping my grade point up. I worked hard in high school and did well, but will it be enough for college?  I sure hope so. I know my parents will be happy as long as I do my best, but sometimes I feel that is not enough. I guess I pressure myself too hard. I just have to keep listening to my parents advice to balance my time between relaxing, socializing, and studying. I will do my best. I know that it will all start being normal to me pretty soon. I just have to wait for the adjusting period to be over. ",1

331,"I have watching Comedy Central for the past hour or so. The program involved people getting paid not to laugh while listening to comedians. If I were one of those people paid not to laugh, I wouldn't pay attention to the actual words the comedians was saying. Listening to the skit would most likely make me laugh, so I would think of something else. I would discuss with myself something really boring, so as not to laugh. Speaking of boring, I received two letters today from my boyfriend. He was talking about being bored in class. He attends A&M, the idiot. My parents don't know he's my boyfriend. They think he's just my best friend since that's what we were all last year. My sister, whose computer I'm using, doesn't know either. I hope she doesn't read anything I'm writing here. If she did, I'm not so sure she wouldn't tell my parents. My mother loves my boyfriend, but I don't think she or my father would let me visit him at A&M if they knew he was more than just my friend. Otherwise, I would love to tell them. They would be so happy for both of us, seeing as how they love him. I just want to be able to have him visit me and me visit him without my parents wondering why we're visiting each other. Plus, my parents are quite protective. I don't know how their attitudes towards him would change if they knew. All of my past boyfriends have been introduced to them only after we became boyfriend and girlfriend. My past boyfriends were very different from my current boyfriend. Their outlook on life, intelligence level, looks, interests, and families were exact opposites from his. He's exceptionally smart, and I'm not just saying that because he's my boyfriend. He loves Einstein, his theories, and computers. My old boyfriends loved roller blading, and non-intelligent ways of spending an evening, if you know what I mean. My boyfriend actually listens when I talk to him. He will also talk if I ask him a question. He doesn't lie to me, which is a big change. In fact, we spend most of our time together just talking about differing interesting things. You would think we would run out of things to say, but there is always more. We've had these talks for at least nine months and still have more to talk about. I can actually see spending the rest of my life with him. I can't believe I just said that. I never thought I'd be able to say that about anyone. Wow, I'm impressed. He's one of the closest things to my heart. It's weird actually talking about this. For the longest time, I didn't want anyone that close. Now it's kind of comforting. Oh boy, I have been typing for quite a while now. Sorry. Bye, and have fun reading this and delving into my soul. ",0
1719,"     It amazes me that I have known about this writing assignment for a while now, and yet I wait to do it until the night before the deadline. I don't procrastinate too terribly much but sometimes I guess I do. I'm really tired. I stayed up until about three in the morning reading for my government class. Then I had to wake up at about seven. I don't even know why I woke up that early. We entered the draw for the OU football tickets and everyone I talked to said to get there early. So I wake up and drag my self down there, with only a few hours of sleep. I was pretty irritated when I found out that it was by number order, so it actually didn't matter. I must have misunderstood when they were giving the instructions. I guess it's just one of those dumb freshman things. I'm actually not as nervous as I expected to be. I came from a town of 2000, smaller than most people's high schools. Everyone told me that I was going to be sad and cry a lot. Suprisingly I haven't been upset once. Sure I miss my mom, dad, sisters, etc. but i've been pretty good. I do miss my boyfriend. He's great. That was pretty hard. I cried more when I left him than my parents. Don't really know what that means. I was just use to seeing him everyday and now I hardly get to talk to him. He's still great though. I hope it all works out okay. I know it will. What's meant to be is meant to be though. I've sort of learned the hard way that I can't decide my own fate, I've tried to change things but they still end up the way I worried they would, but they ended up okay. I guess He does know what he's doing. He's pretty good at it. Yesterday was kind of hard. The September 11th memorial service and hearing the story was sort of difficult. I got to go to New York this summer. My mom took me and my sisters for my graduation. Pretty Nice gift. She and my sisters have had it planned for over a year. It was my middle sister Leslie's idea, but then she was paniced after the attacks and almost didn't go. She was worried that she'd never see her little girls again. It was real sad, but we forced her to go. We had a wonderful time, yet a time that actually makes everything real, and put it all into perspective. It was truly amazing.   In my dorm we have a connecting bath. It's pretty nice but has an awkward smell. It took my roomate and I a very long time to figure it out and it's not jusr the regular bathroom smell. We've been watching our suitemates and figured it out. One of them drinks coffee and has been washing her dishes in the bathroom. Wierd, but I'm glad we figured it out, it was really starting to get on my nerves.   I've really been getting sick. I think I've been sick since I moved down here. I'm sure it's because I'm in a new setting and I don't sleep near as much as I should, but I guess I'll adjust. I called my doctor and he told me I needed Orange Juice, which wouldn't get me well but it would make me   feel better  , and some sleep. It's hard because I still use my old doctor. He's the only doctor I've ever had. I guess it's that comfort zone thing again. I've lived in the same town, on the same street, with the same neighbors, in the same house. I've had the same friends for eighteen years. It's sort of odd to be gone from everything.    The coolest thing happened to me this past weekend. My boyfriend got me tickets to go to Pat Green so I went home. There was a   get together   before the concert so we went over to one of his friend's house. As I was walking in, this girl was coming out, she just looked at me and smiled, so naturally I smiled back. Then she said,   are you Allison Bruce?   I was like Yeah. She looked at me and said,   I'm Crystal.  I was thinking okay?? then she said   your best friend.  She was my best friend from Kindergarten to Second grade. She had to move to Alaska with her family. Then she moved to a little town, lifeguarded in another town where she met her boy friend Weston, who happens to be one of my friends cousins. It's such a small world. Gary and Weston hang out so he has known her for a while. It's so exciting. ",0
2377,"I'm thinking about if I am going to get the job that I want at the PAC at the university it would suck if I didn't I am proud that the OTC called me for a job interview, they said my resume especially my volunteer work was impressive it makes me feel like I didn't waste my time during high school and this clock it makes me nervous so I can't type as fast and I keep having to go back and erase but I like pressure I thrive under it but I don't like time pressure and as for the apostrophes in words I do not like those because I am so used to using slang that I just do not type it anymore and I also hate having to capitalize my I's it makes me mad having to go back. Right now I feel a little stress because I am espcially behind on reading not on purpose but yesterday I had a meeting and I did not know it was going to last 2 hours and a half it threw me off schedule so all I could read was Biology which is another class I don't understand I never like science and getting up in the mornings at 8 does not help either I feel lost in that class it is so difficult I feel like I dumber than everyone else and this feels like a cry for help but it is not I just keep thinking about what Prof. Pennebaker said anyways that class sometimes makes me feel. Like screaming I guess but the Professor is nice he just goes so fast and everyone seems or pretends like they understand and typing on lap tops gets on my nerves because at home I had a divided keyboard the ""flowy"" ones and now I have this laptop and everything is squeezed together it makes me really nervous as for this assignment I like but I feel like I shouldn't say anything incriminating and there go the stupid I's and I forgort to put and apostrophe in shouldn't and the I messed me up again. Well forget it no more caps; the I's are going to be in lower case. Sometimes typing in slang gets to be a bad habit I need to get into the habit of typing properly again oh and this weekend I get to go home though I want to go to the game I have not boguht the sports package and I didn't feel like getting up really early to buy tickets some guy in my floor is selling the tickets for 50 dollars is that a lot I guess so maybe oh and my friend jeremy's a football player so I feel like I should go for him but I'm not going. Now I get to go home sit and do homework college is very stressfull maybe I'll get sick when I go home like Prof. Pennebaker said probably because I feel the migrane coming. I hate migranes I hate having to find a job hopefully I get a good one I have an interview on Tuesday I hope it goes well and that I make it on time because if not it is going to reflect poorly on my but the lady undestood. I wonder how the bus works I keep thinking of the bus stop and how the place is going to look like and of the bus bcause I have seen it once after running to the engineering building because I was late I saw the bus and I think you can only take it there which is kind of sucky but I will take a look around and see if that's how it works. Now I feel like I have run out of things to say I still have to do the experiment for this class I want to do the survey but since I am under 18 I have to get my moms signature and I feel like I should be happy about going home I mean excited to see my mom and my brother but it is like ""huh"" and I hope nothings happens like the bus doesn't break down or like it is ""kidnapped' I know I worry too much but I don't want anything to happen even if it means that I have to do all the homework, I've been trying to check my spelling so this makes it easier on you guys, and what was I talking about I don't kno, I need to make friends me and my roommate get along but I need other friends and now I have 5 minutes left, what to write about anyways back to the making friends I saw wayne who went to my high school and seemed like a pretty smart Asian in the elevator today I feel bad for saying that but most asians are anyways the making friends the friends that I have are okay but I don't really relate to them why I don't kno I feel like they exclude me too much and they don't at least I hope they don't and if they do I don't well hope that they are doing it on purpose but still I have roughly 4 minutes left more like 3 because it is about to be 17 minutes the numbers on these computers are weird anyways well they are not really I am surprised I wrote this much I thought I was going to run out of this to say but I like this assignment when Prof. Pennebaker said it I was like yes no grammar rules I don't particularly like grammar but I try I mean I suck at it in my papers I always score low on it 2 minutes and I have mentioned my time too many times I tried not to look at the clock at the beginning and I did nto so now I keep talking about NOT because I want the assignment to be ove but because some one just slammed their door my head hurts I think it is the flourescent lighting I think that is how u spell that and I just put the letter u for the word you and I am kind of hungry and the clock is winding down and I keep typing faster kind of scared oh well you can keep typing oh my gosh I thought it was over but I am going to stop now because a I don't want to talk for too long and I have to go turn of this light and I am thinking about what I just wrote and what u guys are thinking or will think when u read it and all the noise in the background and if I should put my name at the bottom but I won't because I have the code thing. well this was productive and I did not put well in caps.

194,"September 4, 1997   I am not too sure what to write about. I am hungry right now. I have anorexia nervosa, so I not only am constantly thinking about food, I also won't allow myself to eat it when I want it. I am actually in the recovery stages right now. I have been battling this for two years now, have been in the hospital twice, and have had therapy involving nutritional counseling, psychiatry, and group therapy. The only treatment left for someone in my position is to go to long-term therapy. That treatment would be out of state (in Arizona) and would last at least 60 days. It doesn't sound appealing to me at all, but despite the threats that my psychiatrist has faced me with, it still doesn't make it any easier to eat. The battle is all in my head. It is my mind that will not ""allow"" me to eat when I am hungry, and it is my mind that tells me I don't need to gain weight, that I am not critically underweight, and that I am physically in good shape. The whole thing is very confusing to me. My psychiatrist has shed some light on the whole thing, but still no one can completely explain things like this that involve the mind. I think this class is interesting so far. I have enjoyed reading in the book already because I deal with this stuff on a daily basis. I am constantly battling my mind, and trying to figure out its trickery. My psychiatrist says that this is the best class out of all the ones I am taking this semester. (I think she's a little partial to the subject myself. )   I have to go see her on Tuesday, which is only 5 days away and I am scared half to death. She scares me with her threats to send me to treatment, but like I said, apparently it doesn't scare me enough because it doesn't make it any easier for me to eat. Right now, she has threatened me by saying I will have to go to the treatment center if I haven't gained 15 pounds by a certain date. That date is coming up in two weeks. I have had this agreement with her since the end of June. I am really very scared because I really do not think I have gained near that much. It's strange how I can think about it realistically and know that I am still not eating enough and then my irrational side of my mind will come in and tell me I am fine and don't need to gain. But, as the date comes closer to my appointment, I will start to gradually get more afraid, and get mad at myself for not doing enough. And still, that won't make it any easier to eat a thing. You have to make yourself feel totally like crap if you are going to get over an eating disorder. You won't want to do it, you'll feel incredibly anxious and angry with yourself for letting yourself go. I have experienced this a few times ( like in the hospital), but I haven't been able to do much of this by myself. It seems like it isn't worth it to let yourself feel so bad when you could just avoid the problem and not feel the anxiety. Instead, by ignoring it, you get to feel hungry, tired, irritable, you get to think about food all the time because of your low body weight, you make your family freak out, you risk losing your car and your opportunity to go to college. It seems that the negatives of not eating strongly outweigh the positives of not eaten, and I can logically see that. My mind is just totally screwed up, which the doctors say will get better when my weight and body fat percentage increase. I hope I will make it to the point soon. It's just all too confusing to explain. I am sure everyone thinks I am crazy, but you just can't explain to someone how you feel. I wish there was a cure or some more insight to it. I am interested in what this class has to say about things like this. Maybe I'll get some more insight into it (if that is possible since I live it!)      ",1
2404, I am so happy I can't really explain how I feel just that I am feeling great. I know the reasons why I am so happy I just feel like telling everyone that I am so happy and I just want to smile a lot. I would but other students would probably freak but then that's okay cause there is to many people here in Austin that I don't think anybody would even remember the girl that told them that she was so happy. Anyways I have had so many hard days these past days butI think that I am going to be okay. I don't know why people don't even talk to other people unless they know them. Today I actually realized that eventhough austin is a big university I can make others see me. Okay right now my feet hurt so much I did so much walking today just like the other days. The difference is that I got blissters on my feet and they really hurt but you probably don't want to know that. Anyways I think I have lost weight because my pants fit me loose from when I bought them. Which is good because I usually don't loose weight or gain it just stay the same. Oh if I misspell a word I am so sorry but its just that when I am happy I can't really concentrate on spelling. I'll try not to make so many mistakes. I have gone back and captalized all the I's that weren't captalized. Right about now I feel my brain fried of so much thinking. So I met someone that can become a destraction in my education or can be the best thing that ever happened to be but I can't say who he is. Besides that I am really happy I feel like a new nickel very shiny through the inside and on the outside as well. All this happiness is thanks to God because he has not forgotten me of left me to survive on my own. So thank you so much Jesus because without you I would not be were I am today and who I am. I know that this might make someone feel unconfortable but that is how I feel and what I am thinking so no offence to no one in any way. I so wonder if my mom will come this weekened that would be so great but if she doesn't it's okay cuase I have her in my heart and in a DVD that my sister made for her. So any time I want to hear my mom's voice I just have to see the video and there she is that makes me more happy. I wish I could describe this feeling and share it with every one but I can't. It's great! Anyways my minutes are almost up but after this I am going to do other homework and get things done for tommorrow. I usually start early on things and wake up early to get other stuff done that's the way to do it. One teacher told me that if I wanted to get more of my stuff done to get up early and do them.   ,1
2399,"     So the first week of school has begun and I am not ready at all!  I already feel like I am loosing my mind. Which is not a good way to start off the school year. I am taking some interesting classes though with what seem like some pretty cool professors. First, I am taking CMS 306M, which is a speech class, and that doesn't seem like it will be too hard. Then I am taking ECO 304K with an amazing professor. I am very excited about this class but I have heard that it is a little difficult so I will definatly have to pay attention and study. I am also taking a geography class about weather and climate and my professor is Troy Kimmel-the weather man!  So I am excited about that because he seems like a fun person!  I am also taking EDP369K which is a community service class. We have to do community service every week for at least 4 hours. I think the professor sets us up with backgrounds that are unfamiliar to us and then we go to this business/place and get to experience those things that we normally wouldn't. This class should be interesting. I think it will really give a good perspective of what other people have to go through and it will help me not be so selfish. This class is just something I need to take. Finally, I am taking your PSY class which I am very excited about as well!  Pennebaker seems very laid back and cool. With the music at the beginning of each class, etc. I don't know, I think I might surprise myself and acctually enjoy physcology (however that is spelled). I really need to catch up on my reading sometime soon. I am a sophomore so I am not as scared as I was last year. Last year I was very intimidated so I studied all the time and read every assignment that was passed my way-and in return I ended up with a 3. 888 (which my parents are enthused about!)  But this year I am not as intimidated, so that could either be a good thing or a bad thing. I just really need to get out of the summer mode where I go out every night and do nothing but work and party. I need to calm down and study/read a bit more than I am now. I think I will be okay though because school has only been in session for a few days. So hopefully Ill get my act together soon. Anyway, on a lighter note tonight was our first Chapter Meeting. That's right, I am in a sorority-Alpha Chi Omega-and I love it!  We just went through RUSH where we got all of our new members and they are absolutly amazing. My little Alpha Sis is the sweetest most cool girl ever!  She knows how to control her school work but she also knows how to have a good time!  I just love her. Next week we get our Chi Sis' and then a few weeks after that we get our Omega Sis' then at the end of that we get to chooose our Lil' Sis'-which will be ours for the rest of our college years. So this semester should be very exciting!  This year I am living in the AXO house with my pledge class of '03 and I wasn't so sure about it last year but I really love it!  I am getting to know my Pledge Class SO much better which really brings us closer and actually gives me the pride of calling them my sisters-however corny that may sound!  Haha. Anywho, we have a date dash on Thursday and I am not sure which boy to take!  haha. I always seem to have boy problems. But o well, that's all part of being a college student (I guess). Anywho, there is this one boy who is a Sigma Chi and is halarious and so much fun to be around. And really cute but then there is a Wrangler whos name is Matt who I kind of talked to last semester. He use to be our house boy and we even went on a date earlier before school started. Well even though he may be good to look at he really doesn't have much of a personality!  Which really sucks. I think he's just really shy or something but he always mumbles and doesn't have a whole lotta interesting things to say. I mean, don't get me wrong he is a super sweet guy and I tottally trust him. And he's 21 (haha). But I can't help it if I am not attracted to someone. I mean in reality personality is everything even if this guy is amazing to look at. But in a way I feel like I owe it to him to invite him to our date dash. But then again I don't want to lead him on and then ""break"" his heart. Because that's just cruel!  Okay, then there is another guy who reminds me of my ex-boyfriend (but in a good way). He is super cute and very interesting. I think I could hold several very interesting/intelligent conversations with him. I think he could teach me a lot about life in general. Anywho, my sweetmate introduced me to him and she really wants me to take him to this Date Dash and I would LOVe to go with him but I feel like I owe it to these other guys, that I have been spending more time with. So right now I am a very confussed person-and considering it is Monday night I kind of need to make up my mind really fast. Okay, so there's the Sigma Chi-names Forest-who is one of those guys that is supper fun but not long-term quality. Then there's Matt-the Wrangler-who is so nice but I would feel quilty leading him on by inviting him. Then there is Ryan who is someone I look very much foward to getting to know better. So we shall see how things go. I know everything happens for a reason so I will just follow my heart now and either way things will work themselves out!  Right??  Well, I have now been typing non-stop for 18 minutes. I guess I had a lot to get off of my cheast. This is a good assignment because it always us to do what we should do every day. just let it all out!  Haha, good idea!  O yeah, I tried signing up for an experiment project but then I realized I signed up for the wrong day so I hope that doesn't affect my grade. Whopps!  O well, there's nothing I can do about that now. This weekend is our first home football game which I am very excited about!  We play North Texas and we should whopp some beee-hind!  I can't wait~ ",1
634,"I have read for classes almost all day. I can't concentrate on anything that I start to do. I will read a couple of pages, and then I will take a break, or I will do something else. I don't want to get behind, but I just am not motivated at all. I want to have all my reading done for my classes before I go to them. Everyone tells me that it will help me to understand the lectures. I don't want to be catching up all week. I want to try to get my reading assignments for next week done before I go home for Labor Day. I am excited about going home on Thursday. I don't want to have to read anything while I am there. I have not seen my friends for almost three weeks, and I will finally get to see them, not just talk to them on the phone. I don't really talk that long to people in the phone. I have only talked to my best friend three times in the two weeks that I have been here. I feel like I have been in Austin forever. I came to school early for Rush. Sometimes I wish I would not have gone through Rush. I did not get into my first choice sorority, but I got into one with really nice girls. I don't know whether this is something that I want to do anymore. I don't even know if I can get out of it. I just can't wait to go home where life is normal. I just want things to be like they have been all of my life. In the past two weeks, my whole life was turned upside down. I don't feel like I have to stay here. I feel like in the next few weeks this will all be over and I will go back home where I have always been. I do enjoy my classes. Right now, they do not seem to hard,  but I am sure they will get much harder. I only know one person (at the most) in my classes. I feel like I do not have any friends. I meet all kinds of different people, but I would not consider them my friends. Even some of my high school friends are not my friends any more. My best friend all through high school is the only person that I still talk to. I dated my other best friend during high school, and we were finally becoming friends again after breaking up, and then it was time to leave. Now, I find out that he was lying to me about almost everything. I don't understand why he could not tell me the truth. It is not like I care who he dates, but it would be nice to hear it from him, and not from other people. I don't know about other people. All this makes me question all the people who I thought were my friends. I just feel like everything is spinning out of control, and I can't do anything to stop it. I would really like to feel settled here. I want to feel like this is my home. I know that it will take time. I just wish time would elapse quickly. I think things will get a lot better once I get into sorority and school a little more. ",0
322,"This blank screen is staring at me and my fingers are moving in my peripheral vision and this screen is so retarded. I wonder why I put 3 dots at the end of that sentence and who made that up anyway. my shoulders are getting sore-I probably shouldn't type with my arms straight out like this. I wonder if that helps combat carpal tunnel syndrome-ok, IÃ¯Â¿Â½m going to scoot up. I can't believe its Sat at 700 PM and I'm writing this. I'm such a nerd. actually I'm not. ,. I'm cool--but that's all relative I guess. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m really into drinking my coffee and IÃ¯Â¿Â½m staring at my green porcelain coffee cup with its drip coffee stains already on the side from where my lips have been. steam is rising out of the top and I really want to pick it up and have a sip of it but then this writing isn't continuous is it?  Jewel is playing in the background volume 5 and she's kind of distracting. here comes foolish games. I can totally relate. I wonder if Scott is thinking about me right now--I hope he's not the T. A for this class. This is so incredibly weird. I think I like him but IÃ¯Â¿Â½m not sure. he reminds me of Scott wolf and I can't stand him is that a bad sign?   I like Richard's accent too. wow English accents are really cute. Like in London. all of the guys were so amazing. especially that one in the subway that looked like Gavin Rossdale but he was speaking Italian so I doubt it was him. I wonder How Liz is doing?  And Michelle?  Why isn't Ken calling me?  I hate it when guys ask for your number and then never ever call you back. or else they wait a really long time to do it. Kind of like max. I wonder how he's doing I wonder about his dumb model sister in Paris. whatever. I love Jewel. I want to play piano right now even though I haven't played in six years. my gosh it's 7 :20 already and this is pretty fun. I should probably get a diary and do this in it but then what if someone reads it and thinks I'm a rambling idiot?  I have an ache in my heart about the council. I wonder why my name isn't on the list?  I swear, my application was the best one out of all of them. They are so retarded. Maybe it was too sweet and idealistic. maybe they think I'm full of crap and Making it up. but I really think that way. Maybe it's cause I was listening to Jewel at the time,. I wonder when my roommates are getting home  they are so active. of course they didn't have to get up at 700am this morning for crew tryouts. Ok, I probably didn't make it cause those chicks are total hosses. I have a lot of respect for those girls on the team. I wonder if St4eve will get back to me on being the coxin. I have no idea how to spell that word. my tongue is dry and why did I staple ScottÃ¯Â¿Â½s number to an orange sticky note so it's staring right back at me?  He writes like such a guy. My walls are so bare. and the st4reaks of light from the blinds are coming in golden. I wish I could write songs like Jewel. I want to play the guitar well too. I miss my Dad. he's staring back at me from my wall and he looks kinda sideways and I wonder why I returned that dress. this screen is so confusing I lose my place my toe hurts and I feel full. My wrap was gross though. I can't believe they didn't take my CDs--theyÃ¯Â¿Â½re so retarded. My tailbone hurts and I hope I'm not sore tomorrow Steve was a bit extreme. I keep hitting the wrong keys I really need to get to the container store and get some hangers but I know I need to do my homework. I hate calculus homework. IÃ¯Â¿Â½m dreading it. I wonder why IÃ¯Â¿Â½m so down and pessimistic today?  I'm usually not. Oh--gosh, I've got so much stuff to do and organize and my thirty minutes is about done. I wonder if I typed more than other people did and I wonder if a TA. actually reads all this crap and how he grades it?  weird. Maybe I should play my guitar. ",1
1593,"     This is the first writting assingment. I don't realy know what I am soposed to write about. I am also afraid that I will mispell a lot of words. I was talking with a friend on the way to class today. And we started to talk about this assingment. It made me kind of nervouse. But I guess he survived so I will too. I can't belive that only two minutes have passed. I guess that is why it takes so long to write all my papers. And why they are so short. Some times I write a stream of consciousness down on paper. I think it is a good way to get my mind clear. If you write it all on paper you can forget it all for a while. Then after you have rested with it all off your shoulders you can read thoguh it and see if any of it was something important that you need to look into or if not ohh well at least you no longer are thinking about it. I feel like   i should be talking about something more important. But I don't have anything important to talk about. My friend, The guy I mentioned earler, He said that he made sure that he was in a bad/wierd mood befoer he started writing so that way he would have a lot to write about. I think that was probably a good idea. I kind of wish I did that. I feel like I am running out of things to say. So I guess that I will talk about what I see hear smell. Well I am in my room. I see the wall in fromt of me. I hear the computer game my room-mate is playing. He always plays a computer game. Always. but he is a real good guy. The computer game he is playing is some shoot um'up game. You run around with a gun ald kill people, Sleep with one eye open you say right? No its cool. Well I hear all the guns and what not and in the back ground, I guess because he can multi-task I hear music. he plays music movies and this game all at the same time. 10 Min!!! I don't like the song that just came on. What I see I see pictures on my wall. One is with my friend Laurie, We were at Camp in North carolina. We were in her cabin before the campers came. She had these two toy firefighters helmets in her cabin, that light up and have a siren when you push the button. So we were running around camp with them on our heads. It was kind of fun. I have know Laurie for a long time. We grew up togther. We went to camp togther and youth group conventions. She is realy up beat and friendly. Camp is a great place. I went there when I was a kid, And now I have been staff the past three summers. It is real wierd to see these kids come back evry summer and be a year older. They are so different. They were adorable or obnoxiouse. and now they change or are still the exact same way. You remember when the dident have braces. And now they are getting them off. I remember  when I had breaces. I hated them. But I only had them for one year. I had friends who had them for a long time. Four more mineuts. I realy can't spell and I wish I could. I am at a loss again. My desk is made out of wood. But it is not real wood. It is composit. It is a good desk it does waht it need to. My phone just rang. My room-mate just picked it up becaise I am on the computer with you. It is my friend Lyndia she  was calling me back. I called her before I started writing. We were soposed to go to the gym. But I think she is there now. Ohh well. So maby abeer jon and I will got down to th  ",0
2054,"Wow 20 minutes of typing, that is cool. Man I lki this song. I wonder what other home work I have to do. ohh well this is cool, to bad I have already done this before. I liked my high school psychology class, it was fun. I wonder how I am going to do in this class. man it has only been two minutes. I don't know what my roommates infatuation with this 24 show. whatever floats his boat. wow running out of things to think about. man that rat, ejaculation thing that the doc talked about today was great, I was really intrigued. I wonder if that could work with women, if so I would be the man. I would make millions, because ugly people like me would be irresistible to hot ladies. wow that would be awesome!  ohh well it is only a dream, but I can dream can't I, yeah. I need to get better organized, maybe I'll call my house see if I can help them out. making fell thugged out , I'm felling on your booty. then hands up, get drunk throw your hands up. man r kelly is the man, to bad he is a pedophile. I think that is how you spell it?  twelve minutes to go baby. all right what is next?  I am going blank. I hope I can find some program to rid of these stupid pop up windows. they are so annoying. I want to find the people that create these and ring their necks. there are so many hot ladies here at ut. my classes are all right, they are not as easy as I pictured them, damn stone turn the tv down, I can hear it through my headphones. roommates, what can you do. naww I'm just playing he is really cool and he puts up with a lot of my crap. good man. what is thouing thouing?  r kelly you are a genius. why does my neck pop so much?  I think that I messed it up when I used to wrestle in high school. seven minutes to go. wow it has gone by pretty fast. I wonder if anyone is going to read this?  if so it will take them forever to read all of our essays. ohh well that is what they get paid to do. I ride spinners, I ride spinners. this song is off the hook man. all I need to do is get a crunk beat and repeat a word over and over, and I would make millions of dollars. I would be a rapper. they could call me whitey, or white coco. that would be hilarious. something like that. this is the way we ball. I had to change songs, the other one was messed up. three minutes to go. well this has been fun, its about midnight and I am a little tired. whatever. blah blah. I can't think of anything. crap. think, think. that think my brother did was great, I need to do it to someone. I gots ultimate practice tomorrow. I'm going to be dead. 20 seconds, man this was just enough 10 seconds, done! ",0
266,I'm wondering how long it's going to take me to find a girl I really like and if girls look at me as cute or a skinny dork. I miss my dog and the country life I use to live in. I'm scared of not making the baseball team and not completing my goal of pitching in the majors. I'm pissed off at my parents for not getting me a new car for graduation. I'm wondering if people act like they're cool with me when I'm around and make fun of me when I leave. I wish I had perfect teeth so I wouldn't have to get braces. I'm wondering if I'll ever forget my first love and if she'll ever forget me. I wonder why people look down on pot smokers even though their parents probably did it. I wonder when I'm a upper classman if girls will want me more and if I'll look different. ,0
1177,"I met this guy Mark Thursday and today we had breakfast together. I really like him, but I don't know how to express myself around him. I get a selfconscience feeling, but he seems excited when we talk. I have a nervous tick in my stomach when I think of him, like now. I feel like calling or emailing him, but I can't find the guts to. At breakfast, it took my five minutes before I could stop shaking. No one noticed but I could feel my knees quiver. School is not exactly what I thought it would be. There is so much reading, and I don't know if I'm absorbing it all into my brain. So many fun things to do, I make myself sit and read. I try so hard to focus on the page and words, but my mind wanders. I try to read ahead to be prepared for the next class, but I suffer as much failure as I do success. I have a club meeting tonight and tomorrow night and I'm lucky if I get the times and meeting places correct. I guess that's why I bought a cool UT planner which I carry with me everywhere! My mom was the same way I am. She procrastinated more in college than I am and did very well. I don't want to fail. I think about failing and it makes my stomach hurt and I zone out, pushing the thoughts of failure to the back of my mind, but they always pop out again. I miss the familiar faces and places of Port Lavaca. I miss driving my the bay in the evening and the sounds of the cottonwood trees in the front yard. Tears come to my eyes. I haven't cried in a very long time, not even when I came back from the long Labor Day weekend. When I talk on the phone with my parents I swallow the lump in my throat and hold back the tears. I want to succeed here and I'm am doing a good job of breaking the university into a smaller, less overwhelming place. As a little girl, I came to many UT football games. My dream was to be a student here. Considering I was in the top ten percent of my graduating class the task was not a hard one. I love the university and I'm glad I choose UT over Southwest Texas. Southwest does have the best Speech Pathology program in the state, but I can not see myself anywhere, but here. When I think of that the sadness goes away, but I'm still left with an incredible amount of work that I am trying to accomplish. My dad works very hard. He only went to college for two years, and then to work for the family company. I can't tell if he likes work. He almost hates his sister's husband. I don't like him either. A total jerk and I feel sorry for my cousins, one of whom only calls home when my aunt is there. I think my dad is happy. He always coached mine and my brother's basketball league games. He loved it. He was an average student in high school, most likely had ADD or ADHD. We've always been close, but sometimes I feel like he disregards my feelings. We're both athletic, but I got the heavier build of my mother and my dad is slender, but muscular. Sometimes my dad gets mad at my brother and I, but our mother tells us that he always feels bad afterwards. I hope he knows I love him very much. ",1
2208,"well another week of classes has started and I can't wait until this weekend. I just want to relax for a while. there is so much to do during the week. I start on one thing then I have to work on something else. there is like ten million things to do. I am taking these hard classes and I hate them. I have to read a lot of course, but oh well. I have a quiz tomorrow in my Bio 211 discussion class. gosh I hope am ready. I really want to do well. its my first quiz. am going to be nervous. I did study some last night. I am extremely tired because I stayed up late looking over stuff for bio 211. I feel I am not fully prepared. but then I study so hard I go take the quiz and what if I fail. I hate that feeling. I study so much but then my hard work wont pay off. I feel so awful that I cry, I know crying doesn't do anything. but its just you work so hard and you want to do well. I am going to study some more tonight though. I want to go over to jester and go to the learning center for my calculus homework due soon. gosh so much to do today. right now am just tired and hungry. I ate junk food last night. the cafeteria was closed and I just didn't feel like going down to the strip by myself. I just always want someone there with me. I am scared though to walk on the strip by myself. maybe this weekend I will walk on the strip in the afternoon by myself. I want to go look at the stores and just walk and chill out. I am just stalk in this cubicle just putting my head into the books. its like I need to get out get some fresh air. its just am so stressed and I know I got too much to do its like I don't even have 10 minutes to just relax. there is so many things to do on campus and I want to join clubs and get to know some new people. I want to join like the medical clubs and maybe a Persian club. that would be fun. I want to meet some Persian people on campus since I am Persian too. its fun to meet someone from your own culture. you can relate to them and stuff. I just need to get out there and explore my possibilities. I need to join some clubs not just for writing in you resumes but for fun and to learn and explore and also to meet people who are also interested in the same things you are. I want to go to the medical field so I need to join some medical organizations. I am sure there are many of them. I am a biology major and now am thinking to change my major to psychology. I think psychology will be an interesting field. I talked to my cousin who recently graduated from medical school and she said it would be a great idea. I want  to do something that I am interested in and like to study. biology is hard but any subject is hard, but now the classes am taking I am just not having fun and its really stressing me out and I want to do something that I will enjoy. and I want to get into medical school. I am sure every person who applies to medical school like probably most of them are biology majors. I don't want to be a biology major. I want to stand out. I want to be different. I also think that if I don't get into medical school then what am I going to do with a biology major besides teaching and maybe working in the lab, but is it really what I want to do? if I don't get into medical school am sure there are many possibilities with a psychology major. I can go to graduate school and such and maybe be come a psychologist. I think that would be more fun and interesting. gosh all am thinking about now is how hungry I am, ha-ha. I didn't eat any breakfast this morning even though I have lots of junk food in the dorm room, that I can eat. I will wait another hour or so to go have lunch with my roommate. my next class isn't until 1230. so I have plenty of time until then. I am going to study some more for my quiz on tomorrow and maybe I will eat something to before lunch, because right now I am way too hungry. I am glad I have some food in here. its not healthy but I am just way too hungry. I want to take a nap too, but am not going to I will try to go to bed early tonight maybe. well see how long it will take to finish up at the learning center. hopefully I can be done by 9 or 930. I am going to leave the dorm around 630 or so, so I can be at jester by 7. I want to finish my calculus homework so I wont have to worry about it that much. I already got enough stuff to worry about and do. I just want tomorrow to be over with. after tomorrow's quiz I think I will be okay. ",0
1244,"I am tired now. I don't know what I should talk about. I like this assignment. Wonder when it's due? Kristi Urey is the most beautiful person I know. I love you. I mean I love her with all of my heart, mind, body, and soul. I like psychology in high school. It was very interesting and personal. That draws people in or so I think. Psychology is the food of the sea. My roommate's a weirdo. He wears a hat to watch Conan O'Brien. My other roommate got his computer from Dell today. I like Kristi. I may not be a smart man, but I know what love is. Someone's going to be sorry, like all you witches and all you slime and all you whitewigged pinheads who make screwing a big crime. You twistedup my life and spit on all my dreams and made me hate myself. Now come on shoot me set me free. I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts standing in a row. I don't like boy bands. I love food. I love my computer. I love the Internet. I have had a computer for four years+. I view myself as an expert in computer engineering. I don't think I can think anymore. My brain's broken. I'm bleeding internally. I'm a nervous wreck. I deserve respect. I'm walking a tight rope without a circus net. I was invited to my first frat party tonight, which I didn't attend. I don't think my girlfriend/fiancee would have liked me to go to that so I didn't go. Cased closed. Time's up! ",0
